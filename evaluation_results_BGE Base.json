Fortunately for employees, many popular employer-provided benefits are excludable from income.\n    Many employer-provided benefits are subject to nondiscrimination rules that prohibit discrimination in favor of highly paid or key employees.\n    An employer has legal responsibilities with regard to the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA, or Social Security/Medicare tax) and the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA, or unemployment taxes). When determining whether a particular benefit is subject to employment taxes, the rule is that unless the Internal Revenue Code specifically excludes a benefit from wages, it is subject to employment taxes.\n\nRules for employer deductibility\n    In order to be deductible by an employer as a trade or business expense, the expense must be (Reference 1 below):\n1. an ordinary and necessary expense of the taxpayer-company's trade or business;\n2. paid or incurred during the tax year in which it is deducted; and\n3. connected with a trade or business conducted by the taxpayer.\n    The value of a noncash benefit, along with other compensation, must be reasonable in amount (Reference 2 below).\n\n   Pointer: The timing of the deduction generally depends on whether the company uses a cash-method or an accrual method of accounting. If the cash method is used, expenses are deductible in the year they are paid (Reference 3 below). If the accrual method is used, they are deductible in the year in which they are incurred (that is, in the year in which all events have occurred that determine the fact of liability and when the amount of liability can be determined with a reasonable accuracy)(Reference 4 below).\n   An employer may deduct the cost of a noncash benefit paid to an employee and not its value.\n   Caution: Even though the value of a noncash benefit is included in an employee's gross income, the employer may deduct only its cost.\n\nFor more information ...\n   An employer's tax treatment with regard to a specific type of benefit is addressed in the chapter at which the benefit is discussed.\n \nREFERENCES \n\n1 Code Sec. 162(a)(l); Reg. \u00a7 \u00a7 1.162-l(a) and l.162-7(a).\n2 Code Sec. 162(a) (1); Reg.\u00a7 l.162-7(a).\n3 Reg.\u00a7 1.461-l(a)(l).\n4 Reg.\u00a7 l.461-l(a)(2).\n5 Reg. \u00a7 l.162-25T(a).\n"

Because several different payments contribute to TrOOP, CMS awarded a contract to NDC Health to provide coordination-of-benefits systems. NDC Health is responsible for systems that will monitor TrOOP on a pharmacy level so that beneficiaries can question their pharmacists about how close they are to catastrophic coverage. To ensure accuracy of this information, NDC Health is required to route claims for benefits paid by entities other than Medicare to the prescription drug plans. This requirement ensures that what seniors pay at pharmacies takes into account the appropriate level of their Medicare coverage.\n\n\nTABLE\t21-1\nMedicare Part D Standard Benefit Design Parameters\n\n\t\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\nAfter the deductible is met, the beneficiary pays 25% of covered costs up to total prescription costs meeting the initial coverage limit\tDeductible\t$265\t$275\t$295\t$310\t$310\nCoverage gap (donut hole) begins at this point\tInitial coverage limit\t$2,400\t$2,510\t$2,700\t$2,830\t$2,840\nIncluding the coverage gap, catastrophic coverage starts after this point\tTotal covered Part D drug out-of-pocket spending\t$5,451.25\t$5,726.25\t$6,153.75\t$6,440.00\nplus a\n$250\nbrand rebate\t$6,447.50\nplus a 50%\nbrand\ndiscount\nTrue out-of- pocket costs including\nthe donut hole (deductible+ initial coverage+ coverage gap = true out-of- pocket (TrOOP) cost)\tTrue\nout-of-pocket threshold\t$265.00\n$533.75\nSi3,051.25\t$275.00\n$558.75\nSi3,216.25\t$295.00\n$601.25\nSi3,453.75\t$310.00\n$630.00\nSi3,610.00\t$310.00\n$632.50\nSi3,607.50\n\t\t$3,850.00\t$4,050.00\t$4,350.00\t$4,550.00\t$4,550.00\n\tCatastrophic Coverage Benefit\n\tGeneric/ preferred multisource drug\t$2.15\t$2.25\t$2.40\t$2.50\t$2.50*\n\tOther drugs\t$5.35\t$5.60\t$6.00\t$6.30\t$6.30*\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Coverage is either the greater of 5%, or the values in the table above.

(Reference 1 below) Joint filers with modified adjusted gross income (AGI) below $190,000 (single taxpayers with modified AGI below $95,000) can contribute up to $2,000 per child per year in a Coverdell ESA The $2,000 limit is not indexed for inflation.\n        Contributions to a Coverdell ESA are not deductible under federal or state law, regardless of the modified adjusted gross income of the grantor. However, amounts in the account (including earnings) will not be taxed upon distribution to the grantor or the beneficiary (or subject to penalty or gift taxes) if used to pay for qualified educational expenses incurred by the designated beneficiary at a college, vocational school, elementary school or secondary school, including private and religious schools.\n        EGTRRA sunset provision repealed. Under EGTRRA, the maximum annual contribution that could be made to a Coverdell ESA increased from $500 to $2,000 for tax years through December 31, 2012. The annual contribution limit phaseout increased for joint filers to eliminate any marriage penalty. EGTRRA also expanded the scope of qualified education expenses to include elementary and secondary education expenses in addition to those for higher education.\n        The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 repealed the sunset provision of EGTRRA and also made permanent certain corresponding rules and provisions regarding Coverdell accounts for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. Thus, the maximum annual contribution that can be made to a Coverdell ESA will remain at $2,000 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. (Reference 2 below)\n        The annual contribution limit will be phased out for joint filers with modified AGI at or greater than $190,000 and less than $220,000. For other filers, the modified AGI phaseout amounts will remain at or greater than $95,000 and less than $110,000. Taxpayers with modified AGI at or above the $220,000 or $110,000 phaseout range ceiling will not be allowed to make contributions to a Coverdell account on behalf of any other individual. When the modified AGI threshold is met, the $2,000 maximum annual contribution will be reduced by an amount that bears the same ratio to $2,000 as the amount by which the contributor's modified AGI for the tax year exceeds $190,000 for joint filers ($95,000 for all others), bears to $30,000 for joint filers ($15,000 for other taxpayers). (Reference 3 below)\n        Taxpayers with unused funds in Coverdell ESAs may want to explore rolling over those amounts into a 529 college savings plan. See KB-1 Topic 2880. EGTRRA's tax\u00adpayer-friendly revisions to those plans were made permanent by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n        Pointer: Individuals are authorized to take distributions from traditional or Roth IRAs to pay for qualified higher education expenses. In the event that the individual has not attained age 59 and one-half, the distribution will not be subject to the IRS Code Sec. 72 10-percent penalty tax. However, the withdrawn amount will subject the individual to federal and state income tax, even if the amounts are held for over five years and are used for the college education of a child.\n \n\nREFERENCES\n \n\n1 Code Sec. 530, as added by P.L. 105-34 and amended by P.L 107-16, P.L. 107-22, P.L. 109-35, P.L. 109-280, and P.L. 111-312.\n2 Code Sec. 530, as added by P.L. 105-34 and amended by P.L 107-16, P.L. 107-22, P.L. 109-35, P.L. 109-280, P.L. 111-312 and P.L. 112-240.\n3 Code Sec. 530(c) (1).\n"

Generally, an employee is not entitled to recover any unused amounts in the FSA at the end of the year, however.\n\nA health care FSA cannot be used to pay for other health care insurance premiums.\n\nDependent care assistance FSAs are limited to $5,000 per year. In 2020, the maximum limit on salary reduction contributions to health care FSAs is $2,750.\n \nUse of FSAs\n\n\tAn FSA provides an account in an employee's name that is used to reimburse the employee for certain personal expenses (see KB-1 Topic 2250). They are provided by employers as a way for employees to pre-fund dependent care, medical, or dental expenses in pre-tax dollars (see KB-1 Topic 2210). Health care spending accounts (see KB-1 Topic 2215) and dependent care spending accounts (see KB-1 Topic 2270) are subject to special rules and limits.\n\n\tEnrollment form. An employee wishing to participate in an FSA must\ncomplete an enrollment form. Amounts placed into the FSA are deducted from the employee's paycheck (see KB-1 Topic 2265).\n\n\tTax treatment If the FSA is \"forfeitable\" (that is, if the employee does not have the right to receive any of the unused amounts left in the account at the end of the year), the reimbursements made through the account are excluded from the employee's taxable income (see KB-1 Topic 2240).\n\nPointer: IRS proposed regulations relate to the administration of cafeteria plans and the benefits that can be offered as a part of a cafeteria plan as well as flexible spending accounts (FSAs). The proposed regulations incorporate changes made by legislation since previous proposed regulations were drafted. The regulations also consolidate and withdraw prior proposed regulations. The rules contained in the proposed regulations are substantially unchanged from the withdrawn proposed regulations, with only minor changes to reflect legislation and for clarification. The withdrawn proposed regulations were organized in question-and-answer format, but the current proposed regulations have abandoned that format. The proposed regulations may be relied on for guidance pending the issuance of final regulations.\n\nProp. Reg. \u00a71.125-5 contains the rules for the inclusion of an FSA in a cafeteria plan. The regulations retair1 the uniform coverage and use-or-lose rules and include the general requirements of a qualified FSA plan. The proposed rules also retain the forfeiture allocation rules in the prior proposed regulations and clarify that the employer sponsoring the cafeteria plan may retain forfeitures, use forfeitures to defray expenses of administering the plan or allocate forfeitures among employees contributing through salary reduction on a reasonable and uniform basis.\n\n\tLevels of coverage. A single FSA may provide participants with different levels of coverage and different maximum amounts of reimbursements.\n\nExample 1: An employer with 1,000 employees maintains a cafeteria plan under which the employees may elect several benefit options, including insured health plans and HMOs. The plan provides that the required premiums or contributions for the benefits are to be made by salary reduction. Even though the plan may characterize employees' premium payments and other contributions as flexible spending contributions or credits, the operation of a cafeteria plan to permit employees' contributions to be made on a salary reduction basis does not, standing alone, cause the plan (or any benefit thereunder) to be treated as an FSA.\n \nExample 2: An employer with 1,000 employees maintains a cafeteria plan under which the employees may elect, among other benefits, a level of coverage under an arrangement that will reimburse medical expenses incurred during a year up to the specified amount elected by the employee. The maximum amount of reimbursement that can be deducted for a year is $2,750. Because each employee's premium for such coverage is equal to the maximum reimbursement amount selected by the employee, this arrangement is a health FSA.\n\nReimbursements for transit expenses\n\n\tThe IRS has approved final regulations governing reimbursement accounts that cover certain employee transportation expenses. These reimbursements must be\u2022 made under a \"bona fide reimbursement arrangement.\" The arrangements resemble FSAs in the way that the benefits may be provided under compensation reduction arrangements and the employee must provide proof that he or she incurred the expense prior to receiving reimbursement of the expense (Reference 1 below). These reimbursement accounts constitute qualified transportation fringe benefits under Code Sec. 132 and should 'not be confused with health FSAs or dependent care FSAs under Code Sec. 125.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFor a discussion of tax treatment of flexible spending accounts, see KB-1 Topic 2285.\n\nFor a discussion of qualified transportation fringe benefits, see KB-1 Topic 3350.\n\nFor more information, see KB-1 Topic 39,150 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n\n1 IRS Reg. \u00a7\u00a71.132-5 and 1.132-9.\n"

In return, the insurer requires employees to pay a deductible amount each year before coverage kicks in. Once the deductible has been met, the insurance company will pay the majority of each bill (usually 70 to 80 percent), and the employee pays the remainder (the co\u00adinsurance charge) of 20 to 30 percent.\n\n                       Fee-for-service plans have been largely replaced by HMOs and PPOs. Indemnity plans give participants complete freedom to chose their providers, but that means that there is no network and no negotiated fee structure, so premiums are higher than with other types of health care plans. As a result, younger, healthier employees tend to move to HMOs and PPOs, causing indemnity plan premiums to increase even more as the number of participants decreases."

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - General Approaches\n\n\tThere are two general approaches to consumer-directed medical expense plans-defined-contribution medical expense plans and the use of savings accounts.\n\nDefined-Contribution Medical Expense Plans\n\tEven though some consumer-directed approaches for medical expense plans are still relatively new, they have existed in the form of the defined-contribution medical expense plan for some time. For example, many employers make two or more medical expense plans available to their employees, such as an HMO, a PPO, and an indemnity plan. The employer contribution to the cost of coverage for each plan may be a dollar amount that is pegged to a fixed percentage of the cost of the least expensive plan, usually an HMO. Therefore, an employee who elects a more expensive PPO or indemnity plan must make a greater out-of-pocket contribution for his or her coverage than if the HMO had been selected. Certain forms of cafeteria plans also incorporate a defined-contribution approach for medical expense plans.\n\nEXAMPLE\nThe Weir Corporation makes three medical expense plans available to its employees-an HMO, a point-of-service plan, and a PPO. For self-only coverage, the corporation pays an amount equal to 90 percent of the cost of the least expensive plan, which is the HMO. For the three plans, the employee contribution is as follows:\n\nTotal Monthly Premium\tEmployer\tEmployee\n\t\t\tContribution\tContribution\nHMO\t$344.00\t$309.60\t$34.40\nPOS Plan\t413.34\t309.60\t103.74\nPPO\t523.86\t309.60\t214.26\nThe corporation uses a similar approach to determine the cost of dependent coverage for which it contributes an amount equal to 50 percent of the cost of HMO coverage.\n\n\tThere is no question that defined-contribution plans over time have driven large numbers of employees to medical expense plans with higher degrees of managed care. However, managed care plans historically have provided a broad scope of coverage, including prescription drugs, yet limited the member's payment for these services to relatively modest copayments. In doing so, these plans greatly diminish the motivation of their members to contain costs when they seek services. From a member's viewpoint, the broad array of services is available for only the cost of the copayments. Even as many managed care plans have become less restrictive, copayment levels have often changed little. Such marginal copayments applicable to the wide array of more easily available services may explain, at least in part, the decline in overall personal out-of-pocket payments from nearly 25 percent of health care spending in 1980 to less than 15 percent by the late 1990s (Reference 24 below). However, this is changing somewhat as more employers adopt or revise their medical expense plans so that employees have higher deductibles and larger copayments. In 2010, the American Association of Preferred Provider Organization estimates that 28 million people were enrolled in CDHPs, up from 23 million in 2009 - a 22 percent growth rate (Reference 25 below).\n\nUse of Savings Accounts\nhigh-deductible health plan (HDHP)\n\tNewer types of defined-contribution medical expense plans have features other than just fixed employer contributions. At a minimum, these approaches force employees to make financial decisions involving their health care. Typically, an employer might provide employees with a medical expense plan that has a very high deductible, perhaps as much as $5,000 per year. This type of plan is often referred to as a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The employer also contributes a lower or equal amount, such as $2,500 per year, to some type of savings account from which the employee can make withdrawals to pay medical expenses that the health plan does not cover because of the deductible. These funds are often withdrawn with an electronic payment card (such as a debit card), which has a dollar limit equal to the available savings account balance. The employee can carry forward any unused amount in the account without it affecting the next year's contribution to the account. Such a plan gives the employee an immediate incentive to purchase medical care wisely because, if the amount in the account is exceeded, the employee will have to pay the full cost of medical expenses out of his or her own pocket until the plan's high deductible is satisfied. The plan often incorporates a preferred-provider network of health care professionals. As long as an employee receives medical treatment within the network, any charges that the employee must pay because of the deductible are limited to the amount negotiated with the preferred provider.\n\tEmployers might use this approach for all employees, but many employers make it available as an option to a more traditional medical expense plan. In addition, because of the newness of the approach to providing medical expense coverage, some employers limit these plans to a select group of employees on a trial basis.\n\tThe rationale for using a high-deductible medical expense plan along with a savings account is that significant cost savings can occur for two primary reasons. First, the expensive cost of administering and paying small claims is largely eliminated, as demonstrated by the fact that a major medical policy with a $2,500 deductible can often be purchased for about one-half the cost of a policy with a $250 deductible. Second, employees now have a direct financial incentive to avoid unnecessary care and to seek out the most cost-effective form of treatment.\n\tA small number of employers have used this approach for some time with positive results. Costs have been lowered or have risen less rapidly than would otherwise be expected. Reactions of employees have generally been favorable, but until federal legislation in the late 1990s there was one major drawback-employer contributions to a savings account constituted taxable income to employees.\n\tAs with almost any approach to cost containment, this type of medical expense plan has its critics. They argue that employees will minimize treatment for minor medical expenses and preventive care that would have been covered under a plan without a high deductible. Critics contend that this avoidance of medical care may lead to major expenses that could have been averted or minimized with earlier treatment. However, some types of consumer-directed medical expense plans pay for preventive care without regard to the deductible. Another criticism is that a high-deductible plan tends to favor healthy individuals and those in high tax brackets. A third criticism is that this type of medical expense plan does not focus on the problem of the uninsured. In rebuttal to this criticism, proponents argue that any technique that lowers costs for employers will ultimately benefit everyone and encourage small employers to provide coverage that would have previously been unaffordable. A final criticism is that these plans are just another way of shifting more medical costs to employees.\n\tSome consumer-directed medical expense plans using the savings-account approach have been designed so that employer decisions about specific benefit plans are eliminated, or at least minimized. Some employers view this as a way of minimizing their legal exposure for health care decisions because a certain level of responsibility is transferred back to employees and health care providers. Under such a plan, an employee can use an employer contribution (along with any additionally needed employee contribution) to shop at some type of \"health care supermarket,\" where many different types of medical expense plans are available. These plans are often required to provide detailed information about their operations so that consumers can make more informed decisions when selecting a medical expense plan. An insurer or some type of Internet marketer may offer these plans, and the employer may or may not be involved in the selection of the supermarket that an employee uses. Most consumer-directed medical expense plans that use the savings-account approach, however, only make a single medical expense plan available to employees.\n\tTwo tax-favored approaches use savings accounts:\n\u2022 health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs)\n\u2022 health savings accounts (HSAs)\n\tHRAs can only be established by employers for their employees. HSAs can be established by either employers or individuals. Archer MSAs are also briefly mentioned. However, new Archer MSAs can no longer be established, but some employees may still have them.\n\tIt is common for employers to establish flexible spending accounts (FSAs) so that their employees can elect before-tax salary reductions to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses. There are those who argue that FSAs are a form of consumer-directed health plan. However, they can be viewed primarily as an aspect of a cafeteria plan that provides federal income tax benefits to employees when they are properly used.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n24.

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Provider Reimbursement Approaches\n\n\tProvider reimbursement approaches include fee-for service, capitation, and health care purchasing cooperatives and coalitions.\n \nFee-for-Service\n\tUnder this payment method, health care providers charge separately each time services for care are rendered. This is a common reimbursement method under traditional indemnity plans. Providers commonly set their own charge and are paid accordingly. Sometimes, insurers negotiate a fee schedule that establishes the maximum amount the plan will pay for any given medical procedure or service. Fee-for-service has been the most common provider reimbursement approach for the traditional prepayment, indemnity, and comprehensive plan designs. Preferred provider options may pay a fee for services, but this fee typically would be a negotiated and discounted fee.\n\nCapitation\n\tUnder capitation, providers are paid a set amount (generally monthly for primary care providers (PCPs)) for each plan participant, regardless of the number of visits or services provided.\n\tCapitation payment methods are used extensively by HMOs. This form of payment shifts some risk to the medical provider, who accepts the capitation amount, assuming the increased enrollment will level out the risks. Some plans reimburse PCPs and certain specialists using capitation, and have a fee schedule for other medical specialists.\n\nOther Provider Reimbursement Approaches\n\tSome employers have banded together into purchasing cooperatives to have greater health care buying power in the marketplace. Such an arrangement is used to gain favorable pricing from medical providers because of the large volume of business that can be supplied. This means of purchasing health care can be particularly attractive to a small employer who would not be able to procure the same discount on services that a large employer could. In some ways, the insurance company or managed care provider plays this role for smaller groups. However, the emergence of health care purchasing cooperatives provides another alternative for employers to negotiate pricing with medical providers.\n"

Since then however, ERISA has been amended repeatedly to add mandatory provisions for different types of benefit plans.\n\tERISA doesn't regulate all employee benefits, just those that are part of an \"employee benefit plan\" (which doesn't have to be a written document). For ERISA to apply, the benefit has to be on ERISA's list of covered benefits, there has to be a plan, program, or fund to provide the benefit and the benefit has to apply to at least one employee.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 5 - Basics of ERISA - The Basics of ERISA for Welfare Benefit Plans\n    The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, generally referred to as ERISA, is the cornerstone of employee benefits law. ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (see KB-1 Topic 200) are the two key laws that govern welfare benefit plans.\n\nPointer: FAST FACTS on ERISA\n  ERISA welfare benefit plans must comply with ERISA's rules on reporting and disclosure and what a plan fiduciary can and cannot do, along with related prohibited transaction rules. These plans must also establish benefit claims procedures.\n  Employers and employee organizations (such as labor unions) that offer welfare plans for employees are subject to these ERISA rules.\n  Except for state insurance laws and state laws relating to multiple employee welfare arrangements (MEWAs), ERISA preempts state law.\n\nEmployee benefit plans\n  In general, ERISA applies to \"employee benefit plans,\" subject to a list of exceptions. Employee benefit plans can be broadly classified into two groups: employee welfare benefit plans and employee pension benefit plans.\n  Some parts of ERISA (in Title I) apply to both welfare benefit plans and pension plans. Many others (parts of Title I and all of Titles II-IV) apply only to pension plans. The focus of this chapter, and indeed, of this book, is solely on employee welfare benefit plans.\n\nERISA requirements for welfare benefit plans\nAs to welfare benefit plans, what does ERISA require? These plans must meet the ERISA rules on:\n1. Reporting and disclosure-both to the Labor Department and to participants (see KB-1 Topic 65-140);\n2. Fiduciary responsibility (see KB-1 Topic 30);\n3. Prohibited transactions (see KB-1 Topic 40); and\n4. Benefit claims procedures (see KB-1 Topic 45).\n \nPointer: Although ERISA has strict vesting, funding, and participation rules that apply to pension plans, these rules do not apply to welfare benefit plans. This means that employers may amend or terminate their welfare benefit plans if they have clearly reserved the right to do so. In addition, employers may fund these plans on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis out of their general assets.\n\nWhich entities are subject to ERISA?\n    ERISA applies to employers and to employee organizations that offer ERISA welfare benefit plans.\n    Employee organizations. An \"employee organization\" is a labor union or any other organization which exists (either in whole or in part) to deal with employers concerning an employee benefit plan or other matters incidental to the employment relationship.\n\nWhich plans are ERISA welfare plans?\n    A wide variety of welfare plans come under ERISA (see KB-1 Topic 10). Plans providing medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits for sickness, accident, disability, or death are only some of the types of plans subject to ERISA\n \nPlan must be in writing\n    Every plan that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility rules must be established and maintained under a written instrument. This written document must provide for one or more named fiduciaries who have authority to control the plan's operation and administration. (Reference 1 below) A \"named fiduciary\" is one who is either named in the written plan instrument or who, in accordance with plan procedures, is identified as a plan fiduciary.\n\nFor more information...\n\n    A discussion on determining which types of welfare benefit plans are subject to ERISA is located at r 10. A checklist of factors is available at KB-1 Topic 13.\nThe reporting rules of ERISA are addressed beginning at KB-1 Topic 65. \nERISA's disclosure rules are covered beginning at KB-1 Topic 100.\n    The fiduciary rules of ERISA are addressed beginning at KB-1 Topic 25, while related prohibited transaction rules can be found at KB-1 Topic 40.\nERISA rules governing benefit claims are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-406, hereinafter referred to as ERISA), ERISA Sec. 402(a).\n \n"

                    "text": "KB-4 - Chapter 1 - Introduction - 1.04 History and Purposes of ERISA (Reference 9 below)\n\n                 ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (Reference 10 below) was signed into law by President Gerald Ford on September 2, 1974 (Reference 11 below) It was the culmination ofmore than a decade of Congressional hearings, reports, studies, and deliberations on the weaknesses and problems with existing state and federal regulation of employee benefit plans. (Reference 12 below)\n\n\n[A] Pre-ERISA Regulation of Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPrior to the enactment of ERISA, employee benefit plans were impacted by three types of federal laws:\n(1) federal income tax laws,\n(2) federal labor laws, and\n(3) the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act. (Reference 13 below)\n\nIn addition, employee benefit plans were subject to some state law regulation.\nNevertheless, substantive regulation of employee benefit plans was relatively limited.\n\n\n[1] Federal Income Tax Law\n             Federal income tax law encouraged the creation of \u201cqualified\u201d pension plans by providing for favorable income tax treatment of such plans. (Reference 14 below) Tax law, however, did not impose much substantive regulation on qualified plans. For example, it did not require advance fimding ofbenefits nor did it require that benefits become vested, that is, non\u0002forfeitable, after a certain period oftime. Federal tax law was most concerned with targeting the tax subsidy and ensuring that lower-income employees as well as higher-income employees participated in and benefited from qualified pension plans.\n\n\n[2] Federal Labor Law\n             The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), (Reference 15 below) enacted in 1935, established a frame\u0002work for the bargaining of pension and welfare benefits. (Reference 16 below) In 1947, the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) (Reference 17 below) amended the NLRA to require that pension and welfare benefit plans subject to the Act be administered by joint trustee fiduciaries representing both employees and employers. (Reference 18 below) The LMRA also required that plans subject to the Act be written and operated for the \u201cexclusive benefit\u201d of the employees. (Reference 19 below) Case law established principles of fiduciary responsibility governing plan administration and the investment of plan assets. (Reference 20 below) Federal labor law, however, only regulated plans established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements (Reference 21 below) and was not enforced uniformly. (Reference 22 below) For example, the Department ofJustice only enforced the labor law pro\u0002visions when there was evidence of criminality, and participants and beneficiaries were often reluctant to enforce the law because of the fear of retaliation. (Reference 23 below)\n\n\n[3] Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act\n             In 1958, Congress enacted the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act (WPPDA), (Reference 24 below) the first federal statute aimed directly and exclusively at private employee benefit plans. The WPPDA did not impose any substantive regulations on employee benefit plans. Instead, it sought to regulate employee benefit plans through reporting and disclosure requirements. (Reference 25 below) The theory behind the WPPDA was that \u201cfull disclosure to plan participants and beneficiaries ofthe provisions oftheir plan and its financial operations would deter abuse (\u2018sunlight being the best disinfectant\u2019) and would enable [participants and beneficiaries] to police the plans themselves without requiring greater Government regulations or interference.\u201d (Reference 26 below) The WPPDA expressly preserved state authority to regulate employee benefit plans. (Reference 27 below)\n\n\n[4] State Law\n             When Congress enacted the WPPDA, six states had already enacted statutes specifically directed at employee benefit plans. (Reference 28 below) For the most part, however, employee benefit plans were regulated by state common law prior to the enactment of ERISA, and little of that common law was directed specifically at employee benefit plans. (Reference 29 below)\n\n\n[B] Failure of Pre-ERISA Law to Protect Plan Participants and Beneficiaries\n              By the 1960s, a consensus was beginning to form that state and federal law did not provide sufficient protection to employee benefit plan participants and beneficiaries. (Reference 30 below) \n\n              The failure of pre-ERISA law to protect plan participants and beneficiaries was  most famously\u2014and starkly\u2014illustrated by the closing ofthe Studebaker automobile plant in December 1963. (Reference 31 below) Prior to the enactment of ERISA, neither federal nor state law required that pension plans be prefunded, that is, the law did not require that contributions be made during each employee\u2019s working life to ensure that the full cost ofthe benefit promised to the employee was funded when the employee retired. (Reference 32 below) Thus, when the Studebaker plant closed, and its pension plan terminated, the Studebaker\u2019s plan\u2019s liabilities (that is, its promised benefits) exceeded its assets by $15 million. (Reference 33 below)  As a result, the terminated plan was unable to pay all of the plan participants all ofthe benefits that they had been promised. Specifically, 4,000 vested employees between the ages of 40 and 60 received 15% of their promised benefits while 2,900  workers under the age of 40 received no benefits whatsoever (regardless of whether their benefits were vested). (Reference 34 below) \n\n              The Studebaker plant closing clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the law to ensure proper plan funding. Inadequate funding, however, was not the only risk that plan participants faced. Prior to the enactment of ERISA, some pension plans did not provide for the vesting of benefits. (Reference 35 below)  Employers ofsuch plans were free to terminate their plans at any time, and employees had no enforceable rights to their promised pensions. Moreover, plans that did provide for the vesting of benefits could impose age limits and lengthy service requirements. According to one account, prior to ERISA, fewer than 10% of plan participants ever attained benefit eligibility because of lengthy service requirements and numerous disqualification provisions. (Reference 36 below) \n\n              In addition to concerns about inadequate funding and vesting of pension plans, \u201cCongress was also concerned that large amounts of money in the hands of plan managers created a temptation for self-dealing and improper handling of these funds.\u201d (Reference 37 below)  In the 1950s, a special Senate committee was established to investigate improper practices with respect to employee benefit plans. The investigations uncovered \u201call manner of abuses, ranging from ineptness and lack of know-how to outright looting of benefit funds and corrupt administration.\u201d (Reference 38 below) For example, in 1965, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations discovered that George Barasch, the founder of two New Jersey unions, had managed to manipulate and divert the\nfunds ofthe unions\u2019 employee benefit plans so as to make himself a prospective multimillionaire (Reference 39 below)  He was both trustee of the plans and owner of a benefit consulting firm which operated the plans and collected huge consulting fees on his behalf. (Reference 37 below)  Existing law did not adequately protect against this behavior. (Reference 41 below) \n\n\n[C] Purposes of ERISA\n              In section 2 of ERISA, (Reference 42 below) Congress set forth, at length, its findings and declaration of policy in enacting ERISA.\n\n              Congress identified four principal problems with employee benefit plans: (1) in\u0002adequate disclosure of plan information, (2) inadequate safeguards against inappropriate plan administration, (Reference 43 below) (3) the widespread loss of anticipated retirement benefits due to the lack of vesting provisions, and (4) the inability of plans to provide promised benefits due to inadequate funding. (Reference 44 below)\n\n              Congress then identified six ways in which ERISA would address those problems: (1) by imposing reporting and disclosure requirements, (2) by establishing fiduciary standards, (3) by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to courts, (4) by imposing vesting standards, (5) by imposing minimum funding standards, and (6) by requiring plan termination insurance. (Reference 45 below)\n\n               On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court has referred to Congress\u2019 purposes in enacting ERISA. For example, in one early case, Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., (Reference 46 below) the Court declared, \u201cone of Congress\u2019 central purposes in enacting [ERISA] was to prevent the \u2018great personal tragedy\u2019 suffered by employees whose vested benefits are not paid when pension plans are terminated.\u201d (Reference 47 below) In Boggs v. Boggs, (Reference 48 below) the Court announced that \u201c[t]he principal object ofthe statute is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries.\u201d (Reference 49 below)\n\n               Not all of ERISA\u2019s provisions, however, protect and favor plan participants. For example, ERISA expressly preempts state laws that relate to employee benefit plans. To the extent that state law provides employees with greater protections than does\nERISA, ERISA preemption does not protect or favor plan participants. Instead, ERISA preemption favors plan sponsors and administrators by promoting uniformity oflaw and reducing the administrative burden of complying with multiple laws. ERISA\u2019s legislative history makes clear that not only did Congress intend to protect plan participants in enacting ERISA, but it also sought to encourage employers to voluntarily establish employee benefit plans and thus tried not to place undue burdens on plans\nwhen enacting ERISA. (Reference 50 below)\n\n               Accordingly, ERISA may be said to have conflicting purposes. (Reference 51 below) Indeed, in Varity Corp. V. Howe, (Reference 52 below) the Court noted that in interpreting ERISA, \u201ccourts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes, such as Congress\u2019 desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place.

If an employee dies, becomes incapacitated, loses his or her job or suffers a reduction in work hours, health care coverage can be extended for up to 18 or 36 months, depending on circumstances. \n\n                       The cost of health insurance provided under COBRA is usually high, because the recipient pays the entire premium including the portion that was being paid by the employer. In that sense, COBRA coverage is primarily a stop-gap until less expensive health insurance can be found.\n\n                       To qualify for COBRA coverage, an employee has to have been enrolled in a company-sponsored group health insurance plan on the day before the qualifying event (loss of job, reduced hours, etc.) occurs and the insurance plan must have been in effect on more than 50% of the employer's typical business days during the previous calendar year. ln addition, the employer must still be offering existing employees a group health plan; if the employer stops offering health coverage or goes out of business or drops below 20 employees the employee seeking COBRA coverage may no longer be eligible for extended insurance benefits.\n\n                       Even small employers with less than 20 employees may be required to provide extended insurance coverage to employees who have suffered a qualifying event. Many states have laws similar to COBRA. These \"mini-COBRA\" laws generally apply to employers of all sizes, including those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n"

These requirements generally apply to all employers with 20 or more employees.\n\tIn general, each \"qualified beneficiary\" who would otherwise lose health care coverage caused by a \"qualifying event\" must be given the opportunity to continue coverage during the applicable \"continuation periods.\" A \"qualified beneficiary\" is the employee, the employee's spouse and the employee's children if they were covered by the plan immediately prior to the qualifying event. A \"qualifying event\" is\n\u25a0 Death of the employee\n\u25a0 Employee's termination of employment (except for gross misconduct)\n\u25a0 A reduction in the employee's hours\n\u25a0 Divorce or legal separation of the employee and his or her spouse\n\u25a0 Eligibility for Medicare coverage\n\u25a0 Cessation of a child's eligibility as a dependent\n\u25a0 Reduction, loss or subsequent elimination of retiree medical coverage one year before or after the beginning of an employer's bankruptcy proceeding\n\tThe \"continuation period\" is 18 months if the qualifying event is termination of employment or reduction in hours; otherwise, it is 36 months. In addition, coverage must be available for up to 29 months for individuals determined by Social Security to be disabled at the time of the employee's termination of employment or reduction in hours.\n\tThe coverage provided must be identical to the coverage provided for active employees who have not had a qualifying event. The election period during which a qualified beneficiary may elect to continue coverage is the 60-day period following the day coverage is terminated or the day notification of eligibility is received, whichever is later. The beneficiary may be charged up to 102 percent of the cost of the coverage. This limit is raised to 150 percent of the cost for certain disabled individuals for months 19 through 29. A plan administrator who fails to give proper notice may be subject to a penalty of up to $110 a day for each day of the failure.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1400 - Continuation Coverage COBRA - The Basics of COBRA\n \n\tUnder federal law, group health plans are required to offer continuation of group health coverage to certain former employees and their families upon the occurrence of certain \"qualifying events.\" This requirement is generally called COBRA because it was first enacted as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.(Reference 1 below)\n\n\tPointer: FAST FACTS about COBRA\n\t\tCOBRA requires employers offering group health plans to offer continuation health coverage to certain former employees and their families upon the occur\u00ad rence of job loss or other qualifying events.\n\t\tCOBRA coverage may last 18, 29 or 36 months, depending on the type of qualifying event that triggered the COBRA coverage. Employers are not required to bear the cost of continuation coverage. The group health plan may require the covered employee to pay a premium for continuation coverage. The premium cannot be more than 102 percent of the cost of the plan for similarly situated beneficiaries who have not experienced a qualifying event.\n\nCovered health plans\n\n\tCOBRA applies to all group health plans except:\n\t\t\u25a1 plans maintained by small employers (i.e., those with fewer than 20 employees);\n\t\t\u25a1 plans maintained for governmental employees; and\n\t\t\u25a1 plans established by churches.\n\nGroup health plans\n\tIn general, a group health plan is an employer-maintained plan that provides health care to the employer's employees, former employees, or the families of such employees or former employees. This is true whether the coverage is provided directly or through insurance, reimbursement or otherwise.\n\nQualified beneficiaries\n\tAn employee covered under an employer's group health plan is a qualified beneficiary only in situations where the qualifying event is a termination (other than for gross misconduct) or a reduction in working hours.\n\tAlso, an individual is a qualified beneficiary if, on the day before a qualifying event, that person is covered under the employer's plan and is the spouse, a dependent child of the covered employee, or a child born, adopted by or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of COBRA coverage.\n\tRetirees, independent contractors, directors of a corporation, and partners of a partnership are considered \"covered employees\" if they are covered under the group health plan on the day before a qualifying event.\n\nQualifying events\n\tQualified beneficiaries who lose coverage under a group health plan as the result of a qualifying event are entitled to elect continuation coverage. Qualifying events are certain types of events that would cause the qualified beneficiary to lose health coverage.\n\n\tThe following can be qualifying events:\n\t\t\u25a1 voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for any reason other than gross misconduct;\n\t\t\u25a1 reduction in the number of hours of employment;\n\t\t\u25a1 death of the covered employee;\n\t\t\u25a1 divorce or legal separation of the covered employee from the employee's spouse;\n\t\t\u25a1 entitlement to Medicare for the covered employee;\n\t\t\u25a1 loss of dependent child status under the plan rules; and\n\t\t\u25a1 bankruptcy proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code with respect to an employer from whose employment a covered employee retired at any time.\n\nLoss of coverage\n\tRemember, any of the above events is a qualifying event only if it results in a loss of coverage to the qualified beneficiary. To lose coverage means to cease to be covered under the same terms and conditions in effect immediately before the qualifying event. This includes the premium amount paid for the coverage. Thus, an increase in an employee paid premium or contribution for coverage that results from a qualifying event is considered a loss of coverage.\n\nNotice\n\tCOBRA prescribes notification responsibilities that apply to employers, plan administrators, and, in certain instances, covered employees and qualified beneficiaries. (In many cases, the employer and plan administrator will be the same person or entity.)\n\tInitial notice. When an employee becomes covered under a group health plan, the plan must furnish to the employee and the employee's spouse initial written notice of their rights under COBRA\n\tElection notice. The second round of notice-giving is triggered when a qualifying event occurs. Employers must notify plan administrators within 30 days of a covered employee's death, termination, reduction in hours of employment, entitlement to Medicare or initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by an employer. Plan administrators must provide a notice of the right to elect continuation coverage to each qualified beneficiary within 14 days of receiving notice that a qualifying event occurred. A plan administrator may satisfy this responsibility by sending the notice by first-class mail to the last known address of the beneficiary. Often this can be sent simultaneously with certifications of creditable coverage required by HIPAA\n\tEmployee's notice duties. The covered employee or qualified beneficiary must notify the plan administrator within 60 days of a divorce or legal separation or the date on which a child ceases to be a dependent under plan rules.\n\nElections\n\tThe beneficiary, or a representative of the beneficiary, must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of the later of (1) the date coverage is lost, or (2) the date that notice to the qualified beneficiary is sent.\n\tAn election by a qualified beneficiary is considered made on the date that it is sent.\n \nScope of COBRA coverage\n\tContinuation coverage must be identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries. This usually means the same coverage that the qualified beneficiary had on the day before the qualifying event. COBRA beneficiaries may change coverage during periods of open enrollment offered by the plan in the same way that employees may change coverage.\n\nDuration of coverage\n\tCOBRA generally provides a maximum continuation period of 18 months. If a qualified beneficiary becomes disabled within 60 days of COBRA coverage, the period can be extended to 29 months. Also, if certain qualifying events occur during the original 18 months of COBRA coverage, qualified beneficiaries become entitled to receive 36 months of continuation coverage. A qualified beneficiary's maximum continuation period begins on the date of the qualifying event, and in no case can the maximum period exceed 36 months.\n\nPaying for COBRA\n\tEmployers may require qualified beneficiaries to pay the entire premium for coverage, plus a 2% administrative charge, for a total of 102% of the cost of coverage to the plan for similarly situated individuals still covered under the plan.\n\tFor disabled qualified beneficiaries receiving either 29 months of coverage or 36 months of coverage due to a secondary qualifying event that occurs during the disability extension period, premiums may be increased after 18 months to 150% of the plan's total cost of coverage. If the disabled individual is part of the same coverage group as family members who are not disabled qualified beneficiaries, the family members may also be charged 150% after 18 months.\n\nMergers and acquisitions\n\tIRS regulations provide guidance on determining COBRA liabilities of buyers and sellers of corporate stock and corporate assets and permit buyers and sellers to reallocate and carry out those liabilities by agreement. (See ,KB-1 Topic 1502 for more on COBRA obligations in a business reorganization).\n\nState law treatment\n\tOver 35 states have enacted so-called mini-COBRA laws. These state laws often require small employers to offer continuation coverage. Some state laws require all employers to offer continuation coverage that is more generous than what is required by federal law.\n\tPointer: Impact of health reform on COBRA rights. The Affordable Care Act did not change employees' rights to continuation coverage under COBRA, or employers' responsibilities to provide general and election notices to eligible employees. However, with the opening of enrollment via the exchanges in October 2013, workers who have lost employer-provided coverage now have additional options for coverage. Options available on the exchanges may be less expensive than COBRA coverage, especially for workers eligible for premium tax credits. As a result, some speculate that COBRA participation rates, never very high, will grow smaller in the coming years. In addition, note that COBRA coverage is \"minimum essential coverage\" for purposes of the ACA shared responsibility rules and other provisions.\n\nFor more information ...\n\tA quick reference to frequently asked questions and answers about COBRA is located at ,KB-1 Topic 14,140 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n\tCOBRA GUIDE is a complete source for COBRA-related information.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1 Continuation coverage requirements for group health plans enacted by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L.99-272) are located at Code Sec. 4980B; IRS Reg.\u00a7 \u00a7 54.4980B-54.4980B-10; ERISA Secs. 601- 608.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - The Governmental Environment for Group Benefits - Health Care Reform\n\nOverview of Health Care Reform\n\nAffordable Care Act (ACA)\n\n\tOn March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed. It was followed by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act on March 30, 2010. Together, these two laws are referred to as the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\tThe Affordable Care Act directs a massive overhaul of the health care system in the United States. Changes are being implemented through changes in the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Public Health Service Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, ERISA, and HIPAA among others. There are no changes to COBRA included in ACA.\n\n\tThe Affordable Care Act has four main goals:\n\n\t\t\u25a0 To increase access to preventive care \n\t\t\u25a0 To increase access to wellness care \n\t\t\u25a0 To create transparency for consumers\n\t\t\u25a0 To eliminate waste and fraud within the healthcare system\n\n\tThere are several federal agencies responsible for monitoring the implementation of ACA and ensuring compliance with the laws. They include the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service. There are still many areas of ACA that require additional guidelines and clarification before full implementation can occur. Some mandates and provisions have been delayed or removed from the original implementation schedule. There have also been several lawsuits filed by state governments to challenge some mandates of the law.\n\nEssential Health Benefits\n\n\tACA introduced the concept of an essential health benefit essential health benefit and minimum essential coverage.\n\nMinimum\tEssential Coverage\n\n\tEssential health benefits include ambulatory patient services, hospitalization, emergency services, coverage maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse disorders including behavioral health treatment,\nrehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventive care and wellness services, chronic disease management, pediatric services including oral and vision care, and prescription drugs. The Department of Health and Human Services reserves the right to add benefits to the definition. Minimum essential coverage is coverage that is offered under individual market policies, job-based coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, and certain other coverages.\n\n\tThe Affordable Care Act increases the access to affordable health care provided through individual coverage, group health coverage, Medicaid, Medicare, and the state health benefit exchanges. The definition of a group health plan is an employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in ERISA) to the extent that the plan provides medical care (including items and services paid for as medical care) to employees or their dependents (as defined under the terms of the plan) directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise. The changes created by ACA may raise both the cost factors and administrative burdens for employers, insurance companies, and health plans.\n\n\tIt is possible that the final implementation of the Affordable Care Act will look different than the proposed design today. As of the publication date of this book, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the constitutionality of the Act. The court's ruling is expected to be released in mid-2012.\n\n\tThe official government website for additional information on healthcare reform is healthcare.gov.\n\nTime Line for Implementation\n\n\tThe Affordable Care Act is a massive change in the way that Americans will access and receive health care. The act's mandates will be phased in over the next several years. The table below is a schedule of the main mandates which have not been repealed or indefinitely delayed as of the publication date of this book.\n\nYear\t\tChanges to be Implemented\n2010\t\t.

Large group plans begin participating in the state health benefit exchanges\n\nSummary of Affordable Care Act Changes\n\n\tACA mandates are numerous and some are somewhat complicated. The following are high level summaries of the main mandates.\n\n\tDependent coverage to age 26 -\teffective September 23, 2010. Applies to both group and individual coverages. Any dependents who were dropped from coverage due to aging out of eligibility must be re-enrolled with no medical underwriting. To continue to be covered as an adult dependent there is no requirement for tax dependence, residency, student status, marital status, employment status, or eligibility for other coverage.\n\nEarly Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP)\n\n\tEarly Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) - effective June 1, 2010. The federal government assigned $5 billion to reimburse employer plans that provide health benefits to early retirees for up to 80 percent of eligible health claims exceeding $15,000, but less than $90,000. The maximum reimbursement is $60,000 per person. These amounts are indexed. (For plans on or after 10-1-11, the threshold is $16,000 and the limit is $93,000.) Employers must apply to participate in this program. The federal government has suspended enrollment in the program to new employers temporarily due to the large number of claims being submitted. When the federal funds are depleted, the program is scheduled to terminate. As of the publication date of this book, the program has almost depleted the $5 billion of allocated funds.\n\n\tHigh risk pools - effective June 1, 2010. Federal support of state high risk pools was continued and expanded. These pools will be eliminated in 2014 when the state health benefit exchanges are established.\n\n\tPatient protections - effective September 23, 2010. Health coverages were expanded to include additional emergency services, OB/GYN services and in 2012, changes in health plan clinical trials.\n\n\tPreexisting condition exclusion prohibition for persons under age 19 - effective September 23, 2010. Persons who were declined for coverage under group or individual plans due to preexisting conditions must be enrolled with no underwriting.\n\n\tProhibition of lifetime maximum limits on essential health benefits - effective September 23, 2010. Anyone who exceeded an established maximum lifetime limit can be reenrolled. There are no waivers allowed for the prohibition of lifetime maximum limits.\n\n\tAnnual restrictions - effective September 23, 2010. Annual limits on essential health benefits will be phased out until 2014 when they will be totally removed. For plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2011, a plan can have $1.25 million as an annual limit. The annual maximum is $2 million for plan years beginning September 23, 2012 until January 1, 2014 at which time the annual maximum limits are prohibited. Under certain circumstances, plans that were offered prior to September 23, 2010 may obtain annual renewable waivers for the annual limit requirement restrictions until January 1, 2014.\n\n\tRescission prohibition - effective September 23, 2010. Retroactive rescissions due to unintentional errors on the application information are prohibited. Rescission can still occur due to fraud, intentional misrepresentations, etc. Retroactive terminations are allowed for (1) course of business reporting delays such as an employer reconciliation of employee eligibility and (2) failure to notify a plan administrator of a divorce. For other reasons, the rescission is prospective only.\n\n\tAutomatic enrollment - effective 2010. Employers with 200 or more employees must enroll all employees on their health care plan. There is more guidance required from the Department of Health and Human Services to determine which plan will be the designated plan for automatic enrollment in multiple plan offerings, etc.\n\n\tPreventive care cost-sharing elimination - effective September 23, 2010. Preventive care and wellness cost-sharing provisions are prohibited.\n\n\tSmall business tax credit - effective in 2010. A tax credit of up to 35 percent of the employer's cost of providing eligible health coverage for employees is available to small businesses. In 2014, the tax credit will increase to 50 percent. There is a modified credit for nonprofit small businesses.\n\n\tExpansion of Medicaid eligibility to adults without children with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level - effective April 1, 2010. The requirement to have dependent children for eligibility for Medicaid coverage has been removed. Federal funding has also been adjusted in that from 2014 to 2016, newly eligible adults will be funded 100 percent by the federal government. The federal funding will be phased downward to 90 percent for 2020 and thereafter.\n\nChildren Health Insurance Plan (CHIP)\n\n\tCHIP and children in Medicaid -\teffective immediately. CHIP funding has been extended through 2015 when states will receive additional funds for the program up to 100 percent.\n\n\tMedicare changes - effective January 1, 2010. The Affordable Care Act established a $250 rebate to beneficiaries who reached the Part D gap in 2010. The Part D coinsurance rate for the coverage gap will be reduced from 100 percent to 25 percent by 2020.\n\n\tQualified health care account tax increase - effective January 1, 2011. Qualified health care account funds used for nonqualified/ineligible medical expenses will generate a 20 percent tax penalty which is an increase over the 10-15 percent tax penalty previously used.\n\n\tOTC reimbursement rules for medical flexible spending accounts and other qualified health care accounts - effective January 1, 2011. Over the counter medications purchased without a prescription are no longer eligible for reimbursement through an employee's qualified health care account. OTC items such as crutches are still eligible.\n\nMedical Loss Ratio (MLR)\n\n\tMedical loss ratio regulations - effective January 1, 2011. This mandate states that for large groups, the insurance carriers or health plans are required to spend 85 percent of the premium on medical care services. For the small group and individual products, they are required to spend 80 percent of the premium on medical care services. If this medical loss ratio is not met, the insurance carrier or health plan must rebate the excess to the purchaser. There can be exceptions granted for individual plans only by the Department of Health and Human Services in areas where the medical loss ratio requirements are causing health plans to exit the marketplace. There have been some exceptions granted.\n\n\tSmall business grants -\teffective January 1, 2011. Grants will be available for small businesses to use to create wellness programs for their employees.\n\n\tMedicare changes - effective January 1, 2011. ACA created adjustments in the payments received by issuers of Medicare Advantage products. It also created a payment bonus program based on receiving four or more stars out of a current five star quality rating system for Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n\tFour-page summary of benefits -\teffective January 1, 2012. This summary will be required to be distributed to all plan participants as part of the communication transparency for consumers. As of the publication date of this book, the Department of Health and Human Services is still finalizing the guidelines regarding the content of this document so this mandate has been temporarily delayed.\n\n\tHealth care flexible spending account cap of $2,500 - effective January 1, 2013. The $2,500 cap is per family per year.\n\n\tNotice of exchanges distributed - by March 31, 2013. This notice discloses what the state health benefit exchanges are, what is being offered through the exchanges in that state, what the employer's plan is offering and what the consequences are of choosing coverage between the employer plan and the exchanges. It is an educational tool for those participating in employer-sponsored plans.\n\n\tHIPAA regulation changes - phased in between 2013 and 2016. HIPAA changes will streamline medical records by creating uniform medical codes and definitions that can be transmitted in the standardized electronic data interface formats.\n\n\tIncrease in medical income tax deduction threshold - effective January 1, 2013. The threshold for a federal income tax deduction for medical expenses will increase from 7.5 percent to 10 percent.\n\n\tFair premiums -\teffective January 1, 2014. The state departments of insurance and the Department of Health and Human Services will jointly monitor and approve insurance carrier rate increases for medical coverage.\n\n\tReporting requirements - effective January 1, 2014. Reports will be required from entities who provide medical coverage. These reports will include information on what the benefits are worth, what the carrier is spending on the cost of providing services versus marketing costs and profit, etc. The Department of Health and Human Services and the state departments of insurance will receive the reports and post them on a public website where consumers can view the information. The website will also provide information regarding claims payouts for the carriers, the number of enrollees in plans, geographic locations where the company does business, and if the carrier is participating in an exchange and what the exchange plans are.\n\nState Health Benefit Exchanges \n\nNavigator\n\n\tState health benefit exchanges established - effective January 1, 2014. The exchanges will function as an insurance marketplace in each state for individuals and small employers in 2014. Small group may be defined as 50 and under employees or 100 and under employees at the state's discretion. There will be four levels of plans offered: bronze (60 percent coinsurance), silver (70 percent coinsurance), gold (80 percent coinsurance), and platinum (90 percent coinsurance). Participants may choose the desired level of benefits. A new role called a navigator will advise employers and individuals regarding plans and coverages available in the exchanges. As the mandate is currently written, a broker cannot act as a navigator in the exchange and also write business directly with an insurance carrier and be paid for both. Insurance carriers and health plans must offer coverage for minimum essential coverages in order to participate in the exchange. Insurance carriers and health plans must offer the same pricing structure for similar benefits within the exchange and directly to consumers. There will be premium subsidies available for those persons who qualify.\n\nIndividual Mandate\n\n\tIndividual mandate - effective January 1, 2014. This mandate says that everyone will be required to obtain health care coverage or pay a penalty tax ($95 in 2014). The tax will increase over time. This mandate is being challenged as unconstitutional in several states and is scheduled to be reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n\nPlay-or-Pay Tax\n\n\tPlay-or-pay tax - effective January 1, 2014. Large employers will be required to pay a tax if\n\n\t\t1. they do not offer at least a minimum level of benefits to their employees, or\n\t\t2. they offer coverage but that coverage is deemed to be unaffordable and the employee(s) obtains coverage through an exchange\n\n\tThe tax will be up to $2,000 per year per employee. There are specified formulas to determine the affordability of the employer's coverage. If affordable health care is offered and the employee still chooses to purchase coverage through an exchange, the employer will not be required to pay the tax penalty.\n\n\tPreexisting condition exclusion total prohibition - effective January 1, 2014. This mandate expands the preexisting condition exclusion established in 2010 to children under age 19 to all persons regardless of age. There will be no more medical underwriting for health care coverage. Underwriting may be continued based on age, gender, geographic location, and smoking status only. Premiums cannot be rated up for medical reasons.\n\n\tAnnual limits prohibition - effective January 1, 2014. Annual limits on essential health benefits will be eliminated totally.\n\n\tWaiting period limits -\teffective January 1, 2014. The waiting period for benefit eligibility cannot exceed 90 days.\n\n\tAvailability and renewability requirements - effective January 1, 2014. The small employer market is required to accept any small business who wants coverage and also renew that coverage. There is more guidance being developed by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\tClinical trial coverage - effective January 1, 2014. There will be changes regarding the clinical trials performed outside of a provider network. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is issuing additional guidelines regarding this mandate.\n\n\tComprehensive coverage - effective January 1, 2014. If an insurance carrier or health plan does not offer at least minimum essential coverages, it will not be allowed to offer health benefit coverage through an exchange, etc.\n\n\tMedicare changes - effective January 1, 2014. Medicare Advantage plans must meet a medical loss ratio level of less than 85 percent. If they do not for two consecutive years, the plan enrollment will be suspended for three years.\n\n\tIf the medical loss ratio is less than 85 percent for five consecutive years, the Medicare Advantage plan will be terminated by CMS.\n\n\tLarge group participation in the exchanges - effective January 1, 2017. Large groups can begin purchasing coverage through the state health benefit exchanges.\n\n\tThese are the mandates that are scheduled for Affordable Care Act implementation as of the revision date of this book. There have been mandates removed from the schedule. The latest of these is the CLASS Act which would have provided long-term care type of coverage funded through employee payroll deductions. The long-term financial solvency of this program was not confirmed.\n\nGrandfathered Plans\n\n\tIf medical coverage existed on March 23, 2010, ACA offered exemptions from compliance with some of the new mandates. This allowed consumers to keep most of the coverage they already had before the law was enacted.\n\n\tAll health plans including grandfathered plans must:\n\n\t\t\u2022 remove lifetime dollar limits to key health benefits\n\t\t\u2022 not rescind coverage due to an unintentional application error have a new employee waiting period of 90 days or less\n\t\t\u2022 remove the preexisting condition exclusion on those under age 19\n\t\t\u2022 provide a four-page summary of benefits and coverage to participants\n\t\t\u2022 meet the medical loss ratio requirements\n\t\t\u2022 nextend dependent coverage to age 26 \n\n\tGrandfathered plans are not required to:\n\n\t\t\u2022 provide recommended preventive services with no cost-sharing\n\t\t\u2022 limit overall cost-sharing for essential health benefits provide essential health benefits\n\t\t\u2022 offer new protections for consumers appealing claims and coverage denials\n\t\t\u2022 protect the choice of health care providers and access to emergency care\n\t\t\u2022 prohibit using health status in setting premium rates\n\n\tIn addition, grandfathered individual health plans are not required to: \n\n\t\t\u2022 phase out annual dollar limits on key benefits\n\t\t\u2022 eliminate preexisting condition exclusions for children under 19 years old\n\n\tDepending on the reasons for making changes to a grandfathered plan, the plan may or may not lose its grandfathered status. If you lose grandfathered status, all provisions of ACA apply upon renewal.\n\n\tExamples of reasons a grandfathered plan may lose its status in general:\n\n\t\t\u2022 terminating an option plan offering due to cost reasons only - no bona fide business reason to terminate the option plan offering\n\t\t\u2022 elimination of certain types of benefits or treatments of certain benefits\n\t\t\u2022 increasing percentage cost-sharing\n\t\t\u2022 increases in fixed-amount cost-sharing above 15 percent of the medical inflation rate\n\t\t\u2022 decreasing the employer contribution rate more than 5 percent below the rate paid on March 23, 2010\n\t\t\u2022 adding annual limits that are lower than the lifetime limit in place on March 23, 2010\n\n\tExamples of changes that can be made without a grandfathered plan losing its status in general:\n\n\t\t\u2022 employees may voluntarily transfer from one grandfathered plan to another\n\t\t\u2022 changes in plan offerings due to bona fide business reasons\n\t\t\u2022 changing the insurance contract or insurers (effective November 15, 2010)\n\t\t\u2022 changing plan funding - from self-insured to fully-insured or vice versa\n\t\t\u2022 changes to a stop-loss insurance policy\n\t\t\u2022 eliminating coverage for a segment of the workforce adding benefits or options\n\nExcepted Plans\n\n\tThe Affordable Care Act mandates apply to plans issued by health insurance issuers including insurance companies, insurance services, insurance organizations, and health maintenance organizations through group health coverage whether insured or self-insured or through individual health coverage.\n\n\tThere are certain benefits which are considered to be \"excepted\" from the healthcare reform Public Health Services Act (PHSA) portion of the mandates. Some examples of these benefits include:\n\n\t\t\u2022 accident-only coverage \n\t\t\u2022 dental plans\n\t\t\u2022 worker's compensation coverage \n\t\t\u2022 specific disease coverage\n\t\t\u2022 hospital indemnity or other fixed indemnity coverage \n\t\t\u2022 separate policies for Medicare or Armed Forces supplements \n\t\t\u2022 credit coverage\n\t\t\u2022 coverage for on-site medical clinics \n\t\t\u2022 disability income coverage\n\t\t\u2022 medical coverage issued to groups with less than 2 employees \n\t\t\u2022 health savings accounts\n\t\t\u2022 long-term care plans \n\t\t\u2022 retiree-only plans \n\t\t\u2022 tribal plans\n\t\t\u2022 vision plans\n\nMoving Forward Under Affordable Care Act Implementation\n\n\tAs of the date of this book's publication, a portion of the ACA mandates have been implemented. Other mandates are either in the process of being implemented, are subject to clarifying guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services or other federal agencies, or are scheduled to be implemented at a future date.\n\n\tUnder certain circumstances there are allowances for delaying compliance with some or all of the mandates. These allowances include:\n\n\t\t\u2022 grandfathering the plan\n\t\t\u2022 issuing coverage on an excepted eligible populations \n\t\t\u2022 issuing coverage on excepted benefits or products\n\t\t\u2022 applying for annual waivers to avoid compliance with the annual dollar limit prohibition implementation\n\t\t\u2022 applying for waivers to avoid compliance with the medical loss ratio for individual plans\n\n\tThe following chapter discussions about medical expense plan types, benefit structures, taxation, eligibility and other requirements incorporate ACA changes as appropriate. Whether a medical expense plan qualifies or not for circumstances allowing for compliance delays or waivers will determine which medical expense plan provisions or benefits need to be modified to meet compliance requirements. Plans that are not compliant may be subject to taxation penalties or ultimately extinction."

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider. Unlike HMOs, which determine fees on a per-person basis, however, PPOs determine fees on a per-service basis.\n    The following provider, financial, and customer-service factors should be considered in evaluating PPO performance:\n\nProvider information\n    Provider information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How are providers solicited and screened?\n\u25a1 Are there sufficient network providers for good freedom of choice?\n\u25a1 Are network providers accessible to employees?\n\u25a1 What is the turnover of providers in the program?\n\u25a1 Are providers generally available or are there special schedules?\n\u25a1 What providers are in the network, and are they the same providers employees use?\n\nFinancial information\n    Financial information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How long has the PPO been in existence?\n\u25a1 Is the sponsor financially sound?\n\u25a1 Are there administrative costs?\n\u25a1 What is the effect on insurance premiums?\n\u25a1 How much are the provider discounts?\n\u25a1 Are there utilization controls to prevent PPOs from making fraudulent claims or providing unnecessary services?\n\u25a1 Has credentialing been sought?\n\nCustomer service factors\n    Customer service factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 Does the sponsor help market the program to employees?\n\u25a1 Are there special program features for emergencies or information?\n\u25a1 Are the program mechanics convenient and easy for employees to use?\n\u25a1 How are problems resolved?\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 725 - Health Benefits - HIPAA: Privacy of Medical Records\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released final regulations designed to secure the confidentiality of health plan participants' medical information. The final regulations extend privacy protection to all types of personal health information, including medical records and other individually identifiable health information, created or held by covered entities, including oral records and paper records that have not existed in electronic form. Covered entities include health plans (including employer-sponsored plans), health care clearing\u00ad houses, and health care providers.(Reference 1 below)\n\tProtected health information. With few exceptions, an individual's protected health information (PHI) can be used for health purposes only. This includes such things as health care treatment, payment, and operations. PHI is defined as all individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained by a covered entity, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally.(Reference 2 below) Health information cannot be used for purposes not related to health care, such as use by employers to make personnel decisions or use by financial institutions, without explicit authorization from the individual. Disclosures of information must be limited to the minimum necessary for the purpose of the disclosure. This rule does not apply to the transfers of medical records for treatment purposes because physicians and other providers need access to the full medical record.(Reference 3 below)\n\tNot all medical information kept by a company is protected PHI. Whether it is protected depends on whether an entity creates or receives the information in its role as an employer or in its role as a group health plan, and thus as a covered entity. For example, when an individual gives his or her medical information to the covered entity as the employer, such as when submitting a doctor's statement to document sick leave, or when the covered entity as employer obtains the employee's written authorization for disclosure of protected health information, such as an authorization to disclose the results of a fitness for duty examination, that medical information becomes part of the employment record, and, as such, is no longer protected health information. (Remember, though, that the covered entity as employer may be subject to other laws and regulations applicable to the use or disclosure of information in an employee's employment record).(Reference 4 below)\n\tHealth plan defined. A \"health plan\" includes any employee welfare benefit plan as defined under ERISA Sec. 3(1) (regardless of whether it is insured or self\u00adinsured) to the extent that the plans provide medical care, an HMO, a long-term care policy, an employee welfare benefit plan that provides health care to the employees of two or more employers, and any other individual or group health plan that provides or pays for the cost of medical care. Health FSAs are, therefore, covered by the privacy rule.(Reference 5 below)\n\tNotice requirements. The privacy rules require covered entities to provide patients with notice of the patients' privacy rights and the privacy practices of the covered entity, although this requirement is optional for health plans. The strengthened notice requires direct treatment providers to make a good faith effort to obtain patients' written acknowledgement of the notice of privacy rights and practices.(Reference 6 below)\n\tDisclosure of full medical record for treatment. For most disclosures, such as information submitted with bills, covered entities are required to send only the minimum information needed for the purpose of the disclosure. Under the final rules, however, providers are given full discretion to determine what personal health information to include when sending patients' medical records to other providers for treatment purposes.(Reference 7 below)\n\tRequired procedures. The final regulation establishes privacy safeguard standards that covered entities must meet but it leaves detailed policies and procedures for meeting these standards to the discretion of each covered entity. Covered entities must:\n\t\t\u25a1 Adopt written privacy procedures, including who has access to protected information, how it will be used within the entity, and when the information would or would not be disclosed to others. They must also take steps to ensure that their business associates protect the privacy of health information.\n\t\t\u25a1 Train employees and designate a privacy officer. Covered entities must provide sufficient training so that their employees understand the new privacy protection procedures and designate an individual to be responsible for ensuring the procedures are followed.\n\t\t\u25a1 Establish grievance processes. Covered entities must provide a means for patients to make inquiries or complaints regarding the privacy of their records.(Reference 8 below)\n\tPointer: The HHS generally does not consider facility redesigns, such as office space redesigns or computer system upgrades, as necessary to meet the reasonableness standard for minimum necessary uses. However, covered entities may need to make certain adjustments to their facilities to minimize access, such as isolating and locking file cabinets or records rooms, or providing additional security, such as passwords, on computers maintaining personal information.\n\tOral communications. According to the HHS, although covered entities must take reasonable safeguards to protect PHI, it is not expected that these safeguards guarantee the privacy of PHI from any and all potential risks. In determining whether safeguards are reasonable, HHS will take into account all the circumstances, including the potential effects on patient care and the financial and administrative burden of any safeguards. Covered entities will not be required to soundproof rooms, provide private rooms for each communication, or encrypt their telephones as long as reasonable safeguards, such as speaking with lowered voices, are taken. Also, the guidelines clarify that covered entities do not need to provide patients access to oral information.(Reference 9 below)\n\tMinimum necessary requirement. HIPM requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The rule requires that for all uses and many disclosures and requests for disclosures, covered entities implement policies and procedures for minimum necessary uses and disclosures. These policies and procedures will allow covered entities to avoid making a \"minimum necessary\" determination on a case-by-case basis. To allow covered entities the flexibility to address their unique circumstances, the rule requires covered entities to make their own assessment of what PHI is reasonably necessary for a particular purpose, given the characteristics of their business and workforce, and to implement policies and procedures accordingly.This is not a strict standard and covered entities need not limit information uses or disclosures to those that are absolutely needed to serve the purpose. Rather, this is a \n\treasonableness standard that calls for an approach consistent with the best practices and guidelines already used by many providers today to limit the unnecessary sharing of medical information.(Reference 10 below)\n\tPrivacy breaches. Privacy provisions for PHI set forth in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (ARRA) must be followed by both business associates and covered entities. A breach of privacy is defined in ARRA as unauthorized acquisition, access, or use, or disclosure of PHI which compromises security or privacy of PHI except where an unauthorized person would not reasonably have been able to retain PHI.(Reference 11 below)\n\tDefinition of ''breach.\" The term \"breach\" means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule that compromises the security or privacy of the PHl.(Reference 12 below) Compromising the security or privacy of the PHI means posing a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI constitutes a breach, covered entities and business associates will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is a significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. In performing the risk assessment, covered entities and business associates should consider the following factors:\n\t\t\u25a1 the type and amount of protected health information involved;\n\t\t\u25a1 who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;\n\t\t\u25a1 whether the covered entity took immediate steps to mitigate an impermissible use or disclosure; and\n\t\t\u25a1 whether PHI was returned prior to it being accessed for an improper purpose.(Reference 13 below)\n\t\n\tBreach exclusions. A breach does not occur in the following situations:\n\t\t1. any unintentional acquisition, access, or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a covered entity or a business associate if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule;\n\t\t2. any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a covered entity or business associate to another person authorized to access PHI at the same covered entity or business associate, or organized health care arrangement in which the covered entity participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule; and\n\t\t3. a disclosure of PHI where a covered entity or business associate has a good faith belief that an authorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.(Reference 14 below)\n\tExample: A billing employee receives and opens an e-mail containing PHI that a nurse mistakenly sent to the employee. The billing employee notices that he is not the intended recipient, alerts the nurse of the misdirected e-mail, and then deletes it. The billing employee's use of the information was done in good faith and within the scope of authority, and, therefore, would not constitute a breach and notification would not be required, provided the employee did not further use or disclose the information accessed in a manner not permitted by the Privacy Rule.\n\tExample: A receptionist at a covered entity who is not authorized to access PHI decides to look through patient files in order to learn of a friend's treatment. In this case, the impermissible access to PHI would not fall within the exceptions because such access was neither unintentional, done in good faith, nor within the scope of authority.\n\tExample: A covered entity, due to a lack of reasonable safeguards, sends a number of explanations of benefits (EOBs) to the wrong individuals. A few of the EOBs are returned by the post office, unopened, as undeliverable. In these circumstances, the covered entity can conclude that the improper addressees could not reasonably have retained the information. The EOBs that were not returned as undeliverable, however, and that the covered entity knows were sent to the wrong individuals, should be treated as potential breaches.\n\tBreach notice requirements. In instances of breach, ARRA requires notification of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed as a result of the breach. If a business associate discovers the breach, it must notify the covered entity, and a covered entity must make notification to the HHS no later than 60 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. In situations where a major breach covering the PHI of more than 500 individuals occurs, notice must be provided to prominent media outlets in the appropriate state or jurisdiction. Major breaches must be provided to the HHS immediately. Breaches covering fewer than 500 individuals require the covered entity to maintain a log of the breaches and submit it on an annual basis to the HHS.(Reference 15 below) The privacy rules require covered entities to provide patients with notice of the patient's privacy rights and the privacy practices of the covered entity, although this requirement is\noptional for health plans.(Reference 16 below) The strengthened notice requires direct treatment providers to make a good faith effort to obtain patient's written acknowledgment of the notice of privacy rights and practices.(Reference 17 below)\n\tHHS has clarified that the breach notification requirements only apply to unsecured PHI, which is PHI not secured through HHS-approved technology or guidance. In addition, once PHI is rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals by one or more HHS-approved method, such as encryption or destruction, then such information is not considered to be unsecured PH1.(Reference below)\n\tContent of breach notice. Final regulations require the breach notification to include, to the extent possible, the following elements:\n\t\t1. a brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;\n\t\t2. a description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code, or other types of information were involved);\n\t\t3. any steps individuals should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the breach;\n\t\t4. a brief description of what the covered entity involved is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals, and to protect against any further breaches; and\n\t\t5. contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which must include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, Web site, or postal address.(Reference 19 below)\n\tMethods of notification. A covered entity must provide breach notice to the individual in written form by first-class mail at the last known address of the individual. Written notice may be in the form of electronic mail, provided the individual agrees to receive electronic notice and such agreement has not been withdrawn.(Reference 20 below) Where the individual affected by a breach is a minor or otherwise lacks legal capacity due to a physical or mental condition, notice to the parent or other person who is the personal representative of the individual will satisfy these requirements. If an individual is deceased, such notice may be sent to either the individual's next of kin or personal representative.\n\tIf a covered entity does not have sufficient contact information for some or all of the affected individuals, or if some notices are returned as undeliverable, the covered entity must provide substitute notice for the unreachable individuals.(Reference 21 below) If there are fewer than 10 individuals for whom the covered entity has insufficient or out-of-date contact information to provide the written notice, the covered entity may provide substitute notice to such individuals through an alternative form of written notice, by telephone, or other means. If a covered entity has insufficient or out-of\u00ad date contact information for 10 or more individuals, the covered entity must provide substitute notice through either a conspicuous posting for a period of 90 days on the home page of its Web site or conspicuous notice in major print or broadcast media in geographic areas where the individuals affected by the breach likely reside.(Reference 22 below)\n\tNotification to the media. Covered entities must provide notice to prominent media outlets serving a state or jurisdiction following the discovery of a breach if the unsecured PHI of more than 500 residents of such state or jurisdiction is, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach. A covered entity must notify prominent media outlets without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.(Reference 23 below) Notification to the media must include the same information required to be included in the notification to the individual (see \"Content of breach notice\" discussion above) .(Reference 24 below)\n\tNotification to the HHS Secretary. Covered entities must notify the Secretary of breaches of unsecured PHI. For breaches involving 500 or more individuals, covered entities must notify the Secretary immediately and, at the same time, provide individual notification (as discussed above).(Reference 25 below) The notification must be provided in a manner to be specified on the HHS Web site. HHS will post instructions on its Web site for submitting this notification.(Reference 26 below)\n\tFor breaches involving less than 500 individuals, covered entities may maintain a log of such breaches and annually submit such log to the Secretary documenting the breaches occurring during the year involved.(Reference 27 below) The log must be submitted no later than 60 days after the end of each calendar year. The information must be provided to the Secretary in the manner specified on the HHS Web site. HHS will specify on its Web site the information to be submitted and how to submit such information.(Reference 28 below)\n\tNotification by a business associate. Following the discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI, a business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach no later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. (Reference 29 below) Business associates, to the extent possible, must provide covered entities with the identity of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached.(Reference 30 below)\n\tBusiness associates. The requirements that covered entities have under the HIPM privacy rule now apply directly to their business associates. Covered entities have to obtain satisfactory assurances through written agreements from their business associates who have access to protected health information that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information.(Reference 31 below) HHS has clarified, however, that a covered entity is not liable for privacy violations of a business associate and that covered entities do not have to actively monitor the means by which the business associate carries out safeguards. Business associate relation\u00ad ships arise when a covered entity has the right to use or disclose protected health information and another party is using that information to perform a function or activity on behalf of the covered entity. Members of a covered entity's workforce are not business associates and entities that share common ownership or control can be designated as one covered \nentity.(Reference 32 below)\n \n\tSome of the items that should appear in a business associate agreement include:\n\t\t\u25a1 ways the business associate is permitted to use PHI;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate follow appropriate safeguards;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate report PHI violations to the plan;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate return or destroy PHI when feasible; and\n\t\t\u25a1 a provision providing for termination of the agreement if a \"material breach\" occurs.(Reference 33 below)\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services included sample business associate contract provisions in the preamble of the privacy rule.\n\tDisclosure of enrollment information. The final rule allows a group health plan, a health insurance issuer, or HMO acting for a group health plan to disclose to a plan sponsor, such as an employer, information on whether the individual is enrolled in or has disenrolled from a plan offered by the sponsor without amending the plan documents.(Reference 34 below)\n\tIndividual rights. HIPPA also allows individuals to control, to some extent, how their protected health information will be used. For example, individuals have the right to:\n\t\t\u25a1 obtain a notice of how a covered entity will use and disclose their protected health information;\n\t\t\u25a1 request restrictions on the uses and disclosures of their protected health information for treatment, payment, and health care operations;\n\t\t\u25a1 request restrictions on the uses and disclosures for which neither a consent nor authorization is required;\n\t\t\u25a1 access, inspect and copy their health information;\n\t\t\u25a1 request an amendment to their health information; and\n\t\t\u25a1 request an accounting of disclosures of their protected health information. (Reference 35 below)\n\n\tPrivacy officers. To administer all of these rules, HIPM requires that covered entities designate a privacy officer. This privacy officer is responsible for the implementation and development of the entity's privacy policies and proce\u00ad dures. There must also be a person designated to receive complaints and provide information regarding privacy. This person may or may not be the privacy officer.(Reference 36 below)\n\tInternal policies and procedures. HIPM requires covered entities to implement policies and procedures with respect to PHI that are designed to comply with \"all the requirements of the HIPM privacy rule.\" (Reference 37 below)\n \n\tState laws. Stronger state laws, such as those covering mental health or AIDS information, continue to apply. The final rules set a national \"floor\" of privacy standards.\n\tPenalties. HIPAA provides civil and criminal penalties for covered entities that misuse personal health information. Civil monetary penalties for unintentional disclosures are $100 per incident, up to $25,000 per person, per year, per standard.\n\tFederal criminal penalties could be imposed for health plans, providers, and clearinghouses that knowingly and improperly disclose information or obtain information under false pretenses. Penalties would be higher for actions to generate financial gain. Criminal penalties are up to $50,000 and one year in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information (PHD; up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison for obtaining PHI under \"false pretenses\"; and up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for obtaining or disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer, or use it for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.(Reference 38 below)\n\tRevised civil penalties. Pursuant to a portion of ARRA called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), the penalties for noncompliance with the HIPAA privacy and data security requirements were increased. Under the HITECH Act, HHS is required to impose a civil monetary penalty for noncompliance due to willful neglect. The penalties apply to health plans, as well as business associates.(Reference 39 below)\n\tThe HIPAA civil monetary penalties have been adjusted as follows:(Reference 40 below)\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each pre-February 2009 violation of the HIPAA administrative simplification provision: $159 (up from $155), with a calendar year cap of $39,936 (up from $38,954).\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which a covered entity or business associate did not know and, by exercising reasonable diligence, would not have known that violation occurred: $117 minimum (up from $114), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which it is established that the violation was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect $1,170 minimum (up from $1,141), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which the violation was due to willful neglect and timely corrected (generally within 30 days): $11,698 minimum (up from $11,410), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which the violation was due to willful neglect, but not timely corrected: $58,490 minimum (up from $57,051), $1,754,698 maxi\u00ad mum (up from $1,711,533), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.11725\n \n\tIf HHS fails to act, the law allows state attorneys general to bring civil lawsuits to enforce penalties.(Reference 41 below)\n\tHITECH regulations. Final HHS rules strengthened and expanded enforcement of privacy, security, and enforcement rules in HIPM and the subsequently issued HITECH Act by implementing the following measures:\n\t\t1) expanded individuals' rights to access their information and to restrict certain types of disclosures of protected health information (PHD to health plans. Patients can ask for a copy of their electronic medical record in an electronic form;(Reference 42 below)\n\t\t2) required business associates of HIPM-covered entities to follow most of the same rules as the covered entities;\n\t\t3) set new limitations on the use and disclosure of PHI for marketing and fundraising;(Reference 43 below)\n\t\t4) prohibited the sale of PHI without patient authorization. Under the regulations, if a covered entity is to receive remuneration for the sale of PHI, it would have to include in the authorization a statement that the disclosure will result in remuneration to the covered entity.(Reference 44 below)\n\n\tThe final regulations also modified the individual authorization and other requirements to facilitate research and disclosure of child immunization proof to schools.(Reference 45 below), and.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.HHS Reg. \u00a7 160.103.\n2.

Generally, all ERISA health plans must comply with these laws, with some exceptions for small businesses. The goal of the program is to provide employers and health plans with the opportunity to understand the laws' requirements and make necessary changes.\n\tEBSAs' HIPAA Compliance Assistance Program, or H-CAP, will help the benefits community address specific compliance issues. H-CAP is a three-pronged program that includes publications targeted to assist group health plans and health insurers comply with the health laws, a section of the EBSA Web page dedicated to health law material (www.dol.gov/ebsa/compliance_assistance.html) , and sponsorship of compliance assistance workshops around the country.

Violations of HIPAA's fraud and abuse standards or its confidentiality provisions could result in fines and/or imprisonment.\n\tThe term \"federal health care offense\" includes knowingly obtaining money from a health care benefit program under false pretenses, stealing or embezzling from a health benefit plan, or falsifying or concealing a material fact. Therefore, in addition to any penalties for fiduciary breach under ERISA, plans may be subject to criminal penalties ranging from fines to life imprisonment.(Reference 1 below)\n\tPointer: Employers should review health plan documents and require providers to disclose any fraud and abuse they are aware of. They also need to specifically define who is covered in their plan. An example of a violation may include allowing an employee to cover a grandchild or boyfriend when the plan does not recognize those relationships for coverage.\n\tExpansion of federal health care offense. As of March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) has expanded the definition of \"federal health care offense\" to include crimes barring an individual from serving as a plan administrator or fiduciary under ERISA as well as coercive interference with benefit plan rights.(Reference 2 below)\n\tConfidentiality. Protecting confidentiality becomes critically important. In an effort to simplify plan administration, HIPAA makes it a federal crime to knowingly use, obtain, or disclose individually identifiable health information without authorization. The penalty for wrongful disclosure includes fines, ranging from $50,000 to $250,000, or imprisonment for up to 10 years.(Reference 3 below)\n\n\tPointer: Employers need to have policies and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of any information handled by them or their claims administrators. The chain of liability could include whoever knows and could be applicable to past, present, and future medical histories.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -  Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - Health Savings Accounts\n\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs)\n\n\tIn addition to providing prescription drug coverage for older Americans, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs are designed as successors to Archer MSAs, which are briefly discussed later, and the two have many features in common. However, they also have some notable differences that make HSAs more attractive than Archer MSAs and available to a much larger pool of consumers.\n\n\tHSAs were allowed as early as 2004. Various surveys indicate that by 2009 there were 6 to 7 million people with high-deductible health plans that met the criteria for them to also have HSAs. About three-quarters of these people have such health plans through employer-provided medical expense arrangements, but only about half of this group have either established HSAs or had their employers establish HSAs for them.\n\nGeneral Nature\n\n\tAn HSA is a personal savings account from which unreimbursed medical expenses, including deductibles, percentage participation, and copayments, can be paid. The HSA must be in the form of a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established in conjunction with a high-deductible health (medical expense) plan. An HSA is established with a qualified trustee or custodian in much the same way that an IRA is established. Any insurance company or bank (as well as certain other financial institutions) can be a trustee or custodian, as can any other person or entity already approved by the IRS as a trustee or custodian for IRAs.\n\n\tHSAs are individual trusts, which prohibits a husband and wife from having a joint HSA. But as long as both are eligible, each may have a separate HSA.\n\n\tSome insurers that sell high-deductible health plans for use with HSAs also market the HSA accounts; other insurers leave it to the purchasers of a high-deductible health plan to establish their HSAs with other institutions.\n\n\tEven though employers can sponsor HSAs, these accounts are established for the benefit of individuals and are portable. If an employee changes employers or leaves the workforce, the HSA, including the balance in the account, remains with the individual.\n\nEligibility\n\n\tEmployees, the self-employed, and anyone else can establish HSAs as long as they meet the following rules for qualification:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual must be covered by a high-deductible health plan. That plan may be insured or self-insured if offered by an employer as long as it meets the criteria for a qualifying high-deductible plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual is not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person's federal income tax return.\n\n\t\t\u2022 With some exceptions, a person who is covered under a high-deductible health plan is denied eligibility for an HSA if he or she is covered under another health plan that does not meet the definition of a high-deductible plan but that provides any benefits that are covered under the high-deductible health plan. The exceptions include coverage for accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care as well as liability insurance, insurance for a specified disease or illness, and insurance paying a fixed amount per period of hospitalization. Participation in a typical FSA would make an individual ineligible to participate in an HSA unless the FSA only provided reimbursement for types of expenses not covered under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\n\tAn employer can establish HSAs for its employees, or an individual (whether employed or not) may establish his or her own HSA.\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plan\n\n\tFor purposes of HSA participation, a high-deductible health plan is defined as having the following deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limitations for covered services. These figures are for 2012 and subject to annual inflation adjustments:\n\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of self-only coverage, the deductible must be at least $1,200, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $6,050.\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $12,100.\n\n\tIf these high-deductible plans use preferred-provider networks, they can have higher out-of-pocket limits for services provided outside the network, and any deductibles for nonnetwork services are not taken into account when determining the out-of-pocket limits specified above.\n\n\tOne point should be emphasized about the deductible for family coverage. It is not a family deductible as was described in the discussion on major medical insurance. In that situation, there is an individual deductible that\napplies to each family member as well as a separate deductible for the family. This is sometimes referred to as an embedded deductible, and the policy pays benefits for any family member once his or her deductible is satisfied, even if the family deductible is not yet met.\n\n\tIn the case of a high-deductible policy used with an HSA, there will usually not be an individual deductible if a policy is written for a family. Rather, there will be a single deductible-referred to as a common deductible-that must be satisfied before any benefits are payable, even if all claims are for one family member. It is permissible, however, to use an embedded deductible, but only if the individual deductible is equal to at least the required HSA family deductible of $2,400.\n\n\tThe following incurred expenses do not count toward the plan's required deductible and out-of-pocket limit:\n\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services not covered by the high-deductible health plan\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services received from nonnetwork health care providers, if the plan uses a preferred-provider network\n\t\t\u2022 amounts above a plan's reasonable allowable specific service maximums\n\t\t\u2022 amounts in excess of reasonable and customary fees \n\t\t\u2022 penalties for failure to obtain a plan-required certification\n\n\tNevertheless, copayments and required percentage participation count toward the out-of-pocket limit, even if the plan does not consider them as contributing toward the satisfaction of the deductible. In addition, the deductible amount counts towards the out-of-pocket limit. However, employee contributions paid for the coverage do not count.\n\nPreventive Care\n\n\tGenerally, a high-deductible health plan established in conjunction with an HSA cannot provide benefits before the deductible is satisfied, but there is an exception for benefits for preventive care. A high-deductible health plan may provide benefits for the following preventive care services before the insured satisfies the plan's required high deductible:\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual physicals, immunizations, and screening services\n\n\t\t\u2022 routine prenatal and well-child care\n\n\t\t\u2022 tobacco cessation programs and obesity weight-loss programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 employee-assistance, disease management, or wellness programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 treatment of a related condition that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive care service or screening, such as removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy\n\n\t\t\u2022 drugs or medications taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease before the disease manifests itself or to prevent the reoccurrence of a disease from which the person has recovered. An example is the drug treatment of high cholesterol to prevent heart disease, or the treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with medications to prevent a recurrence. Other prescription drugs that do not qualify under this exception remain subject to the plan's high deductible.\n\nPreventive care must be offered with no cost-sharing.\n\nContributions\n\n\tContributions to an HSA may be made solely by individuals who have such accounts. They may also be made by employers that provide their employees with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIndividual Contributions\n\n\tIndividuals often fund HSAs without employer contributions because they are not employees or because their employer makes no contribution to HSAs. Contributions must be in the form of cash, and they are deductible for federal income tax purposes even if the individual does not itemize deductions.\n\n\tThe maximum annual contribution to an HSA in 2012 is $3,100 if the account holder has self-only coverage and $6,250 if the account holder has family coverage. These amounts are subject to annual indexing for inflation. As a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the full maximum contribution is allowed even if it exceeds the policy deductible amount under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\tIf both a husband and wife establish an HSA and have family coverage (that is, a single policy covering both of them), they can allocate the maximum contribution in any way they determine. If they have separate policies, each is subject to the limits that apply to self-only coverage.\n\n\tIndividuals aged 55 or older are also permitted an additional annual catch-up contribution of up to $1,000. If both a husband and wife are aged 55 or older, the catch-up contribution is available to each of them only if they have separate HSAs.\n\n\tAnnual contributions can be made in a lump sum or spread out over time. However, the contributions for a specific tax year cannot be made before the tax year begins or after the taxpayer's original filing date (without extensions) for that tax year. For most individuals, this is the earlier of April 15 of the following year or the date a return is filed. This is similar to the rules for IRA contributions.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJack and Eva, a married couple, retired last year when they each reached age 56. They purchased a family medical expense policy with a $5,000 deductible, and Jack established an HSA. The maximum contribution to the HSA for 2012 is $7,250, which consists of the regular $6,250 limit and an additional catch-up amount of $1,000 for Jack.\n\n\tHowever, i\u00a3 they each established an HSA, they both would be eligible to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution to their own accounts. The$6,250 regular contribution could be allocated between the two accounts as they agree upon. The net effect is that the total HSA contributions would increase to $8,250.\n\n\tThey can make these contributions in one or more payments between January 1, 2012 and the date they file their 2012 tax return.\n\n\tIf an individual stops participating in an HSA during a tax year, the actual HSA contribution that can be deducted for the tax year is limited to 1/12 of the annual amount, as described previously, times the number of months that an individual is eligible for HSA participation. Until 2007, the same rule applied if an individual began participating in an HSA after January of the tax-year-only a proportionate contribution could be made. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act changed the rule as long as an individual is still eligible to participate in an HSA during the last month of a tax-year. In such a situation, the individual is allowed to make the full annual tax-deductible contribution for the year. However, if he or she fails to remain eligible for an HSA for at least 12 months thereafter (other than because of death or disability), the contribution for the prior year that is attributable to months when the account holder did not have an HSA is includible in gross income and subject to a 20 percent penalty tax.\n\n\tAn excess contribution occurs to the extent that contributions to an HSA exceed the tax-deductible limits or are made for an ineligible person. The account holder is subject to a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions (including those made by an employer) for each year these contributions are in an account. This excise tax can be avoided if the excess amount and any net income attributable to the excess amount are removed from the HSA prior to the last day prescribed by law, (including extensions) for filing the account holder's income tax return. The net income attributable to the excess contributions is included in the account holder's gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is made.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\tPaul, aged 55, is eligible for an HSA and has a self-only high-deductible policy. In January 2012, he made a contribution of $2,000 to the HSA. On July 1, Paul decided to cease being a self-employed freelance editor and become an employee of a magazine. He cancelled his previous medical expense policy and enrolled in his new employer's, which did not qualify as a high-deductible health plan. As a result, Paul's allowable HSA contribution for the year is only 6/12 of $3,000, or $1,500. He is now in the position of having made an excess contribution for the year. As long as he withdraws the other $500 plus any earnings on this amount before filing his 2012 tax return, he will avoid any adverse tax consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\tJane, aged 39, did just the opposite of Paul. She left her prior job with an employer and became a self-employed consultant. This occurred on November 1, 2012, when she dropped her former HMO coverage through the employer and purchased a high-deductible medical expense policy for herself and her son. She also established an HSA. She is eligible to make the full 2012 contribution of $6,250 and took it as a deduction on her 2012 tax return. However, if she does not continue to be covered under a high-deductible health plan through 2013, a portion of this amount will have to be included as taxable income for 2013.\n\nRoll-Over Contributions\n\n\tAn account balance from an Archer MSA can be rolled over to an HSA on a tax-free basis. Similarly, account balances from an existing HSA can be rolled over to a new HSA.\n\n\tThe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also allows certain other types of tax-free rollovers in specific circumstances. For example, an account holder who establishes an HSA is allowed a one-time rollover of funds from an HRA or health FSA. The amount of the rollover, which is in addition to any regular contribution for the year, is limited to the lesser of the balance in such an account on (1) September 21, 2006, or (2) the date of the rollover. If the account holder does not remain eligible to participate in an HSA for at least one year after the rollover, the amount of the rollover is included in income for tax purposes and subject to a penalty tax. Finally, an account holder may make a one-time-only rollover from an IRA. The amount of the rollover is limited to the tax-deductible HSA contribution for the year and reduces any regular contribution allowed.\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\n\tMany persons with HDHPs have their coverage under an employer-provided plan, and their employer may make contributions to the HSAs of employees. Employer contributions belong to the employee and are nonforfeitable. The employer might make the maximum annual contribution as previously described. However, it is also possible that the employer contribution will contribute a lower amount. In this case, an employee can make any remaining allowable contribution.\n\n\tAn employer that contributes to HSAs is subject to a nondiscrimination rule that requires the employer to make comparable contributions for all employees who have HSAs. Failure to comply with this rule subjects the employer to an excise tax. However, full-time employees and part-time employees (those working fewer than 30 hours per week) are treated separately. The comparability rule generally requires that the employer contribute either the same dollar amount for each employee or the same percentage of each employee's deductible under the health plan. However, it is permissible for an employer to make larger contributions for nonhighly-compensated employees than for highly compensated employees.\n\nHSA Account Growth\n\n\tUnused amounts in an HSA accumulate on a tax-free basis and carry over to subsequent years without limit. The size of an HSA balance carried over from prior years has no effect on a current year's contribution.\n\nDistributions from an HSA\n\n\tAn individual can usually take distributions from an HSA at any time, but the trust or custodial document may put reasonable restrictions on both the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. Generally, accounts are set up so that they can be accessed with debit cards or checks written by the account holder as an alternative to actually filing for reimbursement. The amount of the distribution can be any part or all of the account balance. Subject to some exceptions, distributions of both contributions and earnings are excludible from an account holder's gross income if used to pay medical expenses of the account holder and the account holder's legal spouse and tax dependents as long as these expenses are not paid by other sources of insurance. There is no requirement that these family members be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. If both a husband and wife have HSAs, the reimbursement for any family can come from either or both HSAs but together cannot exceed the amount of the unreimbursed expense.\n\n\tFor the most part, the eligible medical expenses are the same ones that would be deductible, ignoring the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation (10 percent in 2013), if the account holder itemized his or her income tax deductions. Tax-free withdrawals are permitted for the purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for the purchase of health coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation. They are also permitted for the purchase of long-term care insurance up to certain deductible limits. However, tax-free withdrawals are not otherwise permitted for the purchase of health insurance by persons under age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tEric has accumulated $6,000 in his HSA account during the last 3 years. Because hjs wife has medical expense coverage with her employer, Eric's high-deductible policy is for him only.\n\n\tIn February, Eric incurred his first medical expenses for the year when he severely sprained his wrist. He incurred $1,000 in medical expenses that were not covered under his policy because the $5,000 deductible had not been met. Eric can pay for these expenses with funds from his HSA.\n\n\tIn April, Eric had a routine eye examination that cost $120. This examination was not covered under his medical expense policy, but it qualifies as a medical expense for IRS purposes. Therefore, Eric can take a $120 tax-free distribution from his HSA.\n\n\tIn July, Eric's wife had a crown installed by her dentist. Her employer-provided health insurance paid only $600 of the dentist's bill. Eric can use his HSA to pay the remaining $400 because HSA funds can be used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses of an account holder's legal spouse. (Note that the IRS considers medical expenses to include charges for dental services.)\n\n\n\tEven though contributions cannot be made after an individual reaches age 65 and becomes a Medicare beneficiary, tax-free distributions can still be used for any future qualified medical expenses, which include premiums for original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage plans, and medical expense coverage under employer-sponsored plans. However, an account holder cannot use tax-free distributions to pay premiums for a Medicare supplement policy.\n\n\tFrom a financial planning standpoint, account holders may want to wait until after retirement or age 65 to take HSA distributions as long as they have the resources to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses prior to that time. This will allow their HSA balances to grow on a tax-favored basis for use in their older years when unreimbursed medical expenses may be higher and/or income may be lower.\n\n\tDistributions are permitted for other reasons, but they are subject to income taxation and possibly to a 20 percent penalty tax. However, the penalty tax does not apply in the case of distributions after an individual's death, disability, or the attainment of age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKirby has a balance of $7,000 in his HSA. At age 67, he rediscovered his childhood sweetheart and fell madly in love. She agreed to marry him and he wants to give her a big diamond ring. Because she told Kirby that she would take care of him for life, he decided to cash in his HSA and apply the proceeds to purchase the ring. His tax accountant informed Kirby that this arrangement would not be a qualified medical expense. He can withdraw the funds without penalty because he is at least age 65, but the $7,000 must be included in his gross income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\n\tFormer employees, including retirees, may continue HSAs that were established prior to termination of employment, and the rules for contributions and distributions are as previously described.\n\n\tRetirees who did not have an HSA prior to retirement can establish one at that time as long as all the proper rules are satisfied. Such an HSA may present an opportunity for a retiree to reduce income taxes. However, the requirement of having a high-deductible plan will probably negate this advantage if an individual has substantial medical expenses.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKathleen, a widow, retired at age 60 from her job as an attorney. She likes the concept of consumer-directed health plans and has decided to establish an HSA. In order to be eligible for the HSA, she purchased a major medical policy with an annual deductible of $2,500. She plans to make the maximum allowable contribution to the HSA until she is eligible for Medicare. She will then use her HSA balance to pay her Medicare premiums.\n\n\tThere are fees involved in establishing an HSA. These fees may affect any potential tax advantages if an HSA is established near the time of Medicare enrollment.\n\nEstate Tax Treatment of HSAs\n\n\tUpon death, the remaining balance in an HSA is includible in the account holder's gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the account is a surviving spouse, the HSA belongs to the spouse and he or she can deduct the account balance in determining the account holder's taxable estate. The surviving spouse can then use the HSA for his or her medical expenses. If the beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, the HSA ceases to exist, and the beneficiary must include the fair market value of the account in his or her gross income for tax purposes. If no beneficiary is named, the tax is payable by the estate or the beneficiary of the estate.\n\nEstablishing and Maintaining HSAs\n\n\tThere are a number of issues that need to be evaluated by an individual who has the option to establish an HSA. Perhaps the most important question is whether such an account is appropriate. After a person decides to establish an HSA, issues such as account fees, investment options for funds, and record keeping must be addressed.\n\nAppropriateness of HSAs\n\n\tFor some persons, an HSA is very appropriate and offers significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities. For other persons, an HSA may not be an attractive financial commitment. An HSA's viability depends on individual circumstances such as income, tax rates, the funds available to fund such an account, when account balance will be withdrawn, earnings on account funds, and account fees. Some of these issues are addressed in the following example.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJohn and his wife, both aged 50, no longer have any dependent children. They are self-employed and have a joint income of $150,000. For the last few years, they have had an HSA-compatible policy with a $5,000 deductible, but have not established HSAs. They are in good health and have paid aU unreimbursed medical expenses from current income. Their financial advisor has suggested that one or both of them should establish an HSA. They have decided to do so, and make an annual contribution of $5,000, which is an affordable financial commitment. This will result in an annual income tax savings of $1,300 (based on IRS estimates). They have also decided to continue paying any unreimbursed medical expenses from current income and to let the HSA funds accumulate until they retire at age 65. They plan on investing the funds and expect them to grow at about 5 percent per year. If this return is achieved, they will have a fund of about $100,000 when they retire. They will then withdraw amounts as needed on a tax-free basis to pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nAccount Fees\n\n\tOne factor that varies widely among financial institutions that offer HSAs is the fees that they charge. If an individual uses an HSA that has been established by his or her employer, the employer may pay some of these fees. But no matter how an account is established, a potential account holder should look at the fees and their impact on the account balance. Unfortunately, this is not always easy to do. Although financial institutions often have information about their HSAs on Web sites or in print, the fee structure is often conspicuously absent or hard to locate. Unlike other types of financial products, such as IRAs, there are no requirements to provide potential account holders with\na prospectus that details the fees. Therefore, it is often necessary to ask specific questions. As the next example demonstrates, these fees may have an effect on the decision to establish an HSA. Even if an HSA is an obvious choice, the account balance will be affected by the fee structure.\n\n\tHSA fees fall into several categories that might include one or more of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 account setup fee. This is a one-time fee to establish the HSA. Such fees typically range from $0 to $50, with $15 or $20 being common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual fee. An HSA may have an annual fee that ranges up to $200, but amounts of $10 to $20 are most common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 monthly maintenance fee. An HSA may have a monthly maintenance fee that ranges up to $10, but amounts like $2 to $3 seem most common. Although there may be both a monthly maintenance fee and an annual fee, this is very uncommon; there is usually one or the other. In either case, the amount of the fee may be lower for higher account balances.\n\n\t\t\u2022 transaction fee. An HSA may have a fee that is levied on each transaction. The fee may apply to contributions, but is most likely to be levied on withdrawals only. Fees may be as high as $5, but $.25 to $.50 are quite common. Sometimes a few transactions are allowed without a fee, but fees are levied on transactions in excess of this number.\n\n\t\t\u2022 account closing fee. It is not unusual for an HSA to have an account closing fee that can range up to $25 or $30, although $10 is a more common amount.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tAmber is an administrative assistant who earns about $40,000 annually. She has an employer-provided medical expense policy with a $2,500 deductible. Her employer has not set up HSAs for employees and makes no HSA contributions. Amber enjoys traveling and what money she has left is being saved for a new car that she hopes to buy within the next 2 years. Amber is healthy and incurs about $500 in unreimbursed medical expenses annually. This typically includes two doctor's visits and quarterly refills of a prescription drug. To minimize her taxes, Amber decides toestablish an HSA. She plans on putting the $500 into an HSA account and taking a withdrawal each time she incurs an unreimbursed medical expense. This will lower her taxes by about $75. When she looks into establishing such an account with her local bank, she finds that they have an account setup fee of $15. There is also a $2 monthly maintenance fee ($24 per year) and a $3 fee for each withdrawal ($18 for her six transactions). Therefore, she will incur expenses of $57 to save $75 the first year. When Amber finds out that her account balance will be too small to earn more than 1 percent interest, she decides that an HSA is not worth the administrative hassle for such a minimal tax savings.\n\nInvestment Options for HSA Funds\n\n\tFinancial institutions often offer several types of investment options for HSA funds. Account holders can invest HSA funds in essentially the same manner as IRA funds. Allowable investments include bank accounts, annuities, certificates of deposit, stocks, mutual funds, and bonds. Investments in life insurance policies or most types of collectibles are prohibited. In addition, an HSA trust or custodial agreement may limit the investment options available.\n\n\tAlthough mutual funds and stocks may result in the best return over a number of years, they are probably unsuitable if an account holder has modest amounts in an HSA that will be used for medical expenses in the near future. Like many types of investments, they will fluctuate in value over time. Such investments may also be unavailable unless an account holder has an account balance of several thousand dollars. The prior example regarding John under the heading Appropriateness shows when such an investment makes sense.\n\n\tIn most cases, an individual will be using some type of bank account that allows easy access to the available funds. In this case, it is important to evaluate the return that these funds will earn, which is set by each bank. In some cases, nothing is paid unless the account exceeds a minimum balance, such as $1,000. Interest rates may also vary by the size of the account's average daily balance. In still other cases, a specified interest rate, which can change, is paid on any size balance. Even with these variations, there are significant differences among banks.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\tCustodians and trustees for HSAs report the amount of annual contributions to and distributions from each HSA to the IRS. Under IRS rules, it is the account holder's responsibility to determine whether distributions from HSAs are for eligible medical expenses. Therefore, individuals who establish such accounts should maintain records in case they are audited. They should also become familiar with the types of expenses that are deductible. Guidance can be found in IRS Publication 502, which is available on the IRS Web site: irs.gov."

Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

In return, the insurer requires employees to pay a deductible amount each year before coverage kicks in. Once the deductible has been met, the insurance company will pay the majority of each bill (usually 70 to 80 percent), and the employee pays the remainder (the co\u00adinsurance charge) of 20 to 30 percent.\n\n                       Fee-for-service plans have been largely replaced by HMOs and PPOs. Indemnity plans give participants complete freedom to chose their providers, but that means that there is no network and no negotiated fee structure, so premiums are higher than with other types of health care plans. As a result, younger, healthier employees tend to move to HMOs and PPOs, causing indemnity plan premiums to increase even more as the number of participants decreases."

                    "text": "KB-5 -   Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Claims\n\nCLAIMS\n     The handling of medical expense claims is different, depending on whether a plan provides benefits on an indemnity basis or on a service basis.\n\n      Subrogation provisions may also apply.\n\nIndemnity Benefits\n       Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on an indemnity basis typically require that the insurance company (or other provider) receive a written proof of loss (that is, a claim form) concerning the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which a covered person makes a claim. This form usually contains portions that must be completed and signed by the employee, a representative of the employer, and the provider of medical services.\n\n      The period during which an employee must file a claim depends on the provider of coverage and any applicable state requirements. An employee generally has at least 90 days (or as soon as is reasonably possible) after medical expenses are incurred to file. Some insurance companies require notification within a shorter time (such as 20 days) about any illness or injury on which a claim may be based, even though they give a longer time for the actual filing of the form itself.\n\n       Individuals have the right to assign their benefits to the providers of medical services. A covered person generally makes such an assignment, which authorizes the insurance company to make the benefit payment directly to the provider by completing the appropriate portion of the claim form. In addition, the insurance company has the right (as it does in disability income insurance) to examine any person for whom a claim is filed at its own expense and with the physician of its own choice.\n\nService Benefits\n      Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on a service basis (such as HMOs and the Blues) generally do not require that covered persons file claim forms. Rather, the providers of health care services perform any necessary paperwork and receive reimbursement directly.\n\n      For example, when a physician presents a claim, the plan must determine one or more of the following: the physician's status as a network participant; the primary or specialty care nature of the service if rendered by a network participant; and the applicability of an authorization requirement. Depending upon the plan's stringency, the provider's reimbursement may be denied altogether or be far less than the amount charged if the member receives services from a nonnetwork provider or sees a specialist without a required referral. In turn, the payment made to the provider determines whether the enrollee must pay a modest copayment, a more substantial amount under an indemnity benefit as described above, or the total amount if there is a claim denial.\n\n      Network providers with capitation payment arrangements file patient encounter forms that in effect are claims that produce no payment for a specific service.\n\nSubrogation\n       Most self-funded plans contain subrogation provisions. If state law allows, they are also commonly contained in the group medical expense contracts of HMOs, PPOs, the Blues, and insurance companies. A subrogation provision gives the plan (or the organization providing plan benefits) the right to recover from a third party who is responsible through negligence or other wrongdoing for a covered person's injuries that result in a claim payment. If a covered person receives a settlement from the third party (or their liability insurance company) for medical expenses that the plan has already paid, the covered person must reimburse the plan. The plan also has the right to seek a recovery from the party at fault for benefits paid if the person who receives benefits does not take legal action.\n"

Few employers undertake paying claims themselves, and most fully insured plans\n(see KB-1 Topic 460) delegate claim processing to the insurer.\n   HMOs and PPOs. HMOs do not require patients to fill out forms to claim benefits because all benefits are prepaid by the monthly premium cost. In addition, some PPOs require providers to submit claims directly to the claim processor. For example, an employee might be billed a small copayment at the time of an office visit and not be required to file a benefit claim. This occurs because the provider agreed to accept as full payment the reimbursement from the sponsor of the PPO.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 515 - Health Benefits - Health Plan Administration - Benefit Denial Procedures\n\n   There are many reasons why a claim might be denied. For example, the services may not be covered by the benefit plan. Another common reason for denial is that the treatment is experimental. The plan maximum benefit level may have been reached. The individual may not be eligible under the plan because he or she has not worked for the employer for the required number of days. Denial can also occur when the claimant has a preexisting condition that precludes coverage until a specified exclusion period has passed.\n   If a claim is denied. When a claim is denied, the plan administrator must provide the claimant with the reasons for denial in easy-to-understand language. The plan administrator must explain the information needed to perfect the claim, cite the plan provisions on which the denial was based, and detail the procedure for appealing the claim decision (Reference 1 below).\n   Ultimately, a participant may initiate a lawsuit to decide whether the plan should pay a claim. Depending on the amount of discretion accorded the administrator in interpreting a claim, the court could decide whether the denial of benefits constituted an abuse of discretion or review the facts de novo and make a decision on coverage (see KB-1 Topic 55).\n   For a detailed discussion of the benefit claims procedure, see KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nSupreme Court decisions\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that ERISA did not preempt an Illinois law allowing for an independent external review to resolve disputes over the \"medical necessity\" of medical treatments that a patient's primary care doctor has recommended (Reference 3 below). The end result of the Court's decision is that state independent review laws will control, as long as they don't create a new cause of action or provide a remedy beyond the benefits otherwise available under a plan.\n   The Supreme Court also has held that a Texas state law, the Texas Health Care Liability Act (fHCLA), was preempted by ERISA where two HMO participants sought recovery under the THCLA for their HMOs' refusal to provide certain treatment and services recommended by their doctors. The claims were only to rectify wrongful benefits denials; they did not arise independently of ERISA or the plans' terms. Because the claims were pure eligibility decisions, ERISA, not state law, provided the exclusive remedy (Reference 4 below).\n \nInterpretation of eligible expenses\n   In the process of paying or denying a claim, the administrator should differentiate expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from those that are not allowed under the plan. While many employers adopt many of the same plan provisions and follow state or federal laws that apply to the plans, each employer does have discretion in designing the welfare benefit plan that it offers to employees. Therefore, the claim payer must be able to identify each employer's plan and the specific provisions of the plan to identify eligible expenses.\n   Just because a charge is eligible for payment does not mean that the plan will reimburse for it. Charges that are not allowed should neither be reimbursed nor applied toward satisfaction of the deductible.\n   Pointer: The plan document should specify and define noncovered expenses so that the administrator, utilization reviewers, the employer, and participants can all clearly understand types of charges that the plan will not allow.\n   Payments that were wrongfully made by an administrator may be recovered under ERISA and claims fraudulently submitted may be denied payment.\n\nFor more information...\n   Claim procedure requirements under ERISA are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n   An ERISA-required review after a benefit denial is analyzed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n   Claim procedure requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are discussed at KB-1 Topic 934.\n\nFor more information ...\n   A discussion of possible reasons for denial of a medical claim is located at KB-1 Topic 10,425 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f) and (g).\n3 Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

(Reference 1 below)\n\nStandards of review\n\tIn reviewing a benefit denial under ERISA's civil enforcement standards, a court can consider the case anew from the beginning on its merits in what is called de novo review.\n\tHowever, where a plan gives the administrator or fiduciary the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan, a court needs only to determine whether the actions of the plan administrator were arbitrary and capricious.(Reference 2 below)\n\t\nSupreme Court rejection of deference exceptions. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that where a company's plan provisions gave the plan administrator the power to construe disputed terms, a federal district court should have deferred to the administrator's reasonable interpretation of disputed provisions.(Reference 3 below)\n\nArbitrary and capricious standard\nIn determining whether a fiduciary's actions were arbitrary and capricious, courts generally have considered whether\n\t1. the fiduciary acted rationally or reasonably;\n\t2. there was fraud or bad faith;\n\t3. there was a consistent application of the terms of the plan or ERISA; or\n\t4. the fiduciary's actions were based on substantial evidence.\n\nPointer: The provision of adequate notice prior to a fiduciary's exercise of discretionary authority might be considered relevant to a determination of arbitrariness.\nAn employee benefit plan that gave different reasons for denying benefits to a plan beneficiary at each stage of review failed to comply with requirements under ERISA.(Reference 4 below) The court found that the plan's denial had been arbitrary and capricious.\n\nReview of conflict-of-interest cases\n\tA plan administrator that both evaluates and pays benefits claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionai:y benefit determinations, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.(Refernce 5 below)\n\tThe conflict does not change the standard of review of a benefits denial from deferential to de novo, but the conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. \n\tA conflict of interest should prove more important where there is a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, such as where an insurance company administrator has a histoi:y of biased claims administration. \n\tThe conflict would prove less important, the court explained, where an administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\n\nFor more information ...\nThe standards of judicial review following a denial of benefits are discussed in greater detail at KB-1 Topic 130,090 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\nCivil enforcement under ERISA is discussed at KB-1 Topic 55.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1 Kinkead v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 45 - Basics of ERISA - Benefit Claims Procedures - Claims Procedures for Welfare Benefit Plans\n    Every welfare benefit plan must establish a claims procedure to process claims for benefits made by participants and beneficiaries. The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has issued regulations that provide new standards for processing claims under group health and group disability plans.\n    In July, 2010, the IRS, EBSA, and the HHS issued interim final regulations that added a number of requirements for internal claims procedures and appeals. The new rules implement the claims appeals requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111-148). These ACA changes are effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, though the Labor Department has provided for a grace period. Claims procedures under health reform are discussed at r 934\n    A plan that denies a claim for plan benefits must give the claimant adequate written notice of the denial. The claimant must also receive a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial (Reference 1 below).\n    The rules for filing a claim must be described in the summary plan description (SPD) (see r 110). A poorly written SPD that does not clearly specify a time limit for claims may excuse an employee from meeting the deadline (Reference 2 below).\n    The Eleventh Circuit has ruled that relevant medical records do not have to be supplied to a participant until after the decision to grant or deny a disability benefits claim has been made (Reference 3 below).\n\nNecessary information\n    A notice of a claim denial must state, in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the claimant, the following information:\n1. The specific reasons for the denial of the claim;\n2. A specific reference to the pertinent plan provision on which the denial is based;\n3. A description of any additional material or information that is necessary for a claimant to perfect the claim;\n4. An explanation of why the additional material or information needed to perfect the claim is necessary; and\n5. A description of the steps necessary (i.e., the appeals procedure) if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.\n    Pointer: If a participant brings a lawsuit claiming that an administrator's decision to deny benefits was made in bad faith, the fact that an administrator can show that these procedures were adhered to could help the administrator avoid liability for punitive damages (Reference 4 below).\n\nAdministrator as fiduciary\n    When a plan administrator denies a participant's claim for benefits, the administrator is acting as a fiduciary and so must meet the rules governing the conduct of fiduciaries.\n\nDisability benefit claims\n    At the initial level, disability claims must be resolved within 45 days of receipt. A plan may extend the decision-making period for an additional 30 days for reasons beyond the control of the plan. If, after this first extension, the plan administrator determines that it will still be unable, again for reasons beyond the control of the plan, to make a decision, the plan may extend decision-making for a second 30-day period.\n    During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan. Reviews of disability claim denials must be completed within 45 days of receipt of the claimant's request for review by the plan. Plans providing disability benefits may extend the decision\u00admaking time on review for an additional 45-day period if the plan administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim (Reference 5 below).\n    Final disability claims regs EBSA has issued final regulations that would enhance existing disability benefit claims procedures under ERISA Sec.503 (Reference 6 below). Note, however, that the Labor Department delayed the applicability date of these regulations until April 1, 2018, for ERISA plans to comply with a final rule amending the claims procedure requirements applicable to disability benefits. In issuing these regulations, EBSA hopes to apply to disability benefits many of the claims procedural protections and safeguards that have been applied to group health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The purpose of the regulation would improve the current procedural protections for workers who become disabled and make claims for disability benefits from an employee benefit plan.\n    \nThe regulations make the following major changes to the internal claims procedures for disability plans:\n claims and appeals must be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making the benefit determination;\n benefit denial notices must contain a complete discussion of why the plan denied the claim and the standards applied in reaching the decision, including the basis for disagreeing with the views of health care professionals, vocational professionals, or with disability benefit determinations by the Social Security Administration (SSA);\n claimants must be given timely notice of their right to access to their entire claim file and other relevant documents and be guaranteed the right to present evidence and testimony in support of their claim during the review process;\n claimants must be given notice and a fair opportunity to respond before denials at the appeals stage are based on new or additional evidence or rationales;\n plans cannot prohibit a claimant from seeking court review of a claim denial based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the plan if the plan failed to comply with the claims procedure requirements unless the violation was the result of a minor error;\n certain rescissions of coverage are to be treated as adverse benefit determinations triggering the plan's appeals procedures; and\n required notices and disclosures issued under the claims procedure regulation must be written in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.\n\n  Conflicts of interest. The final rule requires that decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or similar matters with respect to any individual must not be made based upon the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of disability benefits. For example, a plan cannot provide bonuses based on the number of denials made by a claims adjudicator. Similarly, a plan cannot contract with a medical expert based on the expert's reputation for outcomes in contested cases, rather than base on the expert's professional qualifications.\n  Right to appoint representative. The claims procedure of an ERISA-covered plan cannot \"preclude an authorized representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.\" In addition, prior department guidance on the claims procedure regulation confirms that authorized representatives are entitled to notifications in connection with initial claim determinations and appeals. Although a plan may establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant, the procedure cannot prevent claimants from choosing for themselves who will act as their representative or preclude them from designating an authorized representative for the initial claim, an appeal of an adverse benefit determination, or both. The plan must include any procedures for designating authorized representatives in the plan's claims procedures and in the plan's summary plan description (SPD) or a \nseparate document that accompanies the SPD. SPDs must satisfy the style and format requirements for SPDs in ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2520.102-2, and include a statement that the plan's claims procedures are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document (Reference 7 below).\n\n  Disclosure requirements. Under the final disability claims regulations, benefit denial notices must contain a more complete discussion of why the plan denied a claim and the standards used in making the decision. For example, the notices must include a discussion of the basis for disagreeing with a disability determination made by the SSA if presented by the claimant in support of his or her claim. Also, benefit denial notices must include a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, the entire claim file and other relevant documents.\n Benefit denial notices also have to include the internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the plan that were used in denying a claim or a statement that none were used. Currently, instead of including these internal rules and protocols, benefit denial notices have the option of including a statement that such rules and protocols were used in denying the claim and that a copy will be provided to the claimant upon request.\n\n  Deemed exhaustion. If plans do not adhere to all disability claims processing rules, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, unless the violation was the result of a minor error and other specified conditions are met. If the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, the claim or appeal is deemed denied on review without the exercise of discretion by a fiduciary and the claimant may immediately pursue his or her claim in court. The final rule also provides that the plan must treat a claim as re-filed on appeal upon the plan's receipt of a court's decision rejecting the claimant's request for review.\n  Coverage rescissions. Rescissions of coverage, including retroactive terminations due to alleged misrepresentation of fact (e.g. errors in the application for coverage) must be treated as adverse benefit determinations, thereby triggering the plan's appeals procedures. Rescissions for non-payment of premiums are not covered by this provision.\n  Culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The disability claims final rule requires that benefit denial notices have to be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner in certain situations. The final rule essentially adopts the ACA standard for group health benefit notices. Specifically, if a disability claimant's address is in a county where 10 percent or more of the population is literate only in the same non-English language, benefit denial notices must include a prominent statement in the relevant non-English language about the availability of language services. The plan would also be required to provide a verbal customer assistance process in the non-English language and provide written notices in the non-English language upon request.\n\nTiming of group health plan claims\n   Decisions on urgent health care claims must be made within 72 hours from the time the claim is made. There is also a 72-hour limit for decisions on appeals of denials of urgent care claims. For decisions on non-urgent claims, the regulations make a distinction between pre-service claims (group health claims that involve access to medical care) and post-service claims (claims that involve purely the payment or reimbursement of costs for medical care that has already been provided). The regulations require that pre-service claims be decided within a maximum of 15 days at the initial level, and 30 days on review of an adverse benefit determination. Decisions on post-service claims are subject to a maximum time period of 30 days for the initial decision and a maximum of 60 days on review of a denied claim (Reference 8 below).\n   During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan.\n   Notice requirements. The regulations create notice requirements in certain circumstances. In situations involving pre-service claims, plans will be required to provide a notice informing claimants that they failed to properly file a claim, if such is the case. However, this requirement will only be triggered by a communication from a claimant or a health care professional representing the claimant, and the notice may be provided orally unless requested in writing.\n   The regulations require that a plan inform a claimant of any protocol that was relied upon in denying a claim, and either supply the relevant protocol with the notice of denial or inform the claimant of its availability from the plan upon request and free of charge. Also, notifications of claim denials based on medical necessity, experimental treatment, or other similar exclusions or limits must either explain the scientific judgment of the plan or include a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request (Reference 9 below).\n   Appeal of claim denials. Claimants must be afforded 180 days in which to bring an appeal of a denied claim. The review must be conducted by a fiduciary who is neither the party who made the initial adverse determination nor a subordinate of that party (Reference 10 below). A plan administrator's affirmance of the denial of disability benefits in a first-level internal appeal is not an \"adverse benefit determi\u00ad nation\" and, as such, an ERISA plan is not required to provide a claimant with at least 180 days to file a mandatory second appeal (Reference 11 below).\n   The fiduciaries who review a claim denial that is based on a medical judgment must consult with a health care professional with appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the claim. The consultant must also be independent of any health care professional consulted in making the initial adverse benefit determination in that the reviewer must be different from, and not subordinate to, the individual involved in the initial determination. The reviewer need not be unaffiliated with the health plan in question.\n\nAppeals process under ACA\n   Under health reform legislation, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims (see KB-1 Topic 934).\n \nFor more information ...\n   Rules governing fiduciary responsibility are discussed beginning at r 25. Judicial review of a benefit denial is discussed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 ERISA Sec. 503(I).\n2 Dodson v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society, CA-8, (1997).\n3 Glazer v.

Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 430 - Health Benefits - Health Delivery Systems - Factors in Selecting an HMO or PPO\n    Employers generally select HMOs or PPOs based on the preferences of their employees; hospitals and physicians who are affiliated with the managed care organization; financial stability; cost; cooperation; geographic locations; service areas; and reputations for quality.\n    As a result of increasing administration and financial difficulties of certain organizations, however, employers are becoming more selective in sponsoring HMOs and PPOs. Employers understand the strategic place that managed care offerings can provide for employees, but they are also aware of the effect HMOs and PPOs can have on the indemnity plan population and its costs. Employers are increasingly averse to accepting poor service, inadequate quality measures, or risky financial positions from their managed care providers.\n\nRating options\n    Pricing of an HMO or PPO can involve experience rating or else some form of community rating.\n    Experience rating. Experience rating is an insurance concept that determines premium rates or estimates claim costs based on the specific experience of one employer, rather than on the experience of all enrollees in a managed care organization. Preferred provider organizations use this rating method.\n    HMOs have not been allowed to take advantage of experience rating in pricing employer plans, but rather have been bound by the traditional community rating method under which rates can vary only as a result of a member's family size, but do not vary from employer to employer. Premiums are calculated based on the prior costs for the HMO, while considering changes in enrollment or demographics, and including inflation. Rates quoted are considered to represent the cost the employer could expect to pay for each person who enrolls regardless of that person's actual claim cost experience. Should actual costs exceed the pre\u00ad mium, the HMO, not the employer, is at risk. Conversely, should costs be less than the premium, the HMO does not return the difference in premium. In other words, the HMO's community rates represent a fully insured premium that is prepaid for each enrollee.\n    Community rating. Community rating by group is a second method of developing prepaid monthly premium costs that allows some price variation by predetermined factors such as age or sex. This method permits an HMO to use actual demographics of a group and develop rates that would apply only to that one group.\n    Adjusted community rating. A third rating method, known as adjusted community rating or group-specific rating, allows the HMO to consider experience for employers with over 100 employees (though smaller groups can sometimes use this as well). If used, this method must be disclosed to employers, consistently applied across all groups, and approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To be eligible, groups must have received services from the HMO for at least one year.\n\nFor more information ...\n    A detailed discussion on choosing an HMO or PPO is available at KB-1 Topic 12,040 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 884 - Health Care Reform - Group Market Rules - Coverage for Adult Children\n\n    A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance that provides dependent coverage of children must continue to make health coverage available for an adult child until the child turns 26 years old. Health plans or health insurers are not, however, required to cover a child of the adult child receiving dependent coverage (Reference 1 below).\n    In a separate change made by the ACA, the tax exclusion for employer\u00adprovided health benefits has been extended to include an adult child \"who as of the end of the taxable year has not attained age 27\" (also see KB-1 Topic 956) (Reference 2 below).\n    A child includes a son, daughter, stepchild, adopted child, or eligible foster child (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: The exclusion applies only for reimbursements for medical care of individuals who are not age 27 or older at any time during the taxable year. For example, a child born on Dec. 10, 1992, attains age 27 on Dec. 10, 2019. For this individual, the tax exclusion is available only through 2018. Employers may rely on the employee's representation as to the child's date of birth (Reference 4 below).\n    Restrictions on plan definition of dependent. Group health plans may not use student status, residency, or financial support from a parent to deny or restrict dependent coverage to children (Reference 5 below). Examples of factors that cannot be used for defining dependent for purposes of eligibility (or continued eligibility) include:\n\u2022 financial dependency on the participant or primary subscriber (or any other person),\n\u2022 residency with the participant or primary subscriber (or any other person),\n\u2022 student status,\n\u2022 employment,\n\u2022 eligibility for other coverage,\n\u2022 living, working or residing in an HMO's service area or other network service area (for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017);\n\u2022 marital status, or\n\u2022 any combination of these factors.\n    Example: A group health plan offers a choice of self-only or family health coverage. Dependent coverage is provided under family health coverage for children of participants who have not attained age 26. The plan imposes an additional premium surcharge for children who are older than age 18.\n    The plan violates the age rule because the plan varies the terms for dependent coverage of children based on age.\n    The age rule does not prohibit distinctions based upon age that apply to all coverages under the plan, including coverage for employees and spouses as well as dependent children.\n    Example: A group health plan normally charges a copayment for physician visits that do not constitute preventive services. The plan charges this copayment to individuals age 19 and over, including employees, spouses, and dependent children, but waives it for those under age 19 (Reference 6 below).\n    The copayments charged to dependent children are the same as those charged to employees and spouses. Accordingly, the arrangement does not violate the age rule (Reference 7 below).\n    Effects on Code Sec. 125 plans and HRAs. Code Sec. 125 cafeteria plan regulations currently do not permit election changes for children younger than age 27 who are not the employee's dependents. The IRS intends to amend IRS Reg. \u00a7 1.125-4, effective retroactively to March 30, 2010, to include change-in-status events affecting nondependent children younger than age 27, including becoming newly eligible for coverage or eligible for coverage beyond the date on which the child otherwise would have lost coverage (Reference 8 below).\n    The same rules for an employee's child younger than age 27 apply to a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), an arrangement that is paid for solely by an employer (not through a Code Sec. 125 plan) and which reimburses an employee for medical care expenses up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period.\n    VEBAs, Sec. 401(h) accounts, and Code Sec. 162(1) deductions. The same general rules for providing a tax exclusion to children younger than age 27 also apply to the following provisions (Reference 9 below):\n\u2022 voluntary employee beneficiary associations (VEBAs) providing for the payment of sick and accident benefits to members;\n\u2022 Code Sec. 401(h) accounts that provide for the payment of benefits for sickness, accident, hospitalization, and medical expenses; and\n\u2022 Code Sec. 162(1), which allows self-employed individuals to deduct amounts paid during the taxable year for insurance that constitutes medical care.\n    Retiree-only plan or excepted benefits. The health reform provisions extending health coverage to adult children under age 26 do not apply to retiree-only plans or excepted benefits. Excepted benefits generally include dental-only and vision-only plans, most health flexible spending arrangements, Medigap policies, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage (Reference 10 below).\n    Comment: HSA distributions for covered dependents. Because the ACA did not amend Code Sec. 223, which governs HSAs, it appears that HSAs cannot reimburse medical expenses for adult children on a tax-free basis unless the child otherwise qualifies as a tax dependent of the account holder (in other words, the law before health reform). Any HSA reimbursements for medical expenses of adult children would be treated as nonqualified reimbursements subject to income inclusion and penalties, which increased from 10% to 20% in 2011.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nl PHSA \u00a7 2714.\t\t\n2 Code Sec. 105(b).\n3 Code Sec. 152(f).\t\t\n4 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n5 Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2714(b).\n6 Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2714(e).\n7 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Implementation Part V, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq\u00adaca5.html.\n8 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n9 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n10 Preamble to regulations issued jointly by EBSA, IRS, and HHS (75 FR 34538), June 17, 2010.\n"

In addition, a time limit sometimes exists within which the plan beneficiary must report the child's birth to the insurance company or administrator.\n\n\tPointer: These are minimum levels.

Some states have also mandated coverage for adopted children and when this coverage must begin.\n\n\tCessation of coverage. Coverage for dependents often ends at a designated time or age (such as age 18). Often, the coverage can be extended (such as to age 25) if the dependent is a full-time student. \n\tNote that under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance that provides dependent coverage \n\tof children must continue to make health coverage available for an adult child until the child turns 26 years old regardless of student status.(Reference 1 below)\n \n\tSome states require coverage for dependents who remain dependent for a longer period (for example, children who are physically or mentally disabled). An annual or biannual verification requirement might be imposed.\n\n\tPointer: Because most states do not recognize domestic partners as legal dependents, the state mandates relating to dependents do not necessarily apply to domestic partners.\n\nFederal mandates\n\n\tERISA imposes several mandatory coverage rules relating to children on group health plans.\n\t\n\tAdopted children. Group health plans must provide coverage for adopted children in the same manner as coverage is provided for natural children.(Reference 2 below)\n\t\n\tPediatric vaccines.

To offset the cost of the higher attained age premiums of the new LTC plan and to recognize that the insured has contributed to a LTC insurance plan, the active life reserves that the insured has accumulated will be transferred to the new plan, if the insured decides to transfer. Transferring the reserves enables the new LTC plan to reduce premiums for the transferee by subtracting a discount from the insured's attained age premiums or allows the LTC plan to use the insured's original issue age under their prior plan when setting premium rates.\n\n              The insurer(s) and the employer will need to negotiate the terms of the transfer, such as who is eligible to transfer, what type of underwriting is to be used, and how the new premiums will be calculated. Transfers and upgrades require a considerable amount of administrative effort, including a customized premium quote for the new plan, the tracking of who has elected to transfer, and, for a transfer between insurers, the reconciliation of the final transfer list between insurers. Thus, a transfer provision is often included only in larger employer LTC insurance policies.\n"

Employers may use an issuer-based enrollment approach, allowing SHOPs to eliminate the online enrollment process. Employers may enroll directly with an exchange-registered agent, broker, or issuer.(Reference 2 below)\n\n\tAs of January 1, 2018, SHOPs are no longer required to provide employee eligibility, premium aggregation, or online enrollment functionality. CMS concluded that the ACA does not require SHOPs to fulfill these functions. The federally facilitated SHOP will cease doing so, although state-based SHOPs have the flexibility to continue operating as they choose in accordance with federal law. SHOPs will, under the new rules, continue to certify QHPs for sale through the SHOP, operate a website that displays and provides QHP information, provide a premium calculator that generates estimated QHP prices, and offer a call center to answer questions about the SHOP.\n\n\tEligibility standards.

For plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, when joining the SHOP, a qualified employer must comply with certain requirements, processes, and timelines and must remain in compliance for the duration of the employer's participation in the SHOP.(Reference 7 below)\n \n\tA qualified employer participating in the SHOP must disseminate information to its qualified employees about the process to enroll in a QHP through the SHOP. The information disseminated by qualified employers should include at least the timeframes for enrollment, instructions for how to access the SHOP website and other tools to compare QHPs, and the SHOP toll-free hotline.(Reference 8 below)\n\n\tQualified employers must provide employees hired outside of the initial or annual open enrollment period with a specified period to seek coverage in a QHP beginning on the first day of employment and information about the enrollment process.\n\n\tQualified employers participating in the SHOP must provide the SHOP with information about individuals or employees whose eligibility status for coverage purchased through the employer in the SHOP has changed, including: (1) newly eligible individuals and employees; and (2) loss of qualified employee status.\n\n\tQualified employers must define a percentage contribution toward premiums for employee-only coverage and, if they are offering dependent coverage, they also must define a percentage contribution toward premiums for that.(Reference 9 below)\n\n\tEnrollment of employees into QHPs under SHOP.

The employer agrees to maintain a certain contribution schedule on a monthly basis to a trust or bank account and funds any differences on a short-term basis (two to three days).\n    The insurer acts as a claims administrator and there is a stop-loss cap on liability. If an employer is unable to fund monies due on short notice, the insurer pays the difference and the plan reverts to a fully insured basis.\n    This format provides employers with some of the financial flexibility of self\u00adinsurance and the protection of a fully insured arrangement. There are no state premium taxes on the self-insured portions unless the contributions become insur\u00ad ance premiums.\n    If the insurer steps in, however, the costs will be higher than for a normal fully\u00adinsured plan.\n"

In some cases, however, employers may contribute a portion of the premium.\n\tAlthough employees' policies are underwritten individually, premium savings of 10 percent to 15 percent are possible versus comparable private insurance. Of course, the actual discount per employee varies, depending on the insurer and on each employee's own risk factors.\n\tClaims administration under group auto insurance generally is handled by the insurer.\n\tCaution: To protect themselves from potential liability, employers should include a provision in the plan holding themselves harmless in case a dispute arises between the employee and the insurer.\n\nAdvantages\n\tBoth employees and employers can benefit from group auto insurance. Employees benefit through discounted auto insurance rates. They also benefit from the convenience of making their auto insurance premium payments through payroll deductions.\n\tFor employers, group auto insurance can be a low-cost part of the benefit package offered to employees. However, it may not be suitable for all employers, such as those with high turnover rates.\n\tPointer: A person who participates in group auto insurance is not barred from maintaining a medical savings account (see KB-1 Topic 450).\n\nTax treatment\n\tBecause group auto insurance does not have tax-favored status, unlike premiums paid for employees' medical and health insurance, any premiums paid by companies for their employees' auto insurance are taxable to those employees as income.\n\tFrom the company's standpoint, any auto insurance premiums paid by companies for their employees are tax deductible by the employer.\n\tPointer: Companies that are interested in providing a particular type of auto insurance program for their employees should check to see what plans have been approved under their state insurance laws arid regulations.\n\nFor more information ...\n\tFor a detailed discussion of other types of voluntary benefits, see KB-1 Topic 1907.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 12 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - LTC Pricing\n                LTC insurance is priced on a scale of premiums that varies by issue age and plan design selected. The intent is that the premium rates remain level for the insured's lifetime, although rates are not guaranteed. If actual and expected experience differs from the actuarial pricing assumptions used to price the LTC insurance, the policyholder may be subjected to a rate increase.\n\n                Most LTC insurance sold as an employee benefit is issued to people in their 40s and 50s, while the expected claims will not occur until people are in their 70s, or older. Therefore, the pricing actuary must develop an assumed set of claim costs over the insured's lifetime. These claim costs are based upon plan design, sex, issue age, type of underwriting, and other potential factors, such as marital status. Significant additional assumptions include the expected rate of return on invested assets, lapse rates, mortality rates, administrative expenses, taxes, and risk charges. The long time frame over which pricing assumptions must be made presents significant challenges for the actuary. In other words, a relatively small deviation in these pricing assumptions relative to actual experience can result in a large difference in the level of required premium. Thus, it is prudent to conservatively set these pricing assumptions. This process is sometimes referred to as including \"provisions for adverse deviations\" (PADs). In fact, the pricing actuary is required to certify to state regulators that the premium rate schedule is sufficient to cover anticipated costs under moderately adverse experience.\n\n                The \"level\" premium structure of LTC insurance is different from the premium structure of most other employee benefits, where the premium is expected to change each year. Since premiums are designed to remain level as the insured person ages, while their expected level of claims increases, the premium must be set at a level that is higher than expected claims in the early years of coverage, so that sufficient funds are available to pay claims in the later years of coverage. The pattern of premiums and claims by age is illustrated in Figure 12-1 for a person who buys LTC insurance at age 40.\n\n\nFIGURE\t12\u00b71\nPremium and Claims by Age for Issue Age 40\n\n\n                Note that, until around age 66, this person will be paying more in premium than the insurer expects to pay out in claims. Some of this \"excess\" premium is needed to pay for administration expenses and taxes, but most will be set aside to pay future claims and is referred to as \"active life reserves\". These active life reserves are set aside and invested by the insurer, so that they will be available in the later policy years when expected claims are higher than expected premium."

A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"

HSAs are designed as successors to Archer MSAs, which are briefly discussed later, and the two have many features in common. However, they also have some notable differences that make HSAs more attractive than Archer MSAs and available to a much larger pool of consumers.\n\n\tHSAs were allowed as early as 2004. Various surveys indicate that by 2009 there were 6 to 7 million people with high-deductible health plans that met the criteria for them to also have HSAs. About three-quarters of these people have such health plans through employer-provided medical expense arrangements, but only about half of this group have either established HSAs or had their employers establish HSAs for them.\n\nGeneral Nature\n\n\tAn HSA is a personal savings account from which unreimbursed medical expenses, including deductibles, percentage participation, and copayments, can be paid. The HSA must be in the form of a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established in conjunction with a high-deductible health (medical expense) plan. An HSA is established with a qualified trustee or custodian in much the same way that an IRA is established. Any insurance company or bank (as well as certain other financial institutions) can be a trustee or custodian, as can any other person or entity already approved by the IRS as a trustee or custodian for IRAs.\n\n\tHSAs are individual trusts, which prohibits a husband and wife from having a joint HSA. But as long as both are eligible, each may have a separate HSA.\n\n\tSome insurers that sell high-deductible health plans for use with HSAs also market the HSA accounts; other insurers leave it to the purchasers of a high-deductible health plan to establish their HSAs with other institutions.\n\n\tEven though employers can sponsor HSAs, these accounts are established for the benefit of individuals and are portable. If an employee changes employers or leaves the workforce, the HSA, including the balance in the account, remains with the individual.\n\nEligibility\n\n\tEmployees, the self-employed, and anyone else can establish HSAs as long as they meet the following rules for qualification:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual must be covered by a high-deductible health plan. That plan may be insured or self-insured if offered by an employer as long as it meets the criteria for a qualifying high-deductible plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual is not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person's federal income tax return.\n\n\t\t\u2022 With some exceptions, a person who is covered under a high-deductible health plan is denied eligibility for an HSA if he or she is covered under another health plan that does not meet the definition of a high-deductible plan but that provides any benefits that are covered under the high-deductible health plan. The exceptions include coverage for accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care as well as liability insurance, insurance for a specified disease or illness, and insurance paying a fixed amount per period of hospitalization. Participation in a typical FSA would make an individual ineligible to participate in an HSA unless the FSA only provided reimbursement for types of expenses not covered under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\n\tAn employer can establish HSAs for its employees, or an individual (whether employed or not) may establish his or her own HSA.\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plan\n\n\tFor purposes of HSA participation, a high-deductible health plan is defined as having the following deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limitations for covered services. These figures are for 2012 and subject to annual inflation adjustments:\n\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of self-only coverage, the deductible must be at least $1,200, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $6,050.\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $12,100.\n\n\tIf these high-deductible plans use preferred-provider networks, they can have higher out-of-pocket limits for services provided outside the network, and any deductibles for nonnetwork services are not taken into account when determining the out-of-pocket limits specified above.\n\n\tOne point should be emphasized about the deductible for family coverage. It is not a family deductible as was described in the discussion on major medical insurance. In that situation, there is an individual deductible that\napplies to each family member as well as a separate deductible for the family. This is sometimes referred to as an embedded deductible, and the policy pays benefits for any family member once his or her deductible is satisfied, even if the family deductible is not yet met.\n\n\tIn the case of a high-deductible policy used with an HSA, there will usually not be an individual deductible if a policy is written for a family. Rather, there will be a single deductible-referred to as a common deductible-that must be satisfied before any benefits are payable, even if all claims are for one family member. It is permissible, however, to use an embedded deductible, but only if the individual deductible is equal to at least the required HSA family deductible of $2,400.\n\n\tThe following incurred expenses do not count toward the plan's required deductible and out-of-pocket limit:\n\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services not covered by the high-deductible health plan\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services received from nonnetwork health care providers, if the plan uses a preferred-provider network\n\t\t\u2022 amounts above a plan's reasonable allowable specific service maximums\n\t\t\u2022 amounts in excess of reasonable and customary fees \n\t\t\u2022 penalties for failure to obtain a plan-required certification\n\n\tNevertheless, copayments and required percentage participation count toward the out-of-pocket limit, even if the plan does not consider them as contributing toward the satisfaction of the deductible. In addition, the deductible amount counts towards the out-of-pocket limit. However, employee contributions paid for the coverage do not count.\n\nPreventive Care\n\n\tGenerally, a high-deductible health plan established in conjunction with an HSA cannot provide benefits before the deductible is satisfied, but there is an exception for benefits for preventive care. A high-deductible health plan may provide benefits for the following preventive care services before the insured satisfies the plan's required high deductible:\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual physicals, immunizations, and screening services\n\n\t\t\u2022 routine prenatal and well-child care\n\n\t\t\u2022 tobacco cessation programs and obesity weight-loss programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 employee-assistance, disease management, or wellness programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 treatment of a related condition that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive care service or screening, such as removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy\n\n\t\t\u2022 drugs or medications taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease before the disease manifests itself or to prevent the reoccurrence of a disease from which the person has recovered. An example is the drug treatment of high cholesterol to prevent heart disease, or the treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with medications to prevent a recurrence. Other prescription drugs that do not qualify under this exception remain subject to the plan's high deductible.\n\nPreventive care must be offered with no cost-sharing.\n\nContributions\n\n\tContributions to an HSA may be made solely by individuals who have such accounts. They may also be made by employers that provide their employees with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIndividual Contributions\n\n\tIndividuals often fund HSAs without employer contributions because they are not employees or because their employer makes no contribution to HSAs. Contributions must be in the form of cash, and they are deductible for federal income tax purposes even if the individual does not itemize deductions.\n\n\tThe maximum annual contribution to an HSA in 2012 is $3,100 if the account holder has self-only coverage and $6,250 if the account holder has family coverage. These amounts are subject to annual indexing for inflation. As a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the full maximum contribution is allowed even if it exceeds the policy deductible amount under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\tIf both a husband and wife establish an HSA and have family coverage (that is, a single policy covering both of them), they can allocate the maximum contribution in any way they determine. If they have separate policies, each is subject to the limits that apply to self-only coverage.\n\n\tIndividuals aged 55 or older are also permitted an additional annual catch-up contribution of up to $1,000. If both a husband and wife are aged 55 or older, the catch-up contribution is available to each of them only if they have separate HSAs.\n\n\tAnnual contributions can be made in a lump sum or spread out over time. However, the contributions for a specific tax year cannot be made before the tax year begins or after the taxpayer's original filing date (without extensions) for that tax year. For most individuals, this is the earlier of April 15 of the following year or the date a return is filed. This is similar to the rules for IRA contributions.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJack and Eva, a married couple, retired last year when they each reached age 56. They purchased a family medical expense policy with a $5,000 deductible, and Jack established an HSA. The maximum contribution to the HSA for 2012 is $7,250, which consists of the regular $6,250 limit and an additional catch-up amount of $1,000 for Jack.\n\n\tHowever, i\u00a3 they each established an HSA, they both would be eligible to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution to their own accounts. The$6,250 regular contribution could be allocated between the two accounts as they agree upon. The net effect is that the total HSA contributions would increase to $8,250.\n\n\tThey can make these contributions in one or more payments between January 1, 2012 and the date they file their 2012 tax return.\n\n\tIf an individual stops participating in an HSA during a tax year, the actual HSA contribution that can be deducted for the tax year is limited to 1/12 of the annual amount, as described previously, times the number of months that an individual is eligible for HSA participation. Until 2007, the same rule applied if an individual began participating in an HSA after January of the tax-year-only a proportionate contribution could be made. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act changed the rule as long as an individual is still eligible to participate in an HSA during the last month of a tax-year. In such a situation, the individual is allowed to make the full annual tax-deductible contribution for the year. However, if he or she fails to remain eligible for an HSA for at least 12 months thereafter (other than because of death or disability), the contribution for the prior year that is attributable to months when the account holder did not have an HSA is includible in gross income and subject to a 20 percent penalty tax.\n\n\tAn excess contribution occurs to the extent that contributions to an HSA exceed the tax-deductible limits or are made for an ineligible person. The account holder is subject to a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions (including those made by an employer) for each year these contributions are in an account. This excise tax can be avoided if the excess amount and any net income attributable to the excess amount are removed from the HSA prior to the last day prescribed by law, (including extensions) for filing the account holder's income tax return. The net income attributable to the excess contributions is included in the account holder's gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is made.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\tPaul, aged 55, is eligible for an HSA and has a self-only high-deductible policy. In January 2012, he made a contribution of $2,000 to the HSA. On July 1, Paul decided to cease being a self-employed freelance editor and become an employee of a magazine. He cancelled his previous medical expense policy and enrolled in his new employer's, which did not qualify as a high-deductible health plan. As a result, Paul's allowable HSA contribution for the year is only 6/12 of $3,000, or $1,500. He is now in the position of having made an excess contribution for the year. As long as he withdraws the other $500 plus any earnings on this amount before filing his 2012 tax return, he will avoid any adverse tax consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\tJane, aged 39, did just the opposite of Paul. She left her prior job with an employer and became a self-employed consultant. This occurred on November 1, 2012, when she dropped her former HMO coverage through the employer and purchased a high-deductible medical expense policy for herself and her son. She also established an HSA. She is eligible to make the full 2012 contribution of $6,250 and took it as a deduction on her 2012 tax return. However, if she does not continue to be covered under a high-deductible health plan through 2013, a portion of this amount will have to be included as taxable income for 2013.\n\nRoll-Over Contributions\n\n\tAn account balance from an Archer MSA can be rolled over to an HSA on a tax-free basis. Similarly, account balances from an existing HSA can be rolled over to a new HSA.\n\n\tThe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also allows certain other types of tax-free rollovers in specific circumstances. For example, an account holder who establishes an HSA is allowed a one-time rollover of funds from an HRA or health FSA. The amount of the rollover, which is in addition to any regular contribution for the year, is limited to the lesser of the balance in such an account on (1) September 21, 2006, or (2) the date of the rollover. If the account holder does not remain eligible to participate in an HSA for at least one year after the rollover, the amount of the rollover is included in income for tax purposes and subject to a penalty tax. Finally, an account holder may make a one-time-only rollover from an IRA. The amount of the rollover is limited to the tax-deductible HSA contribution for the year and reduces any regular contribution allowed.\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\n\tMany persons with HDHPs have their coverage under an employer-provided plan, and their employer may make contributions to the HSAs of employees. Employer contributions belong to the employee and are nonforfeitable. The employer might make the maximum annual contribution as previously described. However, it is also possible that the employer contribution will contribute a lower amount. In this case, an employee can make any remaining allowable contribution.\n\n\tAn employer that contributes to HSAs is subject to a nondiscrimination rule that requires the employer to make comparable contributions for all employees who have HSAs. Failure to comply with this rule subjects the employer to an excise tax. However, full-time employees and part-time employees (those working fewer than 30 hours per week) are treated separately. The comparability rule generally requires that the employer contribute either the same dollar amount for each employee or the same percentage of each employee's deductible under the health plan. However, it is permissible for an employer to make larger contributions for nonhighly-compensated employees than for highly compensated employees.\n\nHSA Account Growth\n\n\tUnused amounts in an HSA accumulate on a tax-free basis and carry over to subsequent years without limit. The size of an HSA balance carried over from prior years has no effect on a current year's contribution.\n\nDistributions from an HSA\n\n\tAn individual can usually take distributions from an HSA at any time, but the trust or custodial document may put reasonable restrictions on both the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. Generally, accounts are set up so that they can be accessed with debit cards or checks written by the account holder as an alternative to actually filing for reimbursement. The amount of the distribution can be any part or all of the account balance. Subject to some exceptions, distributions of both contributions and earnings are excludible from an account holder's gross income if used to pay medical expenses of the account holder and the account holder's legal spouse and tax dependents as long as these expenses are not paid by other sources of insurance. There is no requirement that these family members be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. If both a husband and wife have HSAs, the reimbursement for any family can come from either or both HSAs but together cannot exceed the amount of the unreimbursed expense.\n\n\tFor the most part, the eligible medical expenses are the same ones that would be deductible, ignoring the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation (10 percent in 2013), if the account holder itemized his or her income tax deductions. Tax-free withdrawals are permitted for the purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for the purchase of health coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation. They are also permitted for the purchase of long-term care insurance up to certain deductible limits. However, tax-free withdrawals are not otherwise permitted for the purchase of health insurance by persons under age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tEric has accumulated $6,000 in his HSA account during the last 3 years. Because hjs wife has medical expense coverage with her employer, Eric's high-deductible policy is for him only.\n\n\tIn February, Eric incurred his first medical expenses for the year when he severely sprained his wrist. He incurred $1,000 in medical expenses that were not covered under his policy because the $5,000 deductible had not been met. Eric can pay for these expenses with funds from his HSA.\n\n\tIn April, Eric had a routine eye examination that cost $120. This examination was not covered under his medical expense policy, but it qualifies as a medical expense for IRS purposes. Therefore, Eric can take a $120 tax-free distribution from his HSA.\n\n\tIn July, Eric's wife had a crown installed by her dentist. Her employer-provided health insurance paid only $600 of the dentist's bill. Eric can use his HSA to pay the remaining $400 because HSA funds can be used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses of an account holder's legal spouse. (Note that the IRS considers medical expenses to include charges for dental services.)\n\n\n\tEven though contributions cannot be made after an individual reaches age 65 and becomes a Medicare beneficiary, tax-free distributions can still be used for any future qualified medical expenses, which include premiums for original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage plans, and medical expense coverage under employer-sponsored plans. However, an account holder cannot use tax-free distributions to pay premiums for a Medicare supplement policy.\n\n\tFrom a financial planning standpoint, account holders may want to wait until after retirement or age 65 to take HSA distributions as long as they have the resources to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses prior to that time. This will allow their HSA balances to grow on a tax-favored basis for use in their older years when unreimbursed medical expenses may be higher and/or income may be lower.\n\n\tDistributions are permitted for other reasons, but they are subject to income taxation and possibly to a 20 percent penalty tax. However, the penalty tax does not apply in the case of distributions after an individual's death, disability, or the attainment of age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKirby has a balance of $7,000 in his HSA. At age 67, he rediscovered his childhood sweetheart and fell madly in love. She agreed to marry him and he wants to give her a big diamond ring. Because she told Kirby that she would take care of him for life, he decided to cash in his HSA and apply the proceeds to purchase the ring. His tax accountant informed Kirby that this arrangement would not be a qualified medical expense. He can withdraw the funds without penalty because he is at least age 65, but the $7,000 must be included in his gross income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\n\tFormer employees, including retirees, may continue HSAs that were established prior to termination of employment, and the rules for contributions and distributions are as previously described.\n\n\tRetirees who did not have an HSA prior to retirement can establish one at that time as long as all the proper rules are satisfied. Such an HSA may present an opportunity for a retiree to reduce income taxes. However, the requirement of having a high-deductible plan will probably negate this advantage if an individual has substantial medical expenses.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKathleen, a widow, retired at age 60 from her job as an attorney. She likes the concept of consumer-directed health plans and has decided to establish an HSA. In order to be eligible for the HSA, she purchased a major medical policy with an annual deductible of $2,500. She plans to make the maximum allowable contribution to the HSA until she is eligible for Medicare. She will then use her HSA balance to pay her Medicare premiums.\n\n\tThere are fees involved in establishing an HSA. These fees may affect any potential tax advantages if an HSA is established near the time of Medicare enrollment.\n\nEstate Tax Treatment of HSAs\n\n\tUpon death, the remaining balance in an HSA is includible in the account holder's gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the account is a surviving spouse, the HSA belongs to the spouse and he or she can deduct the account balance in determining the account holder's taxable estate. The surviving spouse can then use the HSA for his or her medical expenses. If the beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, the HSA ceases to exist, and the beneficiary must include the fair market value of the account in his or her gross income for tax purposes. If no beneficiary is named, the tax is payable by the estate or the beneficiary of the estate.\n\nEstablishing and Maintaining HSAs\n\n\tThere are a number of issues that need to be evaluated by an individual who has the option to establish an HSA. Perhaps the most important question is whether such an account is appropriate. After a person decides to establish an HSA, issues such as account fees, investment options for funds, and record keeping must be addressed.\n\nAppropriateness of HSAs\n\n\tFor some persons, an HSA is very appropriate and offers significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities. For other persons, an HSA may not be an attractive financial commitment. An HSA's viability depends on individual circumstances such as income, tax rates, the funds available to fund such an account, when account balance will be withdrawn, earnings on account funds, and account fees. Some of these issues are addressed in the following example.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJohn and his wife, both aged 50, no longer have any dependent children. They are self-employed and have a joint income of $150,000. For the last few years, they have had an HSA-compatible policy with a $5,000 deductible, but have not established HSAs. They are in good health and have paid aU unreimbursed medical expenses from current income. Their financial advisor has suggested that one or both of them should establish an HSA. They have decided to do so, and make an annual contribution of $5,000, which is an affordable financial commitment. This will result in an annual income tax savings of $1,300 (based on IRS estimates). They have also decided to continue paying any unreimbursed medical expenses from current income and to let the HSA funds accumulate until they retire at age 65. They plan on investing the funds and expect them to grow at about 5 percent per year. If this return is achieved, they will have a fund of about $100,000 when they retire. They will then withdraw amounts as needed on a tax-free basis to pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nAccount Fees\n\n\tOne factor that varies widely among financial institutions that offer HSAs is the fees that they charge. If an individual uses an HSA that has been established by his or her employer, the employer may pay some of these fees. But no matter how an account is established, a potential account holder should look at the fees and their impact on the account balance. Unfortunately, this is not always easy to do. Although financial institutions often have information about their HSAs on Web sites or in print, the fee structure is often conspicuously absent or hard to locate. Unlike other types of financial products, such as IRAs, there are no requirements to provide potential account holders with\na prospectus that details the fees. Therefore, it is often necessary to ask specific questions. As the next example demonstrates, these fees may have an effect on the decision to establish an HSA. Even if an HSA is an obvious choice, the account balance will be affected by the fee structure.\n\n\tHSA fees fall into several categories that might include one or more of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 account setup fee. This is a one-time fee to establish the HSA. Such fees typically range from $0 to $50, with $15 or $20 being common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual fee. An HSA may have an annual fee that ranges up to $200, but amounts of $10 to $20 are most common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 monthly maintenance fee. An HSA may have a monthly maintenance fee that ranges up to $10, but amounts like $2 to $3 seem most common. Although there may be both a monthly maintenance fee and an annual fee, this is very uncommon; there is usually one or the other. In either case, the amount of the fee may be lower for higher account balances.\n\n\t\t\u2022 transaction fee. An HSA may have a fee that is levied on each transaction. The fee may apply to contributions, but is most likely to be levied on withdrawals only. Fees may be as high as $5, but $.25 to $.50 are quite common. Sometimes a few transactions are allowed without a fee, but fees are levied on transactions in excess of this number.\n\n\t\t\u2022 account closing fee. It is not unusual for an HSA to have an account closing fee that can range up to $25 or $30, although $10 is a more common amount.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tAmber is an administrative assistant who earns about $40,000 annually. She has an employer-provided medical expense policy with a $2,500 deductible. Her employer has not set up HSAs for employees and makes no HSA contributions. Amber enjoys traveling and what money she has left is being saved for a new car that she hopes to buy within the next 2 years. Amber is healthy and incurs about $500 in unreimbursed medical expenses annually. This typically includes two doctor's visits and quarterly refills of a prescription drug. To minimize her taxes, Amber decides toestablish an HSA. She plans on putting the $500 into an HSA account and taking a withdrawal each time she incurs an unreimbursed medical expense. This will lower her taxes by about $75. When she looks into establishing such an account with her local bank, she finds that they have an account setup fee of $15. There is also a $2 monthly maintenance fee ($24 per year) and a $3 fee for each withdrawal ($18 for her six transactions). Therefore, she will incur expenses of $57 to save $75 the first year. When Amber finds out that her account balance will be too small to earn more than 1 percent interest, she decides that an HSA is not worth the administrative hassle for such a minimal tax savings.\n\nInvestment Options for HSA Funds\n\n\tFinancial institutions often offer several types of investment options for HSA funds. Account holders can invest HSA funds in essentially the same manner as IRA funds. Allowable investments include bank accounts, annuities, certificates of deposit, stocks, mutual funds, and bonds. Investments in life insurance policies or most types of collectibles are prohibited. In addition, an HSA trust or custodial agreement may limit the investment options available.\n\n\tAlthough mutual funds and stocks may result in the best return over a number of years, they are probably unsuitable if an account holder has modest amounts in an HSA that will be used for medical expenses in the near future. Like many types of investments, they will fluctuate in value over time. Such investments may also be unavailable unless an account holder has an account balance of several thousand dollars. The prior example regarding John under the heading Appropriateness shows when such an investment makes sense.\n\n\tIn most cases, an individual will be using some type of bank account that allows easy access to the available funds. In this case, it is important to evaluate the return that these funds will earn, which is set by each bank. In some cases, nothing is paid unless the account exceeds a minimum balance, such as $1,000. Interest rates may also vary by the size of the account's average daily balance. In still other cases, a specified interest rate, which can change, is paid on any size balance. Even with these variations, there are significant differences among banks.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\tCustodians and trustees for HSAs report the amount of annual contributions to and distributions from each HSA to the IRS. Under IRS rules, it is the account holder's responsibility to determine whether distributions from HSAs are for eligible medical expenses. Therefore, individuals who establish such accounts should maintain records in case they are audited. They should also become familiar with the types of expenses that are deductible. Guidance can be found in IRS Publication 502, which is available on the IRS Web site: irs.gov."

However, reimbursement for cosmetic surgery neces\u00ad sary to improve a congenital abnormality or injury or necessary to restore a bodily function is allowed.(Reference 2 below) Long-term care insurance provided through an FSA loses its tax-favored status (see KB-1 Topic 2623).(Reference 3 below) \n\nlist of reimbursable expenses expands\n\tIn recent years, the IRS had specifically allowed for the reimbursement of nonprescription, over-the-counter drugs (see KB-1 Topic 2253) though 2010 health reform legislation changed this rule, for purchases after December 31, 2010. In two other rulings, the IRS indicated that expenses for breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy as well as vision correction surgery, such as Lasik, are reimbursable. However, the IRS disallowed reimbursement for teeth whitening procedures.(Reference 4  below)\n\nSmoking cessation programs\n\tReversing its long-standing position, the IRS now allows the costs of smoking cessation programs and of prescription drugs designed to alleviate nicotine withdrawal to be deductible as medical expenses. As a result, expenses paid by an employee for smoking cessation programs and for prescription nicotine withdrawal drugs are reimbursable by health FSAs.(Reference 5 below)\n\nReferences:\n1 Prop.

Because several different payments contribute to TrOOP, CMS awarded a contract to NDC Health to provide coordination-of-benefits systems. NDC Health is responsible for systems that will monitor TrOOP on a pharmacy level so that beneficiaries can question their pharmacists about how close they are to catastrophic coverage. To ensure accuracy of this information, NDC Health is required to route claims for benefits paid by entities other than Medicare to the prescription drug plans. This requirement ensures that what seniors pay at pharmacies takes into account the appropriate level of their Medicare coverage.\n\n\nTABLE\t21-1\nMedicare Part D Standard Benefit Design Parameters\n\n\t\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\nAfter the deductible is met, the beneficiary pays 25% of covered costs up to total prescription costs meeting the initial coverage limit\tDeductible\t$265\t$275\t$295\t$310\t$310\nCoverage gap (donut hole) begins at this point\tInitial coverage limit\t$2,400\t$2,510\t$2,700\t$2,830\t$2,840\nIncluding the coverage gap, catastrophic coverage starts after this point\tTotal covered Part D drug out-of-pocket spending\t$5,451.25\t$5,726.25\t$6,153.75\t$6,440.00\nplus a\n$250\nbrand rebate\t$6,447.50\nplus a 50%\nbrand\ndiscount\nTrue out-of- pocket costs including\nthe donut hole (deductible+ initial coverage+ coverage gap = true out-of- pocket (TrOOP) cost)\tTrue\nout-of-pocket threshold\t$265.00\n$533.75\nSi3,051.25\t$275.00\n$558.75\nSi3,216.25\t$295.00\n$601.25\nSi3,453.75\t$310.00\n$630.00\nSi3,610.00\t$310.00\n$632.50\nSi3,607.50\n\t\t$3,850.00\t$4,050.00\t$4,350.00\t$4,550.00\t$4,550.00\n\tCatastrophic Coverage Benefit\n\tGeneric/ preferred multisource drug\t$2.15\t$2.25\t$2.40\t$2.50\t$2.50*\n\tOther drugs\t$5.35\t$5.60\t$6.00\t$6.30\t$6.30*\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Coverage is either the greater of 5%, or the values in the table above.

                    "text": "KB-3 - Taxable & Non-Taxable Employee Benefits - What about employee personal use of a company vehicle?\n\n\tPersonal use of a company-owned vehicle is considered part of an employee's taxable income and keeping accurate documentation is vital in determining what percentage of the vehicle's mileage constitutes personal use. lf you can't determine business versus personal use, the value of the vehicle would be I00%\ttaxable to the employee.\n\n\tNormally, employers must withhold employment taxes (and pay their share of those taxes). However, for federal and state income taxes, employers can choose to withhold taxes or not, but only if they notify the employee of that decision beforehand and include the value of the employee's personal use of the company vehicle in Boxes I, 3, 5 and 14 of his or her Form W-2.\n\n\tHow employers determine the value of company car usage is somewhat complicated. There are four methods available to value an employee's personal use of a company vehicle:\n\n\u2022\tGeneral valuation rule. The value is based on fair market value (FMV), defined as the amount the employee would have to pay to a third party to lease the same or similar vehicle in the same geographic area where the employee used the vehicle.\n\n\u2022\t\tCommuting valuation rule. The value is equal to the cost of each trip from home to work or work to home multiplied by $1.50. There are very strict requirements for using this method of valuation, including a written policy limiting the employee's use almost entirely to commuting to work and back.\n\n\u2022\t\tCents-per-mile. The most common method of valuation, this rule allows employers to multiply the business standard mileage rate (57.5 cents per mile less up to 5.5 cents per mile if the employer doesn't provide fuel) by the total number of miles the employee drives the vehicle for personal use.\n\nFleet average. Allows employers operating a fleet of 20 or more qualifying vehicles to use the annual lease value of the vehicle (as specified by an IRS table that bases annual lease value on a vehicle's fair market value) multiplied by the percentage of personal miles driven out of total miles driven by the employee. This amount also is subject to a fuel adjustment.\n\n\tThe cents-per-mile and fleet average methods can't be used if the FMV of the vehicle exceeded a certain base value (adjusted annually for inflation), on the first date the vehicle is made available to the employee for personal use. In general, employers that adopt the cents-per-mile rule must continue to use it for all subsequent years in which the vehicle qualifies for it. An employer can, however, use the commuting valuation rule for any year the vehicle qualifies."

                    "text": "KB-5 -   Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Claims\n\nCLAIMS\n     The handling of medical expense claims is different, depending on whether a plan provides benefits on an indemnity basis or on a service basis.\n\n      Subrogation provisions may also apply.\n\nIndemnity Benefits\n       Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on an indemnity basis typically require that the insurance company (or other provider) receive a written proof of loss (that is, a claim form) concerning the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which a covered person makes a claim. This form usually contains portions that must be completed and signed by the employee, a representative of the employer, and the provider of medical services.\n\n      The period during which an employee must file a claim depends on the provider of coverage and any applicable state requirements. An employee generally has at least 90 days (or as soon as is reasonably possible) after medical expenses are incurred to file. Some insurance companies require notification within a shorter time (such as 20 days) about any illness or injury on which a claim may be based, even though they give a longer time for the actual filing of the form itself.\n\n       Individuals have the right to assign their benefits to the providers of medical services. A covered person generally makes such an assignment, which authorizes the insurance company to make the benefit payment directly to the provider by completing the appropriate portion of the claim form. In addition, the insurance company has the right (as it does in disability income insurance) to examine any person for whom a claim is filed at its own expense and with the physician of its own choice.\n\nService Benefits\n      Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on a service basis (such as HMOs and the Blues) generally do not require that covered persons file claim forms. Rather, the providers of health care services perform any necessary paperwork and receive reimbursement directly.\n\n      For example, when a physician presents a claim, the plan must determine one or more of the following: the physician's status as a network participant; the primary or specialty care nature of the service if rendered by a network participant; and the applicability of an authorization requirement. Depending upon the plan's stringency, the provider's reimbursement may be denied altogether or be far less than the amount charged if the member receives services from a nonnetwork provider or sees a specialist without a required referral. In turn, the payment made to the provider determines whether the enrollee must pay a modest copayment, a more substantial amount under an indemnity benefit as described above, or the total amount if there is a claim denial.\n\n      Network providers with capitation payment arrangements file patient encounter forms that in effect are claims that produce no payment for a specific service.\n\nSubrogation\n       Most self-funded plans contain subrogation provisions. If state law allows, they are also commonly contained in the group medical expense contracts of HMOs, PPOs, the Blues, and insurance companies. A subrogation provision gives the plan (or the organization providing plan benefits) the right to recover from a third party who is responsible through negligence or other wrongdoing for a covered person's injuries that result in a claim payment. If a covered person receives a settlement from the third party (or their liability insurance company) for medical expenses that the plan has already paid, the covered person must reimburse the plan. The plan also has the right to seek a recovery from the party at fault for benefits paid if the person who receives benefits does not take legal action.\n"

This type of income protection is pro\u00ad vided through sick leave or sickness and accident insurance.\n\tSeveral cities and states have recently passed laws mandating that employers of certain sizes provide paid sick leave to employees. Make sure to check for any laws applicable to your city/state.\n\nConsiderations for sick leave plans\n\tSick leave plans typically specify a maximum number of benefit days per year at full pay. However, some sick leave plans provide a number of sick leave days for each disability. The number of days of annual sick leave varies from plan to plan. Factors considered in determining the allowable number of days include:\n\t\tl. whether sick leave is coordinated with sickness and accident insurance benefits; and\n\t\t2. whether unused sick leave may be carried over from year to year.\n\nCoverage\n\tSick leave benefit plans are more prevalent in professional, technical, and clerical fields. Protection against short-term disability for production workers is usually provided through accident and sickness insurance benefits.\n\n\tThe time periods may be coordinated with temporary or short-term disability leave plans that require a waiting period of up to two weeks before payments begin.\n\n\tA sick leave plan often is a self-funded, self-administered plan that does not involve insurance purchase. The employer allows employees a specified number of days off with pay as a result of sickness or accidents that occur outside of work (generally up to 10 working days).\n\nAccrual of days\n\tThe days of coverage may be accrued on a monthly basis (for example, one day of paid sick leave is earned when an employee completes one month of continuous, full-time employment), or allocated once a year (for example, all full\u00ad time, salaried employees are entitled to take up to 10 days per calendar year as sick leave on a paid basis when they or their dependents are ill or have sustained accidental injuries that are not job-related).\n\nCarryover of sick days\n\tIn some cases, employers allow employees to accumulate unused sick days and carry them forward to succeeding years. These days may then be taken at some future date when the employee needs paid time off due to illness or accident. Employers that offer this type of sick leave policy may institute a maximum number of days that may be accumulated and carried over.\n\nTax treatment\n\tSick leave administered via a sick leave plan is includible in the employee's gross income as regular compensation.(Reference 1 below) The employer may deduct the cost of accident and health benefits whether it pays insurance premiums, contributes to a health or welfare fund to provide the benefits, or directly pays the costs as ordinary and necessary business expenses. (Reference 2 below) Contributions paid by employers to a revocable trust to fund sick leave payments are deductible by the employer only when used as sick leave by the employees.(Reference 3 below)\n\nFor more information ...\n\tSick leave is discussed in greater detail, in the context of paid time off, at KB-1 Topic 3165.\n\nReferences\n1.

                    "text": "KB-1 - Claims Under a Health Care FSA\n\tA health care FSA can reimburse a participant only for properly substantiated claims for medical expenses.1 What constitutes a \"properly substantiated\" claim? As with insurance coverage generally, a written statement from an independent third party describing the medical expense and indicating the amount of the expense is necessary.\n\tIn determining whether, under all the facts and circumstances, employees are being reimbursed for inadequately substantiated claims, special scrutiny is given to other arrangements, such as employer-to-employee loans, that are related to the employee premium payments or actual or projected employee claims.\n\nClaims incurred\n\tMedical expenses reimbursed under a health care FSA must be incurred during the participant's period of coverage under the FSA2 Expenses are treated as having been incurred when the participant receives medical care that gives rise to the medical expenses, and not when the participant is formally billed or charged for, or pays for, the medical care.\n\tFor example, if an employee has an eye exam on December 29 but does not formally receive a bill until the following year, the eye exam expense is treated as incurred in the year the eye exam was done.\n\tAlso, expenses are not treated as incurred during a period of FSA coverage if\nthey are incurred before the later of the date:\n\t1. the health care FSA is first in existence; or\n\t2. the participant first becomes enrolled. Advance reimbursements are expressly disallowed.\n\nClaims submitted after year end\n\tTypically, plan administrators allow some time after the end of the plan year for participants to submit, for payment, claims incurred during the plan year.\n\tPointer: Participants should be given a deadline by which they must submit their claims.\n\tFor most FSAs, the extra amount of time after the plan year ends (i.e., a \"run\u00ad out period\") during which participants may submit claims is generally in the range of 90 to 120 days. The FSA's recordkeeping system will have to keep track of when the claims were incurred so that submitted claims can be correctly allocated between current and prior plan years.\n\tA run-out period is different from a grace period under IRS guidance allowing for claims to be incurred and submitted up to two and a half months after the end of the plan year (see ,\u00b6 2205). Expenses must be incurred during the plan year and the grace period (if any) but reimbursement for those expenses still may be submitted and paid during a run-out period. The IRS has not addressed how long a run-out period can be.\n\n1 Prop. Reg. \u00a7 1.125-5.\n2 Prop. Reg. \u00a7 1.125-5.\n"

If they are absent on the first day that the plan is in effect, they become covered the next day that they are actively at work.\n    Pointer: An insurer may agree to cover all employees on the plan's effective date even if they are on vacation, on leave, not scheduled to work that day, absent due to illness, or on temporary layoff.\n    Waiting period. New employees enrolling in an existing plan typically have to work a specified period of time or number of hours on a regular basis before becoming eligible for coverage. This waiting period varies in length from employer to employer but is often around three months. Group health plans and insurers cannot impose waiting periods that exceed 90 days (Reference 1 below).\n    Once an employee is eligible for the plan, the employee usually has a limited time period in which to enroll. An employee or eligible family member who does not enroll when first eligible, but later chooses to join the plan, may have to undergo a medical examination, and may not be covered for preexisting conditions.\n    Dependent coverage. Dependent coverage usually begins with the enrollment of the employee so that when the employee receives coverage, so do eligible dependents whom the employee has enrolled. An employee may be required to provide evidence of insurability in order to cover dependents who are not initially covered, unless the dependent is a newborn infant.\n    Adopted children. Group health plans that provide coverage for dependent children must treat children placed with participants or beneficiaries for adoption in the same manner as natural children. This rule applies from the time the child is placed for adoption, even if that placement ultimately fails to result in an adoption. In addition, at the time the child is placed for adoption and becomes covered under a participant's health plan, the plan may not restrict coverage solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the child  (Reference 2 below).\n    Domestic partners. Some health plans define the term \"family\" broadly enough to include domestic partners of employees. Not all domestic partners, however, meet state law requirements for spousal equivalents.\n    Some employers have extended health benefits to domestic partners as spouses regardless of state laws.\n\nFor more information...\n    Rules governing coverage for domestic partners are addressed at KB-1 Topic 312.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2708, as added by Act Sec. 1201(4) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), as amended by Affordable Care Act Sec. 10103(b).\n2 ERISA Sec. 609(c); PWBA Opinion Letter 95-18A, 7/27/95.\n"

In determining good faith, the IRS will take into account whether an employer or other coverage provider made reasonable efforts to prepare for reporting and providing the required information. Employers and providers that cannot file timely forms should still file the overdue forms as soon as possible, because the IRS will take the late forms into account in determining whether to abate the late-filing penalties.(Reference 2 below)\n \nRequired information.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1005 - Retiree Health Care - Role of Medicare\n\n\tThe Social Security system includes a system of hospital insurance and medical care for persons age 65 and over known as Medicare. A federal government agency known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the program. Medicare is designed to protect retirees age 65 and over from devastating medical costs that result from long-term hospitalization. Long-term care outside of a hospital is a cost not adequately covered by government or employer medical plans.\n\tThe Medicare program has a role in assisting employers to provide retiree health care.\n\nEligibility\n\tBroadly, Medicare entitles those individuals who are age 65 or over and eligible to receive Social Security benefits, survivor benefits, or disability benefits to hospital coverage and, at an additional cost, to insured physician payments. These are the two parts of Medicare, known as Part A and Part B.\n\nPart A coverage\n\tPart A of Medicare pays for inpatient hospital care and services and covers skilled nursing home services. Inpatient care includes medically necessary nursing, drugs, diagnostic or therapeutic care, supplies, equipment, and appliances. Home health care or hospice care may also qualify for reimbursement by Medicare.\n\tPart A is subject to deductibles on a per-episode basis ($1,408 for 2020) and to coinsurance for each day of care beyond the sixtieth. There are limits on the number of days allowed for skilled nursing care and psychiatric hospitalization.\n\tMost people do not pay a monthly Part A premium because they or a spouse has 40 or more quarters of Medicare-covered employment. In fact, only about one percent of people with Medicare pay a premium for Part A services. For people who have to buy Part A, the full Part A premium for 2020 is $458 per month.\n\n\nPart B coverage\n\tPart B applies to physician and professional services. This coverage is voluntary and costs the Medicare beneficiary a premium on a monthly basis. The standard Part B premium amount in 2020 will be $144.60, though an income-related adjustment will be applied to individuals and couples at higher incomes. However, most people who get Social Security benefits will pay less than this amount. The annual deductible for Part B for 2020 is $198 per year. Covered services include ambulance, X-ray and diagnostic tests, ambulatory surgical care, outpatient hospital care, physical and occupational therapy, durable medical equipment, and physician charges whether the patient is hospitalized or not.\n\tThe Medicare beneficiary may pay for Part B services by assigning payment or by seeking reimbursement for payments made to the health care provider. Reimbursement allowances are based on reasonable and customary charges, except for physician's services, which are based on a fee schedule. Physicians are allowed to collect coinsurance amounts from the beneficiary.\n\tPointer: Because of the deductibles and co-insurance amounts required under both Parts A and B, a large percentage of Medicare beneficiaries have some type of private supplemental health insurance (known as Medigap) to fill specific gaps in the Medicare coverage system.\n\nMedicare Part D\n\tThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) created a new Medicare Part D Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program. The program became effective January 1, 2006, and is the primary payor of prescription drugs for Medicare-eligible individuals who are no longer employed.\n\tA standard prescription drug plan beginning in 2020 requires a $435 deductible. The beneficiary pays 25 percent of the drug costs up to $4,020 (in 2020) after the deductible is met. Drug costs above $4,020 are paid out-of-pocket until the beneficiary has paid $6,350 in 2020. In 2020, after exiting the donut hole, co-pays are $3.60 for generics and preferred multiple source drugs and $8.95 for all other drugs. After the $5,100 figure is met, the beneficiary pays 5 percent of the drug cost, or a modest copayment. A subsidy is available for low-income beneficiaries. However, many prescription plans are available which offer better than the standard benefits, with deductibles of zero, and coverage in the \"gap.\"\n\tThe Act also provides for a nontaxable subsidy to employers that maintain retiree drug benefits that are \"actuarially equivalent\" to Medicare Part D. Employers will have to retain records that are sufficient to ensure the adequacy of the coverage and the accuracy of the payments made. The employers must also tell HHS and Part D-eligible individuals whether or not the plan meets the actuarial equivalence standard.\n\tElimination of deduction for Part D subsidy. Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the provision that allows an employer to disregard the value of any qualified retiree prescription drug plan subsidy in calculating the employer's business deduction for retiree prescription drug costs was repealed, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. Thus, the amount otherwise allowable as a business deduction for retiree prescription drug expenses will be reduced by the amount of the excludable subsidy payments received.(Reference 1 below)\n\nMedicare payment systems\n\tMedicare pays for most Part A services under a prospective payment system (PPS). Under this system, payment for care is based on the assignment of the case to a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). See below.\n\nMedicare as secondary payer\n\tOriginally, Medicare was the primary insurer for the working aged (those individuals who are age 65 and older but continue to work for an employer of 20 or more employees). As the expenses of Medicare rose, Congress began to look for ways to shift the cost burden to private insurance companies.\n\tIn 1980, Congress enacted the first set of Medicare Secondary Payer provisions that transferred the responsibility of paying primary health care benefits for the working aged to private employer health plans. The laws were refined subsequently to permit the government to recover overpayments from the person, the employer plan, the provider, any third party, or \"any entity that would be responsible for payment with respect to such item or service.\"\n\tWhen a payment by Medicare is on behalf of a plan for which the insurer acts solely as administrator, the government must look to the employer, rather than to the insurer, for reimbursement. Furthermore, an insurer must notify the government when. it learns of a possible primary payment by Medicare, regardless of whether the payment has actually been made.\n\tGenerally, Medicare has carved out certain segments of the age 65 and over population. For individuals who continue to work past age 65, Medicare is the secondary payer. For spouses 65 or older, even if the employee is under age 65, Medicare is the secondary payer.\n\n\tEmployers are required to offer employees age 65 or over the same group health plan coverage as is available to younger employees. The employee and spouse then have the option of choosing the employer plan or Medicare as their primary plan. If they choose Medicare as the primary plan, the employer may not offer complementary coverage, however, if the employer plan is primary, Medicare is the secondary plan.\n\tPointer: This does not require\u00b7 employers to offer coverage if they do not normally do so. However, it does mean that employers must extend the coverage to persons who work past age 65 if the employer offers a health plan.\n\nDiagnosis related groups\n\tIn order to try to cope with spiraling medical costs, Medicare adopted in 1983 a payment system to regulate the cost of care based on the type of illness. Diseases were categorized into Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Reimbursement from Medicare for inpatient hospital care depended on the DRG assigned, which was based on the diagnosis and procedure, age of the patient, and complications, if any. The type of hospital and its mix of cases also contributed to the weight assigned to each DRG.\n\tAt first, physicians and hospitals accepted Medicare's estimate based on reasonable and customary charges as payment in full. As their costs escalated and the freeze on physician cost increases continued, however, the doctors no longer accepted the Medicare amount as full payment, but began to shift costs to the patient. This cost-shifting affected both individuals and employers whose plans paid for what Medicare did not cover or reimburse fully.\n\tDRGs assign patients and the kinds of resources used to treat them into approximately 510 categories within 25 major diagnostic categories (MDCs).\nThe assignment to a DRG is made by compiling the diagnoses and any procedure codes for the treatment. When the initial and subsequent diagnoses are made, a code is assigned. If a surgical procedure is performed, a procedure code is noted. These codes, the patient's age and sex, and any complications are consid\u00ad ered together and a DRG is assigned to the case.\n\tUnder PPS, the DRG may be weighted for the type of facility, case mix, and location. The system then assigns a fixed price for the discharge. Hospitals may retain any difference between the DRG reimbursement and the actual cost, but are to absorb any shortfall.\n\nPhysician reimbursement system\n\tMedicare has extended the DRG concept of payment to physician fees by establishing a resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). The program is de\u00ad signed not only to control costs but also to encourage prevention and discourage technical medical intervention. Rather than reasonable and customary being the basis for accepting charges from a physician, RBRVS considers the resources required for each service, a monetary conversion factor, and the geographic location. Services of family practitioners are valued higher than those of surgeons and radiologists. In addition, balance billing by nonparticipating physicians is limited.\n\nCase review\n\tMedicare also attempts to ensure appropriate care by reviewing cases. Peer review organizations (PROs) evaluate the medical necessity of the treatment on a retrospective basis. If PROs find treatment was not needed, physicians must refund to the patient any fees collected for this care. The burden for efficient care now rests with the facilities that choose to accept Medicare patients. The patients are protected against extreme costs since their doctors have accepted the Medicare payment.\n\nEmployers and Medicare\n\tEmployers attempting to coordinate a retiree health care program with Medi\u00ad care are aiming at a moving target. Coverage and premium costs change, yet employers do not want to absorb the full burden of hospital costs so long as the government program is adequate. Medicare does not cover all retirees. People who retired before attaining age 65 are not covered until they reach age 65. Those who are 65 but are not eligible for Social Security benefits may not be eligible for Medicare.\n\tHowever, many employers have found that coordinating a retiree medical plan similar in design to preretirement medical plans with Medicare is the least expensive way for an employer to provide coverage to retirees age 65 and over.\n\n\tThe three most common methods of coordinating retiree medical benefits with Medicare are the following:\n\tl. carve-out method-this method enables a company to limit plan liability to the difference between the amount covered by Medicare and the amount the company's plan would normally pay;\n\t2. standard coordination method-this method requires the plan to pay the usual benefit, not exceeding the amount of an expense that has not been paid by Medicare-this provides the most generous net benefit of the three choices; \t\tand\n\t3. government exclusion or Medicare exclusion method\u00ad this method allows a plan to reduce the amount of an expense not covered by Medicare by applying the plan deductible and coinsurance amounts to determine the actual benefit \t\tpayable.\n\nMedicare coverage\n\tAs currently structured, Medicare has several significant exclusions, namely, long-term custodial care, non-hospital mental health care, and elective care.\n\nSupplementary insurance\n\tBecause of the deductibles and coinsurance amounts required under both Parts A and B, most Medicare beneficiaries have some type of private supplemental health insurance coverage. The law provides rules governing Medigap insurance (i.e., supplemental insurance policies that are designed to fill specific gaps in the Medicare benefit structure).\n\nFor more information ...\n\tMedicare risk HMOs are addressed in more detail at KB-1 Topic 1007.\n\tMedicare is covered in greater depth at KB-1 Topic 53,140 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 Code Sec. 139A, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act) (P.L. 111-148); Act Sec. 9012(b) of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by Act Sec. 1407 of the Health Care and Education Reconcilia\u00ad tion Act of 2010 (P.L. ill-152).\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 21 - Social Insurance Programs - Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefits - Enrollment\n             Each individual entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Part B qualifies for Part D coverage. Individuals enrolled in traditional Medicare will receive their benefits through a stand-alone PDP. Individuals enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan will have coverage through an MA-PD plan. (See Appendix 21.2 for a list of communications materials used to educate beneficiaries about Part D.)\n\n             Most eligible Part D beneficiaries were able to choose a Part D plan starting on November 15, 2005. Two special groups were identified for consideration:\n\u25a0 Dual eligibles (individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid). These individuals were automatically enrolled in a Part D plan. A dual eligible is a Medicare beneficiary who is currently receiving state Medicaid benefits. Medicaid drug coverage for Medicare eligibles was terminated on December 31, 2005. In order to continue drug coverage, dual eligibles were automatically assigned to qualifying plans starting in October 2005. These individuals can switch out of their automatically assigned plans every 30 days.\n\u25a0 Limited-income beneficiaries. These individuals were eligible for a low-income cost-sharing subsidy (LICS).\n\n            The Medicare Part D subsidy starts on the date when the dual-eligible senior becomes eligible. If a delay occurs in starting the senior on the pro\u00ad gram, the senior is eligible for retroactive coverage for prescription medications back to the eligibility date. Effective in 2011, the annual coordinated election period (also known as the annual open enrollment period (AEP)) will be from October 15 to December 7 for the 2012 plan year. (Note that the first-year open enrollment period was November 15, 2005, through May 15, 2006.) Beneficiaries have an option of at least two Part D plans per region.\n\n            Retirees must follow their employers' plan coverage rules to remain eligible for their retiree coverage. However, if retirees decide to leave their employer coverage midyear, they may enroll in a Medicare Part D plan only during the Medicare open enrollment period. For example, if a retiree left the employer's Part D plan in July, he or she would have to wait until the November open enrollment period for coverage for the following year. Exceptions are allowed for the following special circumstances:\n\u25a0 Beneficiaries who permanently move out of the plan service area\n\u25a0 Individuals entering, residing in, or leaving a long-term care facility\n\u25a0 Involuntary loss, reduction, or nonnotification of creditable coverage\n\u25a0 Other exceptional circumstances\n            Some Medicare patients may be subject to a late enrollment penalty if they do not sign up for Part D when they are first eligible. This late penalty fee is a carryover from Medicare Part B. Two categories of patients are at risk. The first group includes patients who were eligible for Medicare before January 2006 and had to sign up by May 15, 2006, to avoid a higher premium. The second group includes patients who became eligible for Medicare after January 2006 and had to sign up for Part D within 63 days after the end of their initial enrollment period to avoid a higher premium.\n\n             The higher premium will be based on an increase of at least 1 percent of the base beneficiary premium (i.e., $31.94 for 2010) per month for every month that they waited to enroll. This premium may change each year. For example, if John Doe is without creditable coverage for 18 months, his penalty is 18 percent (1 percent x 18 months) multiplied by $31.94 (base beneficiary premium) = $5.75. This amount would then be added to the monthly premium, for example $20.00. In this example, John Doe would pay a higher premium of $20.00 + $5.75 = $25.75.\n\n             The fees will be reflected in higher monthly premiums for the beneficiary's lifetime. However, if a Medicare beneficiary has a creditable coverage equivalent to or better than Part D (e.g., employer or retirement plan), this penalty does not apply.

After eligibility has been determined, the applicant is notified of the determination.\n\n             These individuals had a two-step enrollment process. First, they were prescreened for income and assets through an application process administered by the SSA. After approval from the SSA, the beneficiary had to choose a Part D plan after November 15, 2005. If the low-income-subsidy (LICS) beneficiary did not choose a Part D plan by May 15, 2006, he or she was automatically enrolled into a qualifying Part D plan. (Note that dual eligibles did not have to fill out SSA applications.)\n\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Group Insurance Pricing - Manual Rating\n\n\tIn the manual-rating process, insurance companies establish premium rates only for broad classes of group insurance business, and they do not consider the past claims experience of a particular group when determining that group's rates. However, claims experience is not entirely ignored, because insurers use the aggregate claims experience for a class of business to determine the premium rates for that class.\n\tInsurers use manual rating with small groups for which no credible individual loss experience is available. This lack of credibility exists because the group's size makes it impossible to determine whether other-than-average loss experience is due to random chance or is truly reflective of the group. Manual rating is also frequently used to determine the initial premiums for groups that are subject to experience rating, particularly when a group's past experience is unobtainable or when a group is being written for the first time. In addition, experience rating typically uses a weighting of manual rates and the actual experience of a group to determine the premium. (Rates for very large groups may be based solely on a group's own experience.)\n\nRating Basis\n\tPrior to the actual calculation of manual premium rates, insurers develop a basis on which the rates are determined. This rating basis involves a decision regarding (1) what benefit unit to use, (2) the extent to which rates are refined by factors affecting claims, and (3) the frequency with which premiums are paid.\n\nBenefit Unit\n\tSubject to certain adjustments, insurers calculate the premium for a group by multiplying the premium rate by the number of benefit units provided. Although variations do occasionally exist, the benefit units predominantly used for the most common types of group insurance are shown in the following table.\n\nTable 15-1 Benefit Units\nType of Group Insurance\tBenefit Unit\nTerm life (including accidental death and dismemberment)\nShort-term disability income Long-term disability income\nMedical expense (including dental)\tEach $1,000 of death benefit\nEach $10 of weekly income Each $100 of monthly income\nEach employee and each category of dependents\n\nFactors Affecting Claims\n\tRates reflect those factors that result in different claims experience for different groups. Although there are variations among insurance companies, the following discussion indicates the factors used by most insurance companies to determine rates for life, disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance.\n\tGender. Gender of insured persons is taken into account for determining rates for all the types of insurance mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\tAge. Age is also used as a rating factor for life insurance, disability income, and medical expense insurance. Dental insurance rates usually do not take age into consideration.\n\tGeographic Location. At one time, geographic location was a rating factor for medical expense insurance and dental insurance only. However, an increasing number of insurance companies use geographic variations for determining life insurance and disability income insurance rates. For these latter types of insurance, rates may not be determined separately for a wide variety of locations. Instead, the insurance company may have only two or three rate schedules, with each schedule applying to several different geographic locations on the basis of past experience.\n\tOccupation. Occupation is virtually always reflected in both life insurance rates and accidental death and dismemberment rates. It may also be reflected in disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance rates. Some companies ignore it as a rating factor but may not write coverage when certain occupations are involved.\n\tIncome. At one time, the income level of group members was commonly used as a factor in establishing disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance rates. Currently, income level is still a factor in determining dental insurance premiums, but it is more likely to be an underwriting consideration only in disability income and medical expense insurance.\n\tSize. The size of a group also affects rates because the proportion of the premium needed for expenses decreases as the size of a group increases. All manual premium rates are based on an assumption that the size of a group falls within a certain range. If the size of a group varies from this range, insurers make an appropriate rate adjustment to reflect this differential. In addition, many insurers reserve the right to rerate a group during the period of the contract or cancel the contract at renewal if the group changes in size by a certain percentage. This is particularly important in an era of downsizing and mergers.\n\tTime. A final factor considered in the calculation of rates is the length of time for which the rates will be in effect. This is a concern primarily for coverages that involve medical and dental claims, which over time are expected to increase in severity because of inflation. In inflationary times, monthly rates that are guaranteed for three months can be lower than those guaranteed for one year.\n\nFrequency of Premium Payment Period\n\tBecause employers usually pay group insurance premiums monthly, insurers generally determine rates for this period. When premiums can be paid less frequently (such as annually), they are usually slightly lower than the sum of the monthly premiums for the same period of coverage. This results from the extra investment earnings the insurer can get by collecting premiums earlier. In addition, the annual expense of processing premiums is lower if employers pay them less frequently.\n\nCalculation of Manual Premium Rates\nmanual premium rate\nfinal premium rate\n\tManual rating involves the calculation of the manual premium rate (also called tabular rate), which is quoted in an insurance company's rate book. The manual rate is applied to a specific group insurance case in order to determine a final premium rate (sometimes called an average premium rate) that is then multiplied by the number of benefit units to obtain a premium for the group.\n\tThere are three manual-rating methods. However, if identical assumptions are used, each method should result in approximately the same premium for any given group. The first method determines separate manual rates for groups with certain characteristics that an insurance company feels affect claims experience. A second approach establishes a single \"standard manual rate\" that is adjusted in the premium-calculation process to compensate for any characteristics that deviate from those of the standard group. A third method merely combines the first two approaches and considers some factors in determining the manual rate and other factors in determining the final premium rate.\n\nnet premium rate\n\tThe first step in the calculation of manual premium rates is the determination of the net premium rate, which is the amount necessary to support the cost of expected claims. For any given classification, the net premium rate is calculated by multiplying the probability (frequency) of a claim occurring by the expected amount (severity) of the claim. For example, if the probability that an employee aged 50 will die in the next month is .0005, then the net monthly premium for each $1,000 of coverage is .0005 x $1,000, or $.50. Because insurers collect premiums before claims are paid, they adjust this figure downward for anticipated interest earnings on these funds.\n\tIn general, insurance companies that write a large volume of any given type of group insurance rely on their own experience in determining the frequency and severity of future claims. Insurance companies that do not have enough past data for reliable future projections can turn to many sources for useful statistics. Probably the major source is the Society of Actuaries (Web site: soa.org), which regularly collects and publishes aggregate data on the group insurance business that is written by a number of large group insurance companies. Other sources of information are industry trade organizations and various agencies of the federal government.\n\nrisk charge\n\tThe second and final step in the calculation of manual premium rates is the adjustment of the net premium rates for expenses, a risk charge, and a contribution to surplus. Expenses include commissions, premium taxes, claims settlement costs, and other costs associated with the acquisition and servicing of group insurance business. The risk charge represents a contribution to the insurance company's contingency reserve as a cushion against unanticipated and catastrophic amounts of claims. The contribution to surplus or net worth represents the profit margin of the insurance company. Although mutual companies are legally nonprofit, they, like stock insurance companies, require a contribution to net worth that is a source of financing for future growth.\n\tFrom the standpoint of equity, the adjustment of the net premium rate is complex. Some factors, such as premium taxes and commissions, vary with the premium charge. However, the size of a group does not affect the premium tax rate, whereas the commission rate generally decreases as the size of a group increases. To a large degree, the expenses of settling claims vary with the number, and not the size, of claims. It costs just as much administratively to pay a $10,000 claim under a group life insurance plan as it does to pay a $100,000 claim. Certain other costs also tend to be fixed regardless of the size of a group. For simplicity, some insurance companies adjust or load their net premium rates by a constant percentage. However, other insurance companies consider the different patterns of expenses by using a percentage plus a constant charge. For example, if the net premium rate is $.60, this might be increased by 20 percent plus $.10 to arrive at a manual premium rate of $.82 (that is, $.60 x 1.2 + $.10). Because neither approach adequately accounts for the difference in expenses as a result of a group's size, another adjustment based on the size of the group is made in the calculation of the final premium rate.\n\nCalculation of Premiums\n\tProbably the best way to explain the actual calculation of group insurance premiums is through examples. The following analysis begins with group term life insurance, then discusses how the structure of manual premium rates and the premium calculation process differ for certain other types of group insurance.\n\nGroup Term Life Insurance\n\tThe mechanics of calculating a final premium rate and the premium for a particular group vary among insurance companies because of the differences in methods of preparing manual premium rates and the process by which insurers make adjustments to these rates.\n\tThe following example begins with the table below, which is an abbreviated version of a set of rates on a monthly basis per $1,000 of coverage at selected ages. As with most rate tables, the ages are those at a person's attained age (nearest birthday).\n\tThese rates are loaded for expenses, and they assume that the coverage contains a waiver-of-premium provision on disabled lives, accidental death and dismemberment coverage, and a conversion privilege. Consequently, rates are higher than if none of these additional benefits were included. When an employee converts coverage to an individual policy, a charge is assessed against the group insurance business of an insurance company to reflect the increased death claims that result from adverse selection on conversions. The amount of this assessment (commonly $50 to $75 per $1,000 of converted insurance) is transferred to the individual insurance department of the company to compensate it for having to write the converted business at too low a rate.\n\nTable 15-2 Term Insurance Rates\nAge at Nearest Birthday\t\nMale Rate\t\nFemale Rate\n20\t$0.16\t$0.10\n25\t0.18\t0.11\n30\t0.21\t0.12\n35\t0.24\t0.15\n40\t0.37\t0.21\n45\t0.48\t0.30\n50\t0.81\t0.48\n55\t1.24\t0.75\n60\t1.87\t1.12\n65\t2.83\t1.70\n70\t4.35\t2.52\n\n\tThe premium-calculation process starts with the determination of an \"unadjusted cost,\" based on a census of the covered employees and the manual rates. For example, assume a firm has 230 employees. For the sake of simplicity, also assume that each of these employees has $25,000 of life insurance and that the group has the age distribution shown in the next table.\n\nTable 15-3 Age Distribution\nAge\tMales\tFemales\n25\t20\t30\n30\t0\t30\n35\t10\t30\n40\t30\t10\n45\t30\t10\n50\t20\t10\n\n\tThe unadjusted cost is then calculated as shown in the following table.\n\nTable 15-4 Calculation of Unadjusted Cost\nAmount of\nNumber\tCoverage\tUnadjusted\nof\t(in\tRate (per\tUnadjusted\nAge  Gender  Employees\tThousands)\tThousand)\tCost\n25\tM\t20\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t$0.18\t$ 90.00\n35\tM\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.24\t60.00\n40\tM\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.37\t277.50\n45\tM\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.48\t360.00\n50\tM\t20\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.81\t405.00\n25\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.11\t82.50\n30\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.12\t90.00\n35\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.15\t112.50\n40\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.21\t52.50\n45\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.30\t75.00\n50\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.48\t120.00\n\t\t\t\tTotal\tunadjusted\tcost\t\t$1,725.00\n\n\tThe second step is to reduce the sum of the unadjusted cost by a percentage based on the volume of a group insurance plan as determined by its monthly premium. This reduction results from the fact that the expenses associated with a group insurance plan decrease on a percentage basis as the size (premium volume) of the plan increases. The next table shows the reductions used in this example (for selected monthly premiums).\n\nTable 15-5 Premium Reductions\nPremium before Reduction\tPercentage Expense Reduction\nUnder $200\t0%\n200-249\t\n\n1,000-1,499\t\n6\n1,500-1,999\t7\n\n60,000-79,999\t\n19\n80,000 and over\t20\n\n\tThus, the initial monthly premium for the group in this example is calculated as follows:\n\nUnadjusted cost\t$1,725.00\nMinus expense reduction (7 percent)\t-120.75\nAdjusted monthly premium\t$1,604.25\n\n\tThe initial monthly premium is also used to calculate the final monthly premium rate per $1,000 of protection for the group:\n\n.\t\tAdjusted monthly premium premium\t-=--------...C.\t:.--\u00ad\nTotal volume(in thousands)\n$1,604.25\n(230 X $25.000)/$1,000\n= $1,604.25\n5750\n= $0.28\n\n\tThis final monthly premium rate (usually rounded to either the nearest cent or one-tenth of a cent) is used throughout the first policy year and is multiplied each month by the amount of insurance in force to calculate the monthly premium due. Adjustments to the final monthly premium rate because of changes in the makeup of employees by age or gender are not made until the beginning of the next policy year as part of the renewal process. Insurance companies generally guarantee the initial rate for at least one year, assuming that there is no change in the benefit structure of the plan. However, 2- and 3-year rate guarantees are not unusual.\n\tManual rates are designed so that insurance companies can write policies for businesses in most industries at those rates. However, they may charge higher rates for employers in industries that they considered hazardous.\nThese increased rates are usually in the form of a surcharge per $1,000 of coverage that is added to the unadjusted cost before the expense reduction percentage is applied. For example, an industry that is expected to have about one death claim per year per 1,000 employees in excess of those assumed in the manual rates might be charged for this excess mortality with a surcharge of $.06 per $1,000 of coverage per month.\n\tTherefore, the adjusted monthly premium is calculated as shown below:\n\nUnadjusted cost\t$1,725.00\nPlus industry surcharge\t+ 345.00\nTotal cost before expense reduction\t$2,070.00\nMinus expense reduction (8 percent)\t- 165.60\nAdjusted monthly premium\t$1,904.40\n\n\tSimilarly, the expectation of two extra death claims per year would result in an added premium of $.12 per $1,000 per month, or $690.\n\tVariations for Large Groups. Insurance companies use the premium\u00ad calculation process discussed above for most groups over a certain size, usually from 10 or more to 50 or more lives, but variations do exist. For example, some insurance companies do not incorporate a charge for a waiver of premium or accidental death and dismemberment coverage into their manual rates. Rather, an extra charge, which usually differs by industry, is added for this coverage. Also, some companies use (and are required to use in a few states) manual rates that vary by age but not gender. These unisex rate tables are based on assumptions about the ratio of males to females in the group. However, insurers usually make an adjustment the premium-calculation process if the actual group ratio differs from this assumption.\n\tSome companies incorporate a level of expenses into their manual rate so that there is no expense reduction for a certain-size group. In the final premium-calculation process, an adjustment is made; larger groups receive an expense reduction and smaller groups receive an expense surcharge. The following is one such table of adjustments.\n\nTable 15-6 Premium Adjustments\nMonthly Premium before Adjustment\tPercentage Adjustment\nUnder $200\t+25%\n200-249\t+22\n\n700-799\t\n+1\n800-999\t0\n\n50,000-74,999\t\n-14\n75,000 and over\t-15\n\n\tVariations for Small Groups. The manual-rating process for small groups, including those written by multiple-employer trusts, differs from that of large groups in several ways. In general, insurers band the manual rates by age, typically in 5-year intervals. The following table is an example of one such monthly rate table for each $1,000 of coverage.\n\nTable 15-7 Banded Rates\nAge at Nearest Birthday\tMale Rate\tFemale Rate\nUnder 30\t$0.24\t$0.10\n30-34\t0.24\t0.13\n35-39\t0.25\t0.15\n40-44\t0.36\t0.20\n4 9\t0.58\t0.36\n50-54\t0.91\t0.54\n55-59\t1.55\t0.79\n60-64\t1.93\t1.02\n65--69\t3.30\t1.81\n70 and over\t6.80\t3.23\n\n\tAn unadjusted cost is developed based on a census of the employees by age and by gender unless unisex rates are used. Because the manual rates are loaded for most expenses, and because the groups written tend to be reasonably close in size, typically no adjustment for size is made. However, to compensate for the expenses of periodic billings, most insurance companies apply a flat fee to all groups, commonly between $10 and $20 per billing. Some companies do not levy this charge if the premium is paid annually. To reflect the administrative costs associated with record keeping, some insurance companies also levy a modest one-time expense charge when a plan adds coverage for a new employee.\n\tFor large groups, the initial monthly premium is used to determine a monthly premium rate that applies for a specified period. In contrast, the monthly premium rate for small groups may be recalculated each month based not only on the volume of insurance but also on changes in the makeup of employees by age and gender (unless unisex rates are used), just as if the group were being newly written. However, most insurance companies do guarantee that the manual rates used when the group was initially written (and any future manual rates applicable to the group) remain applicable for some period, with 12 months being common.\n\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance\n\tAccidental death and dismemberment insurance is usually not written as a separate coverage unless coverage is voluntary. Rather, it is added by an endorsement to a group term insurance contract. A single manual rate typically applies to all employees regardless of age or gender, but it varies depending on whether coverage is written (1) for nonoccupational accidents only or (2) on a 24-hour basis for both nonoccupational and occupational accidents. The rate for nonoccupational coverage generally does not vary by industry and ranges from $.02 to $.05 per $1,000 of principal sum per month. However, the rate for coverage on a 24-hour basis does vary by industry, and although it falls within this same range for low-risk industries, it may be several times higher for hazardous ones. Some companies calculate a separate cost for the accidental death and dismemberment coverage and add it to the charge for the group term life insurance. However, most employers purchase accidental death and dismemberment coverage. As a result, other insurance companies incorporate the cost into the manual rates for group term life insurance, making the principal sum equal to the amount of life insurance protection purchased, and an additional charge is levied only if the employer desires a higher level of accidental death and dismemberment coverage.\n\nDependent Life Insurance\n\tDependent life insurance may be added as additional coverage to a group life insurance contract that provides protection for employees. Because dependent life insurance coverage is usually a modest fixed amount (such as $2,000 on the spouse and $1,000 on each child) that generates a relatively small additional premium, insurers tend to use a very simplified rate structure. However, several variations do exist. Some insurance companies have\na single flat rate, independent of the type or number of dependents, for each employee who has dependent coverage. Other companies have two separate flat rates: one for the spouse's coverage and the other for children's coverage. The rate for the children's coverage is a family rate regardless of the number of children, and it is based upon an average-sized family.\n\tFlat rates are based on the assumption that the group has an average age mix of employees. If the group of employees is older than average, the flat rate for dependent coverage may be adjusted (particularly when it applies to spouses) to reflect the likelihood that the dependents are also above average in age when compared to the dependents of most other groups. A flat rate is commonly used when employees pay the entire cost of dependent coverage. The uniform charge is easy to communicate to employees, and it simplifies the payroll-deduction process for the employer.\n\tSome insurance companies also use a rate for dependent coverage that varies with the employee's age, thereby assuming that older employees have older dependents. Basing the rate on the employee's age may seem illogical, but it is administratively simpler and less expensive than having to determine the ages of dependents. A single variable rate may apply to the total family coverage for the spouse and all children, or it may apply only to the spouse. In this latter case, a flat rate is generally used if coverage for children is also provided.\n\tIt is becoming less common to see dependent life insurance added to the basic group life coverage for an employee. Instead, this coverage is more frequently being written as an employee-pay-all voluntary benefit, with higher amounts of coverage available.\n\nShort-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\tIn addition to varying by age, by gender, and possibly by geographic location, manual rates for short-term disability income insurance also differ according to (1) the maximum benefit period, (2) the length of the waiting period, and (3) the writing of coverage either on a 24-hour basis or only for nonoccupational disabilities.\nSome insurance companies (particularly those for small groups) have only a single standard short-term disability income plan that they sell, and therefore they only need a single manual rate table. On the other hand, some companies allow the employer to exercise a degree of flexibility in designing the plan. Rather than make adjustments to a single rate table, these companies usually have several rate tables. These tables vary by such factors as maximum benefit period (such as 13 or 26 weeks) and waiting period (such as 7 days for all disabilities or 7 days for illnesses and no waiting period for injuries). If they allow any other variations, they make appropriate rate adjustments.\n\tInsurers adjust for the nature of the industry the group represents. Ignoring the occupational injuries and diseases that are covered under workers' compensation, a few occupations are still characterized by higher-than-average disability income claims. As an alternative to a rate adjustment, some insurance companies have underwriting standards that prohibit the writing of coverage for these groups.\n\tUntil the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and various state laws, it was common for insurance companies to have one manual rate for plans that did not provide benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities and another for plans that did provide such benefits. Because most employers can no longer exclude pregnancy as a cause of disability, insurers usually do not publish rates for coverage without this benefit, except for the employers of small groups that still have an option regarding this benefit in many states.\n\tIn contrast to group life insurance rates, which are lower for females than for males, disability income rates are higher for females. Ignoring pregnancy-related disabilities, the claims of females at younger ages still somewhat exceed those of males. However, because male and female claims are comparable at older ages, the rates for later years seldom vary. The following table, which illustrates one insurance company's monthly manual rates per $10 of weekly benefit for 26 weeks following a 7-day waiting period, shows how this rate differential is even more pronounced at younger ages if maternity coverage is included.\n\nTable 15-8 Disability Income Rates\nAge\tMale\tFemale\nUnder 30\t$0.48\t$1.25\n30-34\t0.52\t1.25\n35-39\t0.56\t1.25\n40-44\t0.72\t1.21\n45-49\t0.81\t1.21\n50--54\t1.01\t1.31\n55-59\t1.21\t1.53\n60--64\t1.61\tl.61\n65-69\t2.01\t2.01\n70 and over\t2.16\t2.16\n\n\tIn the past, it was common for short-term disability income rates to be expressed on the basis of each $10 of weekly benefit. This is probably still the norm, but some insurance companies are now expressing their rates in terms of a higher weekly benefit, such as $50 or $100.\n\nLong-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\tLike short-term disability income rates, the manual rates for long-term coverage vary by age, gender, the length of the benefit period, the length of the waiting period, and possibly geographic location. In addition, the\nmanual rates reflect the fact that benefits are coordinated with Social Security and certain other disability income benefits for which an employee might be eligible. To the extent that insurers allow variations in the coordination provision that was assumed in developing the manual rates, they adjust the premium-calculation process. As is also the case with short-term rates, insurers might adjust for certain occupations.\n\tUnlike short-term disability income rates, which are commonly expressed on the basis of a weekly benefit, long-term rates are typically expressed on the basis of a monthly benefit, usually per $100. Unlike the coverages previously discussed, long-term disability claims fluctuate with general economic conditions. Consequently, insurance companies review and possibly revise their manual rates (and/or their underwriting standards) as economic conditions change.\n\tThe period for which insurers guarantee rates may vary from one to 3 years, depending on the industry in which the employees work.\n\nMedical Expense Insurance\n\tIn many ways, the manual rates for medical expense insurance (and also for dental insurance) are similar to those for disability income insurance because variations exist by age, gender, and the provisions of the plan, including the size of the deductible, the coinsurance percentage, and the level of benefits. Most providers of medical expense coverage have manual rates for the few standard plans that they sell, and only large employers have the flexibility to deviate from these plans. Adjustments to the manual rates reflect any such deviation. Insurers may also adjust manual rates if the employer is in an industry that has higher-than-average claims.\n\tOne other factor, geographic location, is always a variable in the manual rates because of the significant differences in medical costs across the country. Depending on group size, insurers may adjust for location in one of two ways. For large groups, the rating process usually starts with a manual rate that does not consider the location of employees. Each county (or other geographic subdivision) where coverage is written is then assigned a factor that is based on the cost of health care in that location compared with the \"average\" cost that is assumed in the manual rates. For example, if Seattle were 20 percent higher than average, it would have a factor of 1.2. If all of a firm's employees are there, the manual rates for that group is multiplied by a location factor of 1.2 in the process of determining the group's premium. If employees are in several locations, a composite factor is calculated as shown in the following table. Consequently, the manual rate for this group is increased by 5.5 percent because of the employees' locations.\n\nTable 15-9 Calculation of Location Factor\n\tNumber of\tLocation\nLocation\tEmployees\tFactor\tProduct\nSeattle\t100\tX\t1.2\t120\nKansas City\t70\tX\t1.0\t70\nBirmingham\t30\tX\t0.7\t21\n200\t211\n\nLocation Factor Total product ---= 211 =1055\n=----'----\t-\nTotal number of employees\t200\n\n\tInsurers use a slightly different approach for small groups. Because employees are usually in one location, many insurers have manual rate tables for between 10 and 20 rating territories, and they assign a specific territorial rating to each geographic area in which employees are located. The following territorial classifications are from the rating manual of one insurance company for some areas in four of the states where it writes business. The first three digits of the zip code identify these areas.\n\nGeorgia\n301-302, 311\t8\n303-304, 308-310, 312-319\t7\nall others\t6\nMichigan\n482\t10\n480,483\t8\n481\t6\n484-485,488-489\t3\nall others\t2\nTennessee\n370-372\t4\nall others\t3\nUtah\nentire state\t1\n\n\tThe next table, an excerpt from the manual rate tables of another company, shows how the monthly cost for coverage under one of its PPO plans varies by geographic area within a single state.\n\nTable 15-10 Medical Expense Rates\nEmployee's\nAge\t\nClass of Coverage\t\nArea 1\t\nArea 2\t\nArea 3\t\nArea 4\n30-39\tEmployee\t$248\t$305\t$335\t$ 459\n30-39\tEmployee and spouse\t404\t495\t551\t793\n30-39\tEmployee and children\t436\t535\t576\t791\n30-39\tFamily\t708\t856\t940\t1,331\n50-59\tEmployee\t448\t525\t523\t690\n50-59\tEmployee and spouse\t779\t915\t934\t1,228\n50-59\tEmployee and children\t606\t718\t743\t990\n50-59\tFamily\t968\t1,139\t1,205\t1,652\n\n\tThis excerpt lists manual rates for dependent coverage that the insurer applies regardless of the number of children or the ages of the dependents. For any size group, this is one of several possible methods for pricing dependent coverage. Another method uses rates that vary by the number of children. Some rating structures also take the ages of dependents into consideration.\n\tBecause medical expense claims are continually increasing as a result of inflation, a trend factor must be applied to past claims experience when manual rates are developed. This is often difficult for employers to\nunderstand. It is also a complex and often perplexing task for most providers of medical expense coverage. Not only has the overall cost of medical care increased faster than the general cost of living (as measured by the consumer price index), but the increases have been erratic from year to year and are virtually impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy. To complicate matters further, these increases vary significantly for each category of medical expenses; therefore, insurers must apply different trend factors to different categories of claims.\n\tAt one time, insurers guaranteed group insurance premium rates for at least 12 months and possibly for as long as 2 or 3 years. However, to protect themselves against unexpected increases in claims because of increases in the cost of medical care, some insurance companies now guarantee medical expense rates for no more than 6 months. In fact, a number of multiple-employer trusts have only 3-month guarantees, or they contain provisions whereby rates can be increased at any time, provided the insurer gives notice of the rate increase 30 or 60 days in advance. Some companies allow an employer to select the length of the rate guarantee, such as 6 months or one year. However, the longer the rate guarantee, the higher the rate.\n\nDental Insurance\n\tAlthough the rating of dental insurance is similar in many ways to the rating of medical expense insurance, there are some significant differences. Most insurance companies do not vary their manual rates by the ages of group members. Instead, an adjustment is often made for the income levels of employees, because higher-paid persons are much more likely to obtain dental care. This adjustment is usually in the form of a percentage based on the extent to which the portion of employees with incomes higher than some figure (such as $30,000) exceeds the proportion of such employees that is assumed in the manual rates. There is also an adjustment for certain occupations (such as salespeople or teachers) that use dental services more frequently than average. Finally, insurers usually increase the manual rates when a plan is new (or expands benefits) if the employees have been informed of the change beforehand. Under these circumstances, there is a tendency to postpone needed dental care until the new plan is in effect.\n\n"

In some cases, however, employers may contribute a portion of the premium.\n\tAlthough employees' policies are underwritten individually, premium savings of 10 percent to 15 percent are possible versus comparable private insurance. Of course, the actual discount per employee varies, depending on the insurer and on each employee's own risk factors.\n\tClaims administration under group auto insurance generally is handled by the insurer.\n\tCaution: To protect themselves from potential liability, employers should include a provision in the plan holding themselves harmless in case a dispute arises between the employee and the insurer.\n\nAdvantages\n\tBoth employees and employers can benefit from group auto insurance. Employees benefit through discounted auto insurance rates. They also benefit from the convenience of making their auto insurance premium payments through payroll deductions.\n\tFor employers, group auto insurance can be a low-cost part of the benefit package offered to employees. However, it may not be suitable for all employers, such as those with high turnover rates.\n\tPointer: A person who participates in group auto insurance is not barred from maintaining a medical savings account (see KB-1 Topic 450).\n\nTax treatment\n\tBecause group auto insurance does not have tax-favored status, unlike premiums paid for employees' medical and health insurance, any premiums paid by companies for their employees' auto insurance are taxable to those employees as income.\n\tFrom the company's standpoint, any auto insurance premiums paid by companies for their employees are tax deductible by the employer.\n\tPointer: Companies that are interested in providing a particular type of auto insurance program for their employees should check to see what plans have been approved under their state insurance laws arid regulations.\n\nFor more information ...\n\tFor a detailed discussion of other types of voluntary benefits, see KB-1 Topic 1907.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

With a true group plan, the employer is the policy\u00adholder and employees are issued certificates of insurance. The employer can choose to include retirees, spouses, adult children, parents/in-laws, and siblings as part of the eligible group. With a multilife approach, individual insureds are the policyholders and are issued individual policies. In most cases, true group is a better match for larger employers, particularly those with widely dispersed populations. True group plans offer the following advantages:\n\u25a0 Availability of guaranteed issue for eligible, actively-at work employees\n\u25a0 No minimum participation requirements\n\u25a0 Fully portable coverage\n\u25a0 Low group rates, in many cases, with a rate guarantee period\n\u25a0 Transfer of reserve capabilities\n\u25a0 Turnkey approach to enrollment and administration\n\u25a0 Employer-dedicated website to support enrollment\n\tA multilife approach may be attractive to smaller employers or those wishing to give their employees greater flexibility in customizing their coverage. Some other advantages of a multilife approach are\n\u25a0 Simplified underwriting for eligible, actively at work employees\n\u25a0 Availability of preferred health and spousal/family member discounts\n\u25a0 Broker-assisted enrollments, with one-on-one consultations\n\u25a0 Availability of list and split billing\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Provider Networks\n\nprovider network\t\n         Networks of providers of health care services and the contracts that establish them are essential to managed care plans. These plans manage care primarily through the provider network that members in the plan are encouraged to use. Members may be required to receive covered medical care services from network providers only, or they must use these providers in order to obtain full plan benefits. To be successful, a managed care plan must create and maintain provider networks that do the following:\n\u2022 contain qualified providers of health care services\n\u2022 meet member needs for medical care services\n\u2022 compensate network providers in a manner that encourages efficient use of resources\n\n\nQualified Providers of Health Care Services\ncredentials\t\n          Managed care plans specify the qualifications, known as credentials, that providers must have and maintain to be a network participant. Physicians, for example, must document their training, licensure, certification in a specialty, and malpractice insurance coverage. In addition, they must be free of limitations, suspensions, or impairments that would affect their practice of medicine and hospital admitting privileges. Hospitals and other institutions must be licensed, accredited, and approved for participation in the Medicare program. Generally, a credentialing verification organization hired by the managed care plan obtains the information to determine if a provider has the qualifications that the plan requires. The plan repeats the credentialing process periodically to make sure that network providers continue to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMember Needs for Medical Care Services\n           A managed care plan's provider network must encompass the broad scope of health services that members may need and be conveniently accessible to those members.\n\n           Network providers include physicians, hospitals and other institutions, diagnostic radiology and laboratory services, and therapy services. Among the other institutions in a network are facilities that provide outpatient care, including surgery, rehabilitation, and skilled-nursing care. Although a few managed care plans may hire their health care professionals and own their facilities, most managed care plans establish their networks through contracts with providers. These providers may be solo practitioners or participate in various types of groups under a variety of organizational structures. A provider often participates in several networks and also treats patients who are not members of managed care plans. Plans may also contract with specialty care organizations for specific services. These services may include psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, radiology, laboratory and pathology services, transplant surgeries, and prescription drug services.\n\n             Networks need to allow members to have reasonably convenient access to the broad range of services that the managed care plan offers. Therefore, managed care plans must develop and maintain sufficient numbers and types of providers to meet member health care needs in a geographic area. In addition, most network physicians must remain open to accepting as patients those members who are new to the plan as well as those who may wish to change providers. As a result, most plans maintain active recruitment and management programs to make sure that their networks keep pace with the needs of their ever-changing member populations in the areas and regions where these members reside. However, competition for members frequently requires managed care plans to expand their networks to offer members a choice of physicians, specialists, and hospitals beyond that required by scope of service and convenience alone.\n\nProvider Compensation\n             A major objective of managed care plans is cost containment through the efficient use of health care resources. The method of provider compensation is one major component of this objective.\n\n             Providers are willing to grant preferred rates to managed care plans because as participants in the plan's network they anticipate an increased number of patients who will utilize their services. Or conversely, they will not lose patients to providers who are network providers. The specific payment method for network providers varies by the type of provider and the negotiating strength of the plan. However, the managed care plan's objective remains the same under any payment arrangement: to control the price of services and the overall increase in the cost of services utilized.\n\n             The compensation for services is determined by agreement in advance of the provision of services and a plan cannot change it for a specified period without notification. It also usually requires the agreement of each party. An important part of the contract with a provider outlines the provider's obligation to accept the agreed-upon amount as payment in full, except for copayments and other clearly identified amounts which the provider must collect from plan members.\n\n              The payment method also intends, if possible, to have providers participate to some degree in the increased cost of services utilized either through incentive payments for meeting utilization targets or penalties for failure to do so. The payment methods managed care plans use include capitation, modification of the traditional fee-for-service payment system, and per-day and per-case rates.\n\n\nCapitation\ncapitation\t\t\n              Although far from dominant, the payment method historically associated with managed care plans is capitation. HMOs frequently employ this method for the payment of primary care physicians if each HMO member is required to select or is assigned a primary care physician who is responsible for the member's care. Primary care physicians provide members with basic health care services and coordinate additional care needs through referrals to other network physicians for certain medical specialist services. Under capitation, these physicians receive a fixed payment per month for each member without regard to the services a member may receive in any particular month. These rates reflect likely utilization of services by the plan's members based on age and gender and the cost of care in the area. Capitation provides physicians no financial incentives to overtreat patients.\n\n\nincentive payment program\nwithhold arrangement\n              In conjunction with capitation, a managed care plan commonly establishes an incentive payment program that rewards physicians who meet budgeted cost and utilization levels for hospital and ancillary services. This program may include other criteria such as meeting member satisfaction and quality standards. Such an incentive program is called a withhold arrangement if it imposes financial penalties or decreases compensation for failure to meet these same criteria.\n\n              HMOs may also use capitation in some cases for the payment of specialty physicians and services such as substance abuse care and chronic condition management. Although infrequent, payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services may also use capitation.\n\n\nModified Fee-For-Service Payments\nmodifiedfee-for-service payment system\n              Despite the cost containment advantages of capitation,\na modified fee-for-service payment system is the dominant method for compensating physicians in managed care plans. Many specialty physicians in managed care plans and most physicians in PPO networks receive payment in this manner. Managed care organizations also occasionally used it with hospitals.\n\n               With this method of compensation, the plan pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, subject to negotiated maximums per procedure. In most cases, this involves a discount from what the physician would charge a patient who did not participate in the managed care plan.\n\n               Modified fee-for-service payment arrangements employed by managed care plans often include some element of physician financial involvement in cost containment through rewards or penalties based on success in achieving the plan's utilization and cost targets. These rewards and penalties are similar to the incentive and withhold arrangements discussed previously under capitation payment.\n\n\nPer-Day and Per-Case Payments\nper-day rate\n                The dominant arrangement used by managed care plans for payment of inpatient hospital services is a negotiated per-day rate. With this approach, a plan pays a hospital a specified amount for each day a plan member is hospitalized, regardless of the actual cost of services on any particular day. The rate usually differs by type or level of care such as intensive care, obstetrics, or rehabilitation. The rate may decrease in relation to the days the member stays in the hospital or the aggregate days of stay for all plan members.\n\nper-case rate\ndiagnosis-related groups\n                 A managed care plan may be able to control costs more effectively by using a per-case rate to pay for hospital stays. With this approach, the plan pays a specified fee for all inpatient costs, regardless of a member's length of stay. This fee is based on such factors as a member's principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, gender, and presence of complications. This system of classification of services is often referred to as diagnosis-related groups.\n\n                 Managed care plans also often use a per-case rate to reimburse hospitals and other providers for nonphysician services that members receive on an outpatient basis.\n"

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider. Unlike HMOs, which determine fees on a per-person basis, however, PPOs determine fees on a per-service basis.\n    The following provider, financial, and customer-service factors should be considered in evaluating PPO performance:\n\nProvider information\n    Provider information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How are providers solicited and screened?\n\u25a1 Are there sufficient network providers for good freedom of choice?\n\u25a1 Are network providers accessible to employees?\n\u25a1 What is the turnover of providers in the program?\n\u25a1 Are providers generally available or are there special schedules?\n\u25a1 What providers are in the network, and are they the same providers employees use?\n\nFinancial information\n    Financial information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How long has the PPO been in existence?\n\u25a1 Is the sponsor financially sound?\n\u25a1 Are there administrative costs?\n\u25a1 What is the effect on insurance premiums?\n\u25a1 How much are the provider discounts?\n\u25a1 Are there utilization controls to prevent PPOs from making fraudulent claims or providing unnecessary services?\n\u25a1 Has credentialing been sought?\n\nCustomer service factors\n    Customer service factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 Does the sponsor help market the program to employees?\n\u25a1 Are there special program features for emergencies or information?\n\u25a1 Are the program mechanics convenient and easy for employees to use?\n\u25a1 How are problems resolved?\n"

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider. Unlike HMOs, which determine fees on a per-person basis, however, PPOs determine fees on a per-service basis.\n    The following provider, financial, and customer-service factors should be considered in evaluating PPO performance:\n\nProvider information\n    Provider information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How are providers solicited and screened?\n\u25a1 Are there sufficient network providers for good freedom of choice?\n\u25a1 Are network providers accessible to employees?\n\u25a1 What is the turnover of providers in the program?\n\u25a1 Are providers generally available or are there special schedules?\n\u25a1 What providers are in the network, and are they the same providers employees use?\n\nFinancial information\n    Financial information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How long has the PPO been in existence?\n\u25a1 Is the sponsor financially sound?\n\u25a1 Are there administrative costs?\n\u25a1 What is the effect on insurance premiums?\n\u25a1 How much are the provider discounts?\n\u25a1 Are there utilization controls to prevent PPOs from making fraudulent claims or providing unnecessary services?\n\u25a1 Has credentialing been sought?\n\nCustomer service factors\n    Customer service factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 Does the sponsor help market the program to employees?\n\u25a1 Are there special program features for emergencies or information?\n\u25a1 Are the program mechanics convenient and easy for employees to use?\n\u25a1 How are problems resolved?\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Provider Networks\n\nprovider network\t\n         Networks of providers of health care services and the contracts that establish them are essential to managed care plans. These plans manage care primarily through the provider network that members in the plan are encouraged to use. Members may be required to receive covered medical care services from network providers only, or they must use these providers in order to obtain full plan benefits. To be successful, a managed care plan must create and maintain provider networks that do the following:\n\u2022 contain qualified providers of health care services\n\u2022 meet member needs for medical care services\n\u2022 compensate network providers in a manner that encourages efficient use of resources\n\n\nQualified Providers of Health Care Services\ncredentials\t\n          Managed care plans specify the qualifications, known as credentials, that providers must have and maintain to be a network participant. Physicians, for example, must document their training, licensure, certification in a specialty, and malpractice insurance coverage. In addition, they must be free of limitations, suspensions, or impairments that would affect their practice of medicine and hospital admitting privileges. Hospitals and other institutions must be licensed, accredited, and approved for participation in the Medicare program. Generally, a credentialing verification organization hired by the managed care plan obtains the information to determine if a provider has the qualifications that the plan requires. The plan repeats the credentialing process periodically to make sure that network providers continue to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMember Needs for Medical Care Services\n           A managed care plan's provider network must encompass the broad scope of health services that members may need and be conveniently accessible to those members.\n\n           Network providers include physicians, hospitals and other institutions, diagnostic radiology and laboratory services, and therapy services. Among the other institutions in a network are facilities that provide outpatient care, including surgery, rehabilitation, and skilled-nursing care. Although a few managed care plans may hire their health care professionals and own their facilities, most managed care plans establish their networks through contracts with providers. These providers may be solo practitioners or participate in various types of groups under a variety of organizational structures. A provider often participates in several networks and also treats patients who are not members of managed care plans. Plans may also contract with specialty care organizations for specific services. These services may include psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, radiology, laboratory and pathology services, transplant surgeries, and prescription drug services.\n\n             Networks need to allow members to have reasonably convenient access to the broad range of services that the managed care plan offers. Therefore, managed care plans must develop and maintain sufficient numbers and types of providers to meet member health care needs in a geographic area. In addition, most network physicians must remain open to accepting as patients those members who are new to the plan as well as those who may wish to change providers. As a result, most plans maintain active recruitment and management programs to make sure that their networks keep pace with the needs of their ever-changing member populations in the areas and regions where these members reside. However, competition for members frequently requires managed care plans to expand their networks to offer members a choice of physicians, specialists, and hospitals beyond that required by scope of service and convenience alone.\n\nProvider Compensation\n             A major objective of managed care plans is cost containment through the efficient use of health care resources. The method of provider compensation is one major component of this objective.\n\n             Providers are willing to grant preferred rates to managed care plans because as participants in the plan's network they anticipate an increased number of patients who will utilize their services. Or conversely, they will not lose patients to providers who are network providers. The specific payment method for network providers varies by the type of provider and the negotiating strength of the plan. However, the managed care plan's objective remains the same under any payment arrangement: to control the price of services and the overall increase in the cost of services utilized.\n\n             The compensation for services is determined by agreement in advance of the provision of services and a plan cannot change it for a specified period without notification. It also usually requires the agreement of each party. An important part of the contract with a provider outlines the provider's obligation to accept the agreed-upon amount as payment in full, except for copayments and other clearly identified amounts which the provider must collect from plan members.\n\n              The payment method also intends, if possible, to have providers participate to some degree in the increased cost of services utilized either through incentive payments for meeting utilization targets or penalties for failure to do so. The payment methods managed care plans use include capitation, modification of the traditional fee-for-service payment system, and per-day and per-case rates.\n\n\nCapitation\ncapitation\t\t\n              Although far from dominant, the payment method historically associated with managed care plans is capitation. HMOs frequently employ this method for the payment of primary care physicians if each HMO member is required to select or is assigned a primary care physician who is responsible for the member's care. Primary care physicians provide members with basic health care services and coordinate additional care needs through referrals to other network physicians for certain medical specialist services. Under capitation, these physicians receive a fixed payment per month for each member without regard to the services a member may receive in any particular month. These rates reflect likely utilization of services by the plan's members based on age and gender and the cost of care in the area. Capitation provides physicians no financial incentives to overtreat patients.\n\n\nincentive payment program\nwithhold arrangement\n              In conjunction with capitation, a managed care plan commonly establishes an incentive payment program that rewards physicians who meet budgeted cost and utilization levels for hospital and ancillary services. This program may include other criteria such as meeting member satisfaction and quality standards. Such an incentive program is called a withhold arrangement if it imposes financial penalties or decreases compensation for failure to meet these same criteria.\n\n              HMOs may also use capitation in some cases for the payment of specialty physicians and services such as substance abuse care and chronic condition management. Although infrequent, payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services may also use capitation.\n\n\nModified Fee-For-Service Payments\nmodifiedfee-for-service payment system\n              Despite the cost containment advantages of capitation,\na modified fee-for-service payment system is the dominant method for compensating physicians in managed care plans. Many specialty physicians in managed care plans and most physicians in PPO networks receive payment in this manner. Managed care organizations also occasionally used it with hospitals.\n\n               With this method of compensation, the plan pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, subject to negotiated maximums per procedure. In most cases, this involves a discount from what the physician would charge a patient who did not participate in the managed care plan.\n\n               Modified fee-for-service payment arrangements employed by managed care plans often include some element of physician financial involvement in cost containment through rewards or penalties based on success in achieving the plan's utilization and cost targets. These rewards and penalties are similar to the incentive and withhold arrangements discussed previously under capitation payment.\n\n\nPer-Day and Per-Case Payments\nper-day rate\n                The dominant arrangement used by managed care plans for payment of inpatient hospital services is a negotiated per-day rate. With this approach, a plan pays a hospital a specified amount for each day a plan member is hospitalized, regardless of the actual cost of services on any particular day. The rate usually differs by type or level of care such as intensive care, obstetrics, or rehabilitation. The rate may decrease in relation to the days the member stays in the hospital or the aggregate days of stay for all plan members.\n\nper-case rate\ndiagnosis-related groups\n                 A managed care plan may be able to control costs more effectively by using a per-case rate to pay for hospital stays. With this approach, the plan pays a specified fee for all inpatient costs, regardless of a member's length of stay. This fee is based on such factors as a member's principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, gender, and presence of complications. This system of classification of services is often referred to as diagnosis-related groups.\n\n                 Managed care plans also often use a per-case rate to reimburse hospitals and other providers for nonphysician services that members receive on an outpatient basis.\n"

Like an HMO, the insurance company negotiates discounts with physicians and the hospitals and adds them to its \"network\" of providers. Employees enrolled in a PPO plan are encouraged to choose doctors and hospitals from the network. Employees who do choose providers from withing the network usually pay a set amount per office visit (typically $10 to $30) with the insurance company paying the rest.\n\n                        Unlike an HMO, PPO networks are generally smaller and you can see a specialist without having to see a Primary Care Physician (PCP) first. Also, you can see a physician outside of the network and you'll probably have your cost covered (although likely at a lower rate than for in-network physicians). However, premiums are usually higher than in HMOs and it's usual to have a deductible amount you have to meet each plan year before coverage kicks in.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 438 - Health Benefits - Health Delivery Systems - Point-of-Service Plans\n\n    The point-of-service (POS) plan, sometimes known as an open-ended HMO, allows members to elect to use non-HMO providers, including physicians and hospitals, under varying circumstances. Thus, members are not locked in as in the case of a traditional HMO where members must seek health care from the HMO's physicians and hospitals.\n    Pointer: POS plans attempt to bridge the gap between the full benefits of an HMO and the freedom of choice of providers associated with PPOs and indemnity plans while closely managing services and financial arrangements.\n    Unlike traditional HMOs, however, POS plans can be exclusive arrangements in which employers enroll the entire work force.\n    Costs. POS plans usually result in higher costs for employees through deductibles and coinsurance. Traditional HMOs, on the other hand, generally have limited or no deductibles or coinsurance.\n    The POS plan maintains some of the traditional HMO framework of managed care while expanding the enrollee's choice of providers. A POS network of doctors is available to offer both primary care and specialty services on a contractual basis to the HMO enrollees and agrees to provide services at a negotiated rate.\n    Typical procedures. Essentially, the employee and dependents select a primary care physician who is an HMO doctor. This physician acts as a gatekeeper who oversees delivery of all services within the HMO. The employee, however, may select a provider other than one recommended by the gatekeeper at the point of service.\n    If the employee selects an HMO physician, the employee remains covered under the HMO levels of benefits. If, however, he or she selects a non-HMO physician, the employee receives reimbursement at a reduced level that includes deductibles and copayments.\n    Pointer: This is unlike a traditional HMO. In a traditional HMO, when an employee seeks services outside of the HMO, the employee generally is not eligible for any coverage from or reimbursement by either the HMO or an indemnity plan, unless it is an emergency.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 8 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Understanding Behavioral Health Care Benefits - Care Management and Cost Control\n        Care management and cost control include items such as care access, pre\u00ad dictive modeling and assessment, performance measurement, outcomes management, and coordination of care.\n\nCare Access\n         MBHOs traditionally require preauthorization to access treatment. MBHOs generally operate their own customer service centers, and when a member calls for a referral, an intake specialist asks the member a series of questions to establish the reason for the call, assess risk, acuity, specialty needs, and member preference. After listening to the caller's concerns and explaining the nature of the caller's benefits, the intake specialist separates routine from urgent and emergency situations. More than 80 percent of incoming calls are generally for routine referrals; industry standards dictate that members receiving routine referrals must be seen by a provider within 10 business days. If a member's needs are urgent, an appointment is arranged within 48 hours, although the more stringent standard of 24 hours is adopted for some contracts. If an individual requires immediate, emergency services (e.g., he or she is suicidal or homicidal), referral is generally made to a hospital or inpatient facility if an immediate appointment is not available with a network practitioner. Most MBHOs employ a dedicated team of licensed crisis care managers, who are specially trained in emergency protocol, active listening, diffusing, and referral. Ambulance services and/or police may also be involved in diffusing hostile situations and transferring an individual to psychiatric facilities.\n\nPredictive Modeling and Risk Assessment\n         High-service utilizers-generally individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major recurrent depression\u00adrepresent a small percentage of overall service users but account for a disproportionate, higher pen;:entage of treatment resources and claims costs. MBHOs analyze claims and treatment data to identify high-risk members who have a history of high utilization and repeated hospitalizations. Predictive modeling techniques provide the ability to forecast who those high-risk, potentially high-cost members are, and intervene in time to avoid preventable treatment costs. The degree of risk can be identified and members stratified accordingly, so care management resources can be applied most effectively and efficiently. MBHO care management resources tend to be in short supply, so it pays to use those limited resources to deliver the best clinical and economic value to both the member and the payer.\n\nPerformance Measurement\n        MBHOs typically measure provider network performance through a num\u00ad ber of variables, which include accessibility, utilization, and adequacy and appropriateness of treatment. Traditionally, these performance data are collected after the fact through provider assessment reports and claims data. Today, however, some MBHOs are collecting member-reported and provider-reported data earlier on in the process to guide timely treatment interventions that can avert unnecessary emergency hospitalizations and contribute to more effective treatment outcomes. Profiling provider performance on clinical outcomes is an important step forward in the performance measurement arena.\n\nCase Management\n        Case management is a term that refers to oversight of an MBHO member's treatment to ensure it is appropriate. Case managers employed by the MBHO coordinate the member's care in collaboration with treating providers, facilities, and community resources, and often work with members and their families to ensure they continue to receive the appropriate level of care for their fluctuating needs. This ensures a cost-effective course of treatment in an appropriate setting. Potentially high service utilizers are identified so case managers can focus on those individuals with the greatest needs to ensure they continually receive appropriate treatment levels. Most MBHOs use an escalating series of models or protocols based on the patient's level of acuity and chronicity, which determine how frequently case managers monitor treatment. Case management goals are crisis stabi\u00ad lization, prevention of long-term disability, and reduced reliance on hospital care by facilitating patient engagement in outpatient treatment and community resources.\n\nUtilization Review and Management\n       Utilization review is an activity that determines the medical necessity and appropriateness of treatment being provided, and is performed at various times, including at the point of care (prospective review), during care (concurrent review), and after treatment (retrospective review). While MBHOs generally perform this function, self-funded employers and health plans may purchase this service from stand-alone utilization review organizations. MBHOs utilize written criteria based on clinical evidence to guide the evaluation of the medical necessity, appropriateness, and efficiency of mental health and chemical dependency services.\n\nOutcomes Management\n      MBHOs have developed tools to assess treatment effectiveness and quantify outcomes, bringing technology, data, and increased objectivity to a field once dominated by subjective assessment. The measurement of outcomes concurrent with the treatment process is the most powerful approach to outcomes management because feedback to clinicians can shape care as it is being delivered. The objectives of outcomes management are to identify risks early so treatment interventions contribute to more positive outcomes, as well as prevent emergencies and unnecessary hospitalizations. \n\nCoordination of Care\n     Behavioral disorders often coexist with each other (e.g., depression and substance abuse), and with medical disorders (e.g., depression and chronic heart disease). An individual may be seeing his or her primary care doctor for treatment of a physical disorder and a behavioral specialist for treatment of a mental disorder. Coordination of medical and behavioral health care services results in improved treatment outcomes for patients. When coordination of care does not take place, there are increased risks, such as repeated or unnecessary testing and adverse drug reactions. A consumer in today's complex health care environment is faced with a mind-boggling array of organizations, programs, services, and providers, each of which can play a vital role in his or her care and successful recovery. Patients benefit from an interconnected series of care coordination protocols between behavioral health specialists, primary care/medical doctors, medical plans, MBHOs, pharmacy benefit managers, and community affiliates. Health care accrediting and regulatory bodies are pressing the managed care industry to integrate behavioral care into medical delivery systems. Even though progress has been made, much work is needed to create a truly integrated health care system.\n\nDepression Disease Management Programs\n      Depression is a mental illness that often goes unnoticed, and it co-occurs with many physical illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease. It is increasingly a focus of disease management initiatives because of its chronic nature and large economic impact. MBHO depression disease management programs support the clinician-patient relationship and plan of care, and emphasize prevention of disease-related exacerbations and complications using evidence-based guidelines and patient empowerment tools. These programs require coordination among health plans, physicians, pharmacists, and patients. Disease management can improve patient outcomes and quality of life while potentially reducing overall health care costs. \n\nSubstance Abuse Relapse Programs\n        Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is a chronic condition, characterized by relapses. Therefore, the prevention of relapse is one of the critical elements in successful treatment. Standard chemical dependency treatment was once a 28-day inpatient treatment program. Since detoxification on an outpatient basis is more often recommended today, only persons with severe withdrawal and other medical complications now require hospitalization. Most substance abuse treatment experts today consider intensive outpatient treatment more effective for most patients in treating chemical dependency. Outpatient programs encourage individuals to remain sober while confronting their day-to\u00adday living situations. In addition, most MBHOs today offer after-care programs to their members who complete a course of chemical dependency treatment. The programs are aimed at preventing relapse and often include telephonic support and self-help tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 400 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Mental Health Benefits\n\n    Most states require insurers to provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment. Most larger employers offer mental health coverage, but on a more restrictive basis than for other conditions.\n    As is true for substance abuse treatment (see KB-1 Topic 405), coverage for mental health treatment often carries specific limits for:\n\u25a1 days of care per year and lifetime;\n\u25a1 dollars to be reimbursed;\n\u25a1 number of hospital stays per year and on a lifetime basis;\n\u25a1 number of outpatient visits per year and on a lifetime basis; and\n\u25a1 annual or lifetime limits on total mental health benefits provided.\n    Pointer: EAPs (see KB-1 Topic 1100) can help employers to reduce mental health care costs.\n\nMental health parity\n    Under the federal Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), health plans that have lifetime or annual limits on what the plans will spend for medical or surgical services must either include services for mental illness in their total limit or maintain a separate limit for mental illness that is no more restrictive than the medical/surgical limit (Reference 1 below).\n    The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), as set forth in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) adds financial requirements and treatment limitations to the existing mental health parity provisions and expressly adds substance use disorder to the coverage of the parity provisions (Reference 2 below). Group plans that provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits must apply the financial requirements for both benefits equally. Financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance addiction should not be more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to other health benefits and there should be no separate cost sharing requirements or treatment limitations applicable only to mental health or substance addiction benefits.\n    Financial requirement and treatment limitation. \"Financial requirement\" includes deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket expenses, but excludes the existing aggregate lifetime limit and an annual limit under the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA and PHSA. A financial requirement or treatment limit is considered \"predominant\" if it is the most common of such type of limit or requirement. \"Treatment limitation\" includes limits on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment (Reference 3 below). \n    The general parity requirement prohibits a plan (or health insurance coverage) from applying any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the \"predominant\" financial requirement or treatment limitation applied to \"substantially all\" medical/surgical benefits in the same classification. The general parity requirement applies separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation (that is, for example, copayments are compared to copayments, and deductibles to deductibles) (Reference 4 below).\n    The parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations are applied on a classification-by-classification basis. There are six exclusive classifications used for purposes of satisfying the parity requirements: inpatient, in\u00adnetwork; inpatient, out-of-network; outpatient, in-network; outpatient, out-of-net\u00adwork; emergency care; and prescription drugs. If a plan provides any benefits for a mental health condition or substance use disorder, benefits must be provided in each classification for which any medical/surgical benefits are provided (Reference 5 below).\n    The portion of plan payments subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (such as day limits, visit limits, frequency of treatment limits) is based on the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the plan for the plan year. Any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under the plan for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.\n    The first step in applying the general parity requirement is to determine whether a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to \"substantially all\" medical/surgical benefits in a classification. A financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification if it applies to at least two-thirds of the benefits in that classification. If a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of the medical surgical benefits, that type of requirement or limitation cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits (Reference 6 below).\n    The Labor Department (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the IRS have provided further clarification by specifically stating that the criteria for making medical necessity determinations, as well as any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in developing the underlying nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTL) and in applying it, must be disclosed with respect to both mental health and substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits, regardless of any assertions as to the proprietary nature or commercial value of the information (Reference 7 below).\n    In addition, although not required to do so, group health plans and issuers can provide a document that provides a description of the medical necessity criteria in layperson's terms. However, providing such a summary document is not a substitute for providing the actual underlying medical necessity criteria, if such documents are requested (Reference 8 below).\n    Opioid use disorder benefits. A plan may not impose a prior authorization requirements more stringently on drugs used for opioid treatment disorders than it imposes on prescription drugs used to treat medical/surgical conditions that carry similar safety risks (Reference 9 below). In addition, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors consider by a plan in designing and imposing a fail-first requirement for drugs used to treat opioid use disorders must be comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors used to apply fail-first requirements for medical/surgical benefits (Reference 10 below). Also, if a plan follows nationally-recognized treatment guidelines for setting prior authorization requirements for prescription drugs, but requires prior authorization for opioid treatment disorder prescription drugs every 30 days, at refill, it is violating the MHPAEA, because nationally-recognized treatment guidelines, such as those of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASA) do not support 30-day authorization practices for such opioid disorder treatment medications as buprenorphine/naloxone (Reference 11 below).\n    Experimental treatment DOL FAQs issued in September 2019 address whether it is permissible for a plan to deny claims for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy to treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder under the rationale that the treatment is experimental or investigative. With respect to medical/ surgical conditions, the plan approved treatment when supported by one or more professionally recognized treatment guidelines and two or more controlled random\u00ad ized trials.\n    A medical management standard limiting or excluding benefits based on whether a treatment is experimental or investigative is an NQTL under MHPAEA. Although the plan as written purports to exclude experimental or investigative treatment for both MH/SUD and medicai/surgical benefits using the same standards, in practice, it imposes this exclusion more stringently on MH/SUD benefits, as the plan denies all claims for ABA therapy, despite the fact that professionally recognized treatment guidelines and the requisite number of randomized controlled trials support the use of ABA therapy to treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Accordingly, because the plan applies the NQTL more stringently to mental health benefits than to medical/surgical benefits, the plan's exclusion of ABA therapy as experimental does not cotriply with MHPAEA (Reference 12 below).\n    Likewise, a plan does not comply with the MHPAEA where it defines experimental or investigative treatments as those with a rating below \"B\" in the Hayes Medical Technology Directory, but the plan reviews and covers certain treatments for medical/surgical conditions that have a rating of \"C\" on a treatment-by-treatment basis, while denying all benefits for MH/SUD treatment that have a rating of \"C\" or below, without reviewing the treatments to determine whether exceptions are appropriate. Although the text of the plan sets forth the same evidentiary standard for defining experimental as the Hayes Medical Directory ratings below \"B,\" the plan applies a different evidentiary standard, which is more stringent for MH/SUD benefits than for medical surgical benefits because the unconditional exclusion of treatments with a \"C\" rating for MH/SUD benefits is not comparable to the conditional exclusion of those treatments with a \"C\" rating for medical/surgical benefits. Because of the discrepant application of the evidentiary standard used by the plan, the fact that the plan ultimately denies some medical/surgical benefits that have a rating of \"C\" does not justify the total exclusion of treatments with a \"C\" rating for MH/SUD  (Reference 13 below).\n    Dosage limits. A plan does not comply with MHPAEA where it follows professionally-recognized treatment guidelines when setting dosage limits for prescription medications, but the dosage limit set by the plan for buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder is less than what professionally-recognized treatment guidelines generally recommend. However, the dosage limits set by the plan with respect to medical/surgical benefits are not less than the limits such treatment guidelines recommend. If the plan follows the dosage recommendations in professionally-recognized treatment guidelines to set dosage limits for prescription drugs in its formulary to treat medical/surgical conditions, it must also follow comparable treatment guidelines, and apply them no more stringently, in setting dosage limits for prescription drugs, including buprenorphine, to treat MH/SUD conditions (Reference 14 below).\n    Particular condition or disorder. A large group health plan or large group insurance coverage that provides benefits for prescription drugs to treat both medical/surgical and MH/SUD conditions but contains a general exclusion for items and services to treat a specific mental health condition, including prescription drugs, is permissible under the MHPAEA although if the plan is insured, it would depend on whether state law permits such an exclusion for large group insurance coverage. Generally, MHPAEA requires that treatment limitations imposed on MH/SUD benefits cannot be more restrictive than treatment limitations that apply to medical and surgical benefits. An exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder, however, is not a treatment limitation for purposes of the definition of \"treatment limitations\" in the MHPAEA regulations. Small employer group health insurance coverage and individual health insurance coverage are subject to the requirement to provide essential health benefits, and the determination of whether certain benefits must be covered under the requirements for essential health benefits depends on the benefits in the applicable State's ERB benchmark plan (Reference 15 below).\n    Step therapy. DOL FAQs also address a situation where a health plan requires step therapy for both medical/surgical and MH/SUD in-patient, in-net\u00adwork benefits. The plan requires a participant to have two unsuccessful attempts at outpatient treatment in the past 12 months to be eligible for certain inpatient in\u00ad network SUD benefits. However, the plan only requires one unsuccessful attempt at outpatient treatment in the past 12 months to be eligible for inpatient, in-network medical/ surgical benefits.\n    This is probably not permissible under the MHPAEA, according to the FAQs, because refusing to pay for a higher-cost therapy until it is shown that a lower-cost therapy is not effective (commonly known as \"step therapy protocols\" or \"fail-first policies\") is an NQTL. Although the same NQTL- step therapy- is applied to both MH/SUD benefits and medical/surgical benefits for eligibility for inpatient, in\u00adnetwork services, the requirement for two attempts at outpatient treatment to be eligible for inpatient; in-network SUD benefits is a more stringent application of the NQTL than the requirement for one attempt at outpatient treatment to be eligible for inpatient, in-network medical/surgical benefits. Unless the plan can demonstrate that evidentiary standards or other factors were utilized comparably to develop and apply the differing step therapy requirements for these MH/SUD and medical/surgical benefits, this NQTL does not comply with the MHPAEA (Reference 16 below).\n    Reimbursement rates. A plan also does not comply with the MHPAEA where its plan documents state that in-network provider reimbursement rates are determined based on the providers' required training, licensure, and expertise. However, medical/surgical benefits, reimbursement rates are generally the same for physicians and non-physician practitioners. For MH/SUD benefits, the plan pays reduced reimbursement rates for non-physician practitioners. While a plan is not required to pay identical provider reimbursement rates for medical/surgical and MH/SUD providers, a plan's standards for admitting a provider to participate in a network (including the plan's reimbursement rates for providers) is an NQTL (Reference 17 below).\n    Provider admission to network. DOL FAQs also address standards for provider admission to participate in a network. Such standards are an NQTL. Thus, in setting standards for provider admission to a network, where a plan's process to ensure the plan considers network adequacy with respect to providers of medical/ surgical services is not comparable to its process with respect to providers of MH/ SUD services, the plan does not comply with the MHPAEA To comply with MHPAEA, if the plan takes steps to ensure the plan has an adequate number of in\u00adnetwork medical/surgical providers, the plan must take comparable steps to ensure an adequate number of in-network MH/SUD providers, even if, following those steps, ultimately there are disparate numbers of MH/SUD and medical/surgical providers in the plan's network (Reference 18 below).\n    Non-hospital residential treatment for eating disorders. A plan also does not comply with the MHPAEA where it covers inpatient, out-of-network treatment outside a hospital for medical/surgical conditions so long as a prescribing physician obtains prior authorization from the plan, the treatment is medically appropriate for the individual, and the facility meets the licensing and certification requirements set by the plan, while the plan unequivocally excludes all inpatient, out-of-network treatment outside a hospital (in this FAQ, non-hospital residential treatment) for eating disorders. This restriction on non-hospital residential treatment for eating disorders is not comparable to the plan's coverage restrictions for inpatient treatment outside a hospital for medical/surgical conditions, which are less stringent (Reference 19 below).\n    Out-of-network providers. If a plan offers out-of-network benefits for medical or surgical care, it must also offer out-of-network coverage for mental health and addiction treatment and provide services at parity (Reference 20 below).\n    Availability of plan information. The criteria for medical necessity determinations made under a plan as well as any denial of reimbursement or payment of services with respect to mental health or substance addiction benefits must be made available to a current or potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request (Reference 21 below). Plans that are subject to ERISA must provide the reason for the claim denial in a form and manner consistent with the rules for group health plans in the ERISA claims procedure regulations, which provide (among other things) that such disclosures must be provided automatically and free of charge. In the case of non-federal governmental and church plans (which are not subject to ERISA), compliance with the form and manner of the ERISA claims procedure regulations for group health plans satisfies this disclosure requirement (Reference 22 below).\n    Cost exemption. An employer may elect to apply mental health and substance addiction parity regardless of any increase in total cost. Generally, mental health and substance addiction parity will not apply if actual costs of coverage with respect to mental health and substance addiction benefits exceed two percent during the first plan year under the new law and one percent in each subsequent plan year, as determined and certified by a qualified and licensed actuary (Reference 23 below). The actuary should be a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries and the determination should be in a written report. A plan that qualifies for a cost exemption and elects to implement the exemption shall promptly notify the appropriate Secretary (of the Treasury, Labor or Health and Human Services), the appropriate state agencies, and the participants and beneficiaries.\n\nExceptions\n    Businesses with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the federal mental health parity requirement. The EESA (see discussion above) revises the small employer exemption and provides that the term \"small employer\" means, with respect to a calendar year and a plan year, an employer who employed an average of at least 2 (or 1 in the case of an employer residing in a state that permits small groups to include a single individual) but not more than 50 employees on business days during the preceding calendar year (Reference 24 below).\n    Pointer: The mental health parity rule involves only annual and lifetime limits. It does not require health plans to offer mental health coverage.\n\nPenalty for noncompliance\n    A $100 per day penalty is imposed on employers whose group health plans fail to comply with the mental health parity provisions (Reference 25 below). The penalty is imposed for each day a failure occurs, until it is corrected and applies separately for each individual affected by the failure to comply. However, no penalty is imposed if the failure to comply is unintentional and corrected within 30 days after it is discovered (or should have been discovered). The penalty is limited for unintentional failures to the lesser of (1) 10 percent of the group health plan's expenses for the prior year or (2) $500,000 per tax year.\n\n\"Red flags\" that could mean your plan lacks parity\n    In June 2016, in response to requests for examples that should trigger careful analysis of coverage to determine MHPAEA compliance, the EBSA issued the following list of provisions that can serve as a red flag that a plan or issuer may be imposing an impermissible NQTL (Reference 26 below). The EBSA has stated that these terms do not, of course, automatically violate the law, but adds that the plan or issuer will need to provide evidence of compliance.\n    Also, the following categories are not exhaustive, and they are subordinate to any departmental regulations or interpretive guidance:\n    Preauthorization and pre-service notification requirements. This includes blanket preauthorization requirements and treatment facility admission preauthorization requirements such as requirements of precertification for inpatient mental health treatment. It also includes situations in which a plan's medical management program delegates its review authority to attending physicians for medical and surgical benefits, but does its own reviews for MH/SUD services, and extensive pre-notification requirements.\n    Fail-first protocols. This can include progress requirements, for which a plan requires, for coverage of intensive outpatient treatment for MH/SUD, that a patient has not achieved progress with non-intensive outpatient treatment of less frequency. Also included are treatment attempt requirements, which could include a requirement that a member first attempt two forms of outpatient treatment, or, for any inpatient MH/SUD services, that an individual first complete a partial hospitalization treatment program.\n    Probability of improvement. This could include situations in which a plan only covers services that result in measurable and substantial improvement in mental health status within 90 days.\n    Written treatment plan required. This could include requirements that a written treatment plan be prescribed and supervised by a behavioral health provider, that a treatment plan be submitted within a certain time period, or that a treatment plan submission is made on a regular basis.\n    Other. This includes provisions for patient non-compliance, such as excluding services for chemical dependency if someone fails to comply with a plan of treatment, plus residential treatment limits, geographical limitations, and licensure requirements.\n\nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Sec. 712, as added by P.L. 104-204.

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 8 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Understanding Behavioral Health Care Benefits - Future Developments in Behavioral Health Care\n          While many Americans need mental health treatment, only about 36 per\u00ad cent of American adults with mental disorders are receiving treatment. (Reference 16 below) \n          Some of the reasons for this are cost, lack of insurance, stigma, and not understanding what behavioral insurance covers. Although the stigma associated with mental health care is fading, some individuals are still concerned that employers, coworkers, or friends will think less of them for seeing a therapist. Others are skeptical that therapy is effective and actually solves problems. And some people simply cannot find, or do not know how to find, a therapist who works well with them.\n          The costs for not accessing needed behavioral treatment are many. Depression can complicate a patient's recovery from a major illness. Patients with chronic or serious mental illnesses who do not have appropriate outpatient care can bounce in and out of inpatient facilities, while families and patients suffer from poor outcomes and mounting insurance bills. Finally, lack of care can lead to the most serious outcome possible: death of the patient through suicide.\n\nBroadening Care Access\n         Radical new approaches to reaching those in need of mental health care are needed-and fortunately, are either in development or in use already. They include the following:\n\u25a0 Proactive disease management programs that operate on several fronts: working with employers to reach out to employees through the workplace, and with health plans to identify patients taking psychotropic medications who need additional support; and reaching out to patients with other diseases such as diabetes or cardiac conditions who may also suffer from mental illness.\n\u25a0 Outreach to people who want treatment but do not know how to access it or to find a therapist who is best for them. One's choice of a psychotherapist is primarily impacted by a physician's recommendation, the health plan network, and the location of the clinician's office. Offering information about clinicians online, even identifying those within a network with specializations or a track record of producing the best outcomes, can help people make more informed choices. Just as health plans publish physician \"report cards\" to educate consumers, so psychotherapist report cards might help people choose the best therapist for their needs.\n\u25a0 New ways of delivering therapy that are more accessible and cost effective. For example, patients with mild to moderate levels of distress can benefit from a \"coach\" who offers counseling over the telephone or via the Internet. The Internet can also play an important role in promoting compliance with treatment, and augment other treatment offerings.\n\nProductivity\n         One of the challenges facing managed behavioral health care organizations is the ability to demonstrate to purchasers that the benefits they deliver result in increased workplace productivity. Studies of this type are usually collaborative efforts between an employer group and MBHO, and results are often skewed by nuances of the individual group. In 2003, PacifiCare Behavioral Health, a leading national managed behavioral health care organization, reported the results of a four-year study of nearly 20,000 of its members in behavioral treatment representing multiple employer groups and health plans across the country. By measuring the degree of work impairment through a patient survey tool administered in clinicians' offices at the beginning and at multiple points during psychotherapy, the MBHO was able to track patient improvement. Five questions on the survey assessed degrees of work impairment. The MBHO found that 31 percent of people accessing behavioral services met criteria for being work-impaired-meaning their day-to-day functioning was impaired. After only three weeks of treatment, the percentage of work-impaired patients dropped to 18 percent, and after nine weeks, it dropped to 15 percent. Generally, patients who still appear work-impaired after a few months of treatment are those with chronic behavioral health conditions that need more intensive services with careful monitoring and typically are enrolled in a disease management program.\n\n\nREFERENCE\n\n16.

                    "text": "KB-5 - Group Insurance Pricing - Manual Rating\n\n\tIn the manual-rating process, insurance companies establish premium rates only for broad classes of group insurance business, and they do not consider the past claims experience of a particular group when determining that group's rates. However, claims experience is not entirely ignored, because insurers use the aggregate claims experience for a class of business to determine the premium rates for that class.\n\tInsurers use manual rating with small groups for which no credible individual loss experience is available. This lack of credibility exists because the group's size makes it impossible to determine whether other-than-average loss experience is due to random chance or is truly reflective of the group. Manual rating is also frequently used to determine the initial premiums for groups that are subject to experience rating, particularly when a group's past experience is unobtainable or when a group is being written for the first time. In addition, experience rating typically uses a weighting of manual rates and the actual experience of a group to determine the premium. (Rates for very large groups may be based solely on a group's own experience.)\n\nRating Basis\n\tPrior to the actual calculation of manual premium rates, insurers develop a basis on which the rates are determined. This rating basis involves a decision regarding (1) what benefit unit to use, (2) the extent to which rates are refined by factors affecting claims, and (3) the frequency with which premiums are paid.\n\nBenefit Unit\n\tSubject to certain adjustments, insurers calculate the premium for a group by multiplying the premium rate by the number of benefit units provided. Although variations do occasionally exist, the benefit units predominantly used for the most common types of group insurance are shown in the following table.\n\nTable 15-1 Benefit Units\nType of Group Insurance\tBenefit Unit\nTerm life (including accidental death and dismemberment)\nShort-term disability income Long-term disability income\nMedical expense (including dental)\tEach $1,000 of death benefit\nEach $10 of weekly income Each $100 of monthly income\nEach employee and each category of dependents\n\nFactors Affecting Claims\n\tRates reflect those factors that result in different claims experience for different groups. Although there are variations among insurance companies, the following discussion indicates the factors used by most insurance companies to determine rates for life, disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance.\n\tGender. Gender of insured persons is taken into account for determining rates for all the types of insurance mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\tAge. Age is also used as a rating factor for life insurance, disability income, and medical expense insurance. Dental insurance rates usually do not take age into consideration.\n\tGeographic Location. At one time, geographic location was a rating factor for medical expense insurance and dental insurance only. However, an increasing number of insurance companies use geographic variations for determining life insurance and disability income insurance rates. For these latter types of insurance, rates may not be determined separately for a wide variety of locations. Instead, the insurance company may have only two or three rate schedules, with each schedule applying to several different geographic locations on the basis of past experience.\n\tOccupation. Occupation is virtually always reflected in both life insurance rates and accidental death and dismemberment rates. It may also be reflected in disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance rates. Some companies ignore it as a rating factor but may not write coverage when certain occupations are involved.\n\tIncome. At one time, the income level of group members was commonly used as a factor in establishing disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance rates. Currently, income level is still a factor in determining dental insurance premiums, but it is more likely to be an underwriting consideration only in disability income and medical expense insurance.\n\tSize. The size of a group also affects rates because the proportion of the premium needed for expenses decreases as the size of a group increases. All manual premium rates are based on an assumption that the size of a group falls within a certain range. If the size of a group varies from this range, insurers make an appropriate rate adjustment to reflect this differential. In addition, many insurers reserve the right to rerate a group during the period of the contract or cancel the contract at renewal if the group changes in size by a certain percentage. This is particularly important in an era of downsizing and mergers.\n\tTime. A final factor considered in the calculation of rates is the length of time for which the rates will be in effect. This is a concern primarily for coverages that involve medical and dental claims, which over time are expected to increase in severity because of inflation. In inflationary times, monthly rates that are guaranteed for three months can be lower than those guaranteed for one year.\n\nFrequency of Premium Payment Period\n\tBecause employers usually pay group insurance premiums monthly, insurers generally determine rates for this period. When premiums can be paid less frequently (such as annually), they are usually slightly lower than the sum of the monthly premiums for the same period of coverage. This results from the extra investment earnings the insurer can get by collecting premiums earlier. In addition, the annual expense of processing premiums is lower if employers pay them less frequently.\n\nCalculation of Manual Premium Rates\nmanual premium rate\nfinal premium rate\n\tManual rating involves the calculation of the manual premium rate (also called tabular rate), which is quoted in an insurance company's rate book. The manual rate is applied to a specific group insurance case in order to determine a final premium rate (sometimes called an average premium rate) that is then multiplied by the number of benefit units to obtain a premium for the group.\n\tThere are three manual-rating methods. However, if identical assumptions are used, each method should result in approximately the same premium for any given group. The first method determines separate manual rates for groups with certain characteristics that an insurance company feels affect claims experience. A second approach establishes a single \"standard manual rate\" that is adjusted in the premium-calculation process to compensate for any characteristics that deviate from those of the standard group. A third method merely combines the first two approaches and considers some factors in determining the manual rate and other factors in determining the final premium rate.\n\nnet premium rate\n\tThe first step in the calculation of manual premium rates is the determination of the net premium rate, which is the amount necessary to support the cost of expected claims. For any given classification, the net premium rate is calculated by multiplying the probability (frequency) of a claim occurring by the expected amount (severity) of the claim. For example, if the probability that an employee aged 50 will die in the next month is .0005, then the net monthly premium for each $1,000 of coverage is .0005 x $1,000, or $.50. Because insurers collect premiums before claims are paid, they adjust this figure downward for anticipated interest earnings on these funds.\n\tIn general, insurance companies that write a large volume of any given type of group insurance rely on their own experience in determining the frequency and severity of future claims. Insurance companies that do not have enough past data for reliable future projections can turn to many sources for useful statistics. Probably the major source is the Society of Actuaries (Web site: soa.org), which regularly collects and publishes aggregate data on the group insurance business that is written by a number of large group insurance companies. Other sources of information are industry trade organizations and various agencies of the federal government.\n\nrisk charge\n\tThe second and final step in the calculation of manual premium rates is the adjustment of the net premium rates for expenses, a risk charge, and a contribution to surplus. Expenses include commissions, premium taxes, claims settlement costs, and other costs associated with the acquisition and servicing of group insurance business. The risk charge represents a contribution to the insurance company's contingency reserve as a cushion against unanticipated and catastrophic amounts of claims. The contribution to surplus or net worth represents the profit margin of the insurance company. Although mutual companies are legally nonprofit, they, like stock insurance companies, require a contribution to net worth that is a source of financing for future growth.\n\tFrom the standpoint of equity, the adjustment of the net premium rate is complex. Some factors, such as premium taxes and commissions, vary with the premium charge. However, the size of a group does not affect the premium tax rate, whereas the commission rate generally decreases as the size of a group increases. To a large degree, the expenses of settling claims vary with the number, and not the size, of claims. It costs just as much administratively to pay a $10,000 claim under a group life insurance plan as it does to pay a $100,000 claim. Certain other costs also tend to be fixed regardless of the size of a group. For simplicity, some insurance companies adjust or load their net premium rates by a constant percentage. However, other insurance companies consider the different patterns of expenses by using a percentage plus a constant charge. For example, if the net premium rate is $.60, this might be increased by 20 percent plus $.10 to arrive at a manual premium rate of $.82 (that is, $.60 x 1.2 + $.10). Because neither approach adequately accounts for the difference in expenses as a result of a group's size, another adjustment based on the size of the group is made in the calculation of the final premium rate.\n\nCalculation of Premiums\n\tProbably the best way to explain the actual calculation of group insurance premiums is through examples. The following analysis begins with group term life insurance, then discusses how the structure of manual premium rates and the premium calculation process differ for certain other types of group insurance.\n\nGroup Term Life Insurance\n\tThe mechanics of calculating a final premium rate and the premium for a particular group vary among insurance companies because of the differences in methods of preparing manual premium rates and the process by which insurers make adjustments to these rates.\n\tThe following example begins with the table below, which is an abbreviated version of a set of rates on a monthly basis per $1,000 of coverage at selected ages. As with most rate tables, the ages are those at a person's attained age (nearest birthday).\n\tThese rates are loaded for expenses, and they assume that the coverage contains a waiver-of-premium provision on disabled lives, accidental death and dismemberment coverage, and a conversion privilege. Consequently, rates are higher than if none of these additional benefits were included. When an employee converts coverage to an individual policy, a charge is assessed against the group insurance business of an insurance company to reflect the increased death claims that result from adverse selection on conversions. The amount of this assessment (commonly $50 to $75 per $1,000 of converted insurance) is transferred to the individual insurance department of the company to compensate it for having to write the converted business at too low a rate.\n\nTable 15-2 Term Insurance Rates\nAge at Nearest Birthday\t\nMale Rate\t\nFemale Rate\n20\t$0.16\t$0.10\n25\t0.18\t0.11\n30\t0.21\t0.12\n35\t0.24\t0.15\n40\t0.37\t0.21\n45\t0.48\t0.30\n50\t0.81\t0.48\n55\t1.24\t0.75\n60\t1.87\t1.12\n65\t2.83\t1.70\n70\t4.35\t2.52\n\n\tThe premium-calculation process starts with the determination of an \"unadjusted cost,\" based on a census of the covered employees and the manual rates. For example, assume a firm has 230 employees. For the sake of simplicity, also assume that each of these employees has $25,000 of life insurance and that the group has the age distribution shown in the next table.\n\nTable 15-3 Age Distribution\nAge\tMales\tFemales\n25\t20\t30\n30\t0\t30\n35\t10\t30\n40\t30\t10\n45\t30\t10\n50\t20\t10\n\n\tThe unadjusted cost is then calculated as shown in the following table.\n\nTable 15-4 Calculation of Unadjusted Cost\nAmount of\nNumber\tCoverage\tUnadjusted\nof\t(in\tRate (per\tUnadjusted\nAge  Gender  Employees\tThousands)\tThousand)\tCost\n25\tM\t20\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t$0.18\t$ 90.00\n35\tM\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.24\t60.00\n40\tM\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.37\t277.50\n45\tM\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.48\t360.00\n50\tM\t20\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.81\t405.00\n25\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.11\t82.50\n30\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.12\t90.00\n35\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.15\t112.50\n40\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.21\t52.50\n45\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.30\t75.00\n50\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.48\t120.00\n\t\t\t\tTotal\tunadjusted\tcost\t\t$1,725.00\n\n\tThe second step is to reduce the sum of the unadjusted cost by a percentage based on the volume of a group insurance plan as determined by its monthly premium. This reduction results from the fact that the expenses associated with a group insurance plan decrease on a percentage basis as the size (premium volume) of the plan increases. The next table shows the reductions used in this example (for selected monthly premiums).\n\nTable 15-5 Premium Reductions\nPremium before Reduction\tPercentage Expense Reduction\nUnder $200\t0%\n200-249\t\n\n1,000-1,499\t\n6\n1,500-1,999\t7\n\n60,000-79,999\t\n19\n80,000 and over\t20\n\n\tThus, the initial monthly premium for the group in this example is calculated as follows:\n\nUnadjusted cost\t$1,725.00\nMinus expense reduction (7 percent)\t-120.75\nAdjusted monthly premium\t$1,604.25\n\n\tThe initial monthly premium is also used to calculate the final monthly premium rate per $1,000 of protection for the group:\n\n.\t\tAdjusted monthly premium premium\t-=--------...C.\t:.--\u00ad\nTotal volume(in thousands)\n$1,604.25\n(230 X $25.000)/$1,000\n= $1,604.25\n5750\n= $0.28\n\n\tThis final monthly premium rate (usually rounded to either the nearest cent or one-tenth of a cent) is used throughout the first policy year and is multiplied each month by the amount of insurance in force to calculate the monthly premium due. Adjustments to the final monthly premium rate because of changes in the makeup of employees by age or gender are not made until the beginning of the next policy year as part of the renewal process. Insurance companies generally guarantee the initial rate for at least one year, assuming that there is no change in the benefit structure of the plan. However, 2- and 3-year rate guarantees are not unusual.\n\tManual rates are designed so that insurance companies can write policies for businesses in most industries at those rates. However, they may charge higher rates for employers in industries that they considered hazardous.\nThese increased rates are usually in the form of a surcharge per $1,000 of coverage that is added to the unadjusted cost before the expense reduction percentage is applied. For example, an industry that is expected to have about one death claim per year per 1,000 employees in excess of those assumed in the manual rates might be charged for this excess mortality with a surcharge of $.06 per $1,000 of coverage per month.\n\tTherefore, the adjusted monthly premium is calculated as shown below:\n\nUnadjusted cost\t$1,725.00\nPlus industry surcharge\t+ 345.00\nTotal cost before expense reduction\t$2,070.00\nMinus expense reduction (8 percent)\t- 165.60\nAdjusted monthly premium\t$1,904.40\n\n\tSimilarly, the expectation of two extra death claims per year would result in an added premium of $.12 per $1,000 per month, or $690.\n\tVariations for Large Groups. Insurance companies use the premium\u00ad calculation process discussed above for most groups over a certain size, usually from 10 or more to 50 or more lives, but variations do exist. For example, some insurance companies do not incorporate a charge for a waiver of premium or accidental death and dismemberment coverage into their manual rates. Rather, an extra charge, which usually differs by industry, is added for this coverage. Also, some companies use (and are required to use in a few states) manual rates that vary by age but not gender. These unisex rate tables are based on assumptions about the ratio of males to females in the group. However, insurers usually make an adjustment the premium-calculation process if the actual group ratio differs from this assumption.\n\tSome companies incorporate a level of expenses into their manual rate so that there is no expense reduction for a certain-size group. In the final premium-calculation process, an adjustment is made; larger groups receive an expense reduction and smaller groups receive an expense surcharge. The following is one such table of adjustments.\n\nTable 15-6 Premium Adjustments\nMonthly Premium before Adjustment\tPercentage Adjustment\nUnder $200\t+25%\n200-249\t+22\n\n700-799\t\n+1\n800-999\t0\n\n50,000-74,999\t\n-14\n75,000 and over\t-15\n\n\tVariations for Small Groups. The manual-rating process for small groups, including those written by multiple-employer trusts, differs from that of large groups in several ways. In general, insurers band the manual rates by age, typically in 5-year intervals. The following table is an example of one such monthly rate table for each $1,000 of coverage.\n\nTable 15-7 Banded Rates\nAge at Nearest Birthday\tMale Rate\tFemale Rate\nUnder 30\t$0.24\t$0.10\n30-34\t0.24\t0.13\n35-39\t0.25\t0.15\n40-44\t0.36\t0.20\n4 9\t0.58\t0.36\n50-54\t0.91\t0.54\n55-59\t1.55\t0.79\n60-64\t1.93\t1.02\n65--69\t3.30\t1.81\n70 and over\t6.80\t3.23\n\n\tAn unadjusted cost is developed based on a census of the employees by age and by gender unless unisex rates are used. Because the manual rates are loaded for most expenses, and because the groups written tend to be reasonably close in size, typically no adjustment for size is made. However, to compensate for the expenses of periodic billings, most insurance companies apply a flat fee to all groups, commonly between $10 and $20 per billing. Some companies do not levy this charge if the premium is paid annually. To reflect the administrative costs associated with record keeping, some insurance companies also levy a modest one-time expense charge when a plan adds coverage for a new employee.\n\tFor large groups, the initial monthly premium is used to determine a monthly premium rate that applies for a specified period. In contrast, the monthly premium rate for small groups may be recalculated each month based not only on the volume of insurance but also on changes in the makeup of employees by age and gender (unless unisex rates are used), just as if the group were being newly written. However, most insurance companies do guarantee that the manual rates used when the group was initially written (and any future manual rates applicable to the group) remain applicable for some period, with 12 months being common.\n\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance\n\tAccidental death and dismemberment insurance is usually not written as a separate coverage unless coverage is voluntary. Rather, it is added by an endorsement to a group term insurance contract. A single manual rate typically applies to all employees regardless of age or gender, but it varies depending on whether coverage is written (1) for nonoccupational accidents only or (2) on a 24-hour basis for both nonoccupational and occupational accidents. The rate for nonoccupational coverage generally does not vary by industry and ranges from $.02 to $.05 per $1,000 of principal sum per month. However, the rate for coverage on a 24-hour basis does vary by industry, and although it falls within this same range for low-risk industries, it may be several times higher for hazardous ones. Some companies calculate a separate cost for the accidental death and dismemberment coverage and add it to the charge for the group term life insurance. However, most employers purchase accidental death and dismemberment coverage. As a result, other insurance companies incorporate the cost into the manual rates for group term life insurance, making the principal sum equal to the amount of life insurance protection purchased, and an additional charge is levied only if the employer desires a higher level of accidental death and dismemberment coverage.\n\nDependent Life Insurance\n\tDependent life insurance may be added as additional coverage to a group life insurance contract that provides protection for employees. Because dependent life insurance coverage is usually a modest fixed amount (such as $2,000 on the spouse and $1,000 on each child) that generates a relatively small additional premium, insurers tend to use a very simplified rate structure. However, several variations do exist. Some insurance companies have\na single flat rate, independent of the type or number of dependents, for each employee who has dependent coverage. Other companies have two separate flat rates: one for the spouse's coverage and the other for children's coverage. The rate for the children's coverage is a family rate regardless of the number of children, and it is based upon an average-sized family.\n\tFlat rates are based on the assumption that the group has an average age mix of employees. If the group of employees is older than average, the flat rate for dependent coverage may be adjusted (particularly when it applies to spouses) to reflect the likelihood that the dependents are also above average in age when compared to the dependents of most other groups. A flat rate is commonly used when employees pay the entire cost of dependent coverage. The uniform charge is easy to communicate to employees, and it simplifies the payroll-deduction process for the employer.\n\tSome insurance companies also use a rate for dependent coverage that varies with the employee's age, thereby assuming that older employees have older dependents. Basing the rate on the employee's age may seem illogical, but it is administratively simpler and less expensive than having to determine the ages of dependents. A single variable rate may apply to the total family coverage for the spouse and all children, or it may apply only to the spouse. In this latter case, a flat rate is generally used if coverage for children is also provided.\n\tIt is becoming less common to see dependent life insurance added to the basic group life coverage for an employee. Instead, this coverage is more frequently being written as an employee-pay-all voluntary benefit, with higher amounts of coverage available.\n\nShort-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\tIn addition to varying by age, by gender, and possibly by geographic location, manual rates for short-term disability income insurance also differ according to (1) the maximum benefit period, (2) the length of the waiting period, and (3) the writing of coverage either on a 24-hour basis or only for nonoccupational disabilities.\nSome insurance companies (particularly those for small groups) have only a single standard short-term disability income plan that they sell, and therefore they only need a single manual rate table. On the other hand, some companies allow the employer to exercise a degree of flexibility in designing the plan. Rather than make adjustments to a single rate table, these companies usually have several rate tables. These tables vary by such factors as maximum benefit period (such as 13 or 26 weeks) and waiting period (such as 7 days for all disabilities or 7 days for illnesses and no waiting period for injuries). If they allow any other variations, they make appropriate rate adjustments.\n\tInsurers adjust for the nature of the industry the group represents. Ignoring the occupational injuries and diseases that are covered under workers' compensation, a few occupations are still characterized by higher-than-average disability income claims. As an alternative to a rate adjustment, some insurance companies have underwriting standards that prohibit the writing of coverage for these groups.\n\tUntil the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and various state laws, it was common for insurance companies to have one manual rate for plans that did not provide benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities and another for plans that did provide such benefits. Because most employers can no longer exclude pregnancy as a cause of disability, insurers usually do not publish rates for coverage without this benefit, except for the employers of small groups that still have an option regarding this benefit in many states.\n\tIn contrast to group life insurance rates, which are lower for females than for males, disability income rates are higher for females. Ignoring pregnancy-related disabilities, the claims of females at younger ages still somewhat exceed those of males. However, because male and female claims are comparable at older ages, the rates for later years seldom vary. The following table, which illustrates one insurance company's monthly manual rates per $10 of weekly benefit for 26 weeks following a 7-day waiting period, shows how this rate differential is even more pronounced at younger ages if maternity coverage is included.\n\nTable 15-8 Disability Income Rates\nAge\tMale\tFemale\nUnder 30\t$0.48\t$1.25\n30-34\t0.52\t1.25\n35-39\t0.56\t1.25\n40-44\t0.72\t1.21\n45-49\t0.81\t1.21\n50--54\t1.01\t1.31\n55-59\t1.21\t1.53\n60--64\t1.61\tl.61\n65-69\t2.01\t2.01\n70 and over\t2.16\t2.16\n\n\tIn the past, it was common for short-term disability income rates to be expressed on the basis of each $10 of weekly benefit. This is probably still the norm, but some insurance companies are now expressing their rates in terms of a higher weekly benefit, such as $50 or $100.\n\nLong-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\tLike short-term disability income rates, the manual rates for long-term coverage vary by age, gender, the length of the benefit period, the length of the waiting period, and possibly geographic location. In addition, the\nmanual rates reflect the fact that benefits are coordinated with Social Security and certain other disability income benefits for which an employee might be eligible. To the extent that insurers allow variations in the coordination provision that was assumed in developing the manual rates, they adjust the premium-calculation process. As is also the case with short-term rates, insurers might adjust for certain occupations.\n\tUnlike short-term disability income rates, which are commonly expressed on the basis of a weekly benefit, long-term rates are typically expressed on the basis of a monthly benefit, usually per $100. Unlike the coverages previously discussed, long-term disability claims fluctuate with general economic conditions. Consequently, insurance companies review and possibly revise their manual rates (and/or their underwriting standards) as economic conditions change.\n\tThe period for which insurers guarantee rates may vary from one to 3 years, depending on the industry in which the employees work.\n\nMedical Expense Insurance\n\tIn many ways, the manual rates for medical expense insurance (and also for dental insurance) are similar to those for disability income insurance because variations exist by age, gender, and the provisions of the plan, including the size of the deductible, the coinsurance percentage, and the level of benefits. Most providers of medical expense coverage have manual rates for the few standard plans that they sell, and only large employers have the flexibility to deviate from these plans. Adjustments to the manual rates reflect any such deviation. Insurers may also adjust manual rates if the employer is in an industry that has higher-than-average claims.\n\tOne other factor, geographic location, is always a variable in the manual rates because of the significant differences in medical costs across the country. Depending on group size, insurers may adjust for location in one of two ways. For large groups, the rating process usually starts with a manual rate that does not consider the location of employees. Each county (or other geographic subdivision) where coverage is written is then assigned a factor that is based on the cost of health care in that location compared with the \"average\" cost that is assumed in the manual rates. For example, if Seattle were 20 percent higher than average, it would have a factor of 1.2. If all of a firm's employees are there, the manual rates for that group is multiplied by a location factor of 1.2 in the process of determining the group's premium. If employees are in several locations, a composite factor is calculated as shown in the following table. Consequently, the manual rate for this group is increased by 5.5 percent because of the employees' locations.\n\nTable 15-9 Calculation of Location Factor\n\tNumber of\tLocation\nLocation\tEmployees\tFactor\tProduct\nSeattle\t100\tX\t1.2\t120\nKansas City\t70\tX\t1.0\t70\nBirmingham\t30\tX\t0.7\t21\n200\t211\n\nLocation Factor Total product ---= 211 =1055\n=----'----\t-\nTotal number of employees\t200\n\n\tInsurers use a slightly different approach for small groups. Because employees are usually in one location, many insurers have manual rate tables for between 10 and 20 rating territories, and they assign a specific territorial rating to each geographic area in which employees are located. The following territorial classifications are from the rating manual of one insurance company for some areas in four of the states where it writes business. The first three digits of the zip code identify these areas.\n\nGeorgia\n301-302, 311\t8\n303-304, 308-310, 312-319\t7\nall others\t6\nMichigan\n482\t10\n480,483\t8\n481\t6\n484-485,488-489\t3\nall others\t2\nTennessee\n370-372\t4\nall others\t3\nUtah\nentire state\t1\n\n\tThe next table, an excerpt from the manual rate tables of another company, shows how the monthly cost for coverage under one of its PPO plans varies by geographic area within a single state.\n\nTable 15-10 Medical Expense Rates\nEmployee's\nAge\t\nClass of Coverage\t\nArea 1\t\nArea 2\t\nArea 3\t\nArea 4\n30-39\tEmployee\t$248\t$305\t$335\t$ 459\n30-39\tEmployee and spouse\t404\t495\t551\t793\n30-39\tEmployee and children\t436\t535\t576\t791\n30-39\tFamily\t708\t856\t940\t1,331\n50-59\tEmployee\t448\t525\t523\t690\n50-59\tEmployee and spouse\t779\t915\t934\t1,228\n50-59\tEmployee and children\t606\t718\t743\t990\n50-59\tFamily\t968\t1,139\t1,205\t1,652\n\n\tThis excerpt lists manual rates for dependent coverage that the insurer applies regardless of the number of children or the ages of the dependents. For any size group, this is one of several possible methods for pricing dependent coverage. Another method uses rates that vary by the number of children. Some rating structures also take the ages of dependents into consideration.\n\tBecause medical expense claims are continually increasing as a result of inflation, a trend factor must be applied to past claims experience when manual rates are developed. This is often difficult for employers to\nunderstand. It is also a complex and often perplexing task for most providers of medical expense coverage. Not only has the overall cost of medical care increased faster than the general cost of living (as measured by the consumer price index), but the increases have been erratic from year to year and are virtually impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy. To complicate matters further, these increases vary significantly for each category of medical expenses; therefore, insurers must apply different trend factors to different categories of claims.\n\tAt one time, insurers guaranteed group insurance premium rates for at least 12 months and possibly for as long as 2 or 3 years. However, to protect themselves against unexpected increases in claims because of increases in the cost of medical care, some insurance companies now guarantee medical expense rates for no more than 6 months. In fact, a number of multiple-employer trusts have only 3-month guarantees, or they contain provisions whereby rates can be increased at any time, provided the insurer gives notice of the rate increase 30 or 60 days in advance. Some companies allow an employer to select the length of the rate guarantee, such as 6 months or one year. However, the longer the rate guarantee, the higher the rate.\n\nDental Insurance\n\tAlthough the rating of dental insurance is similar in many ways to the rating of medical expense insurance, there are some significant differences. Most insurance companies do not vary their manual rates by the ages of group members. Instead, an adjustment is often made for the income levels of employees, because higher-paid persons are much more likely to obtain dental care. This adjustment is usually in the form of a percentage based on the extent to which the portion of employees with incomes higher than some figure (such as $30,000) exceeds the proportion of such employees that is assumed in the manual rates. There is also an adjustment for certain occupations (such as salespeople or teachers) that use dental services more frequently than average. Finally, insurers usually increase the manual rates when a plan is new (or expands benefits) if the employees have been informed of the change beforehand. Under these circumstances, there is a tendency to postpone needed dental care until the new plan is in effect.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -   Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Claims\n\nCLAIMS\n     The handling of medical expense claims is different, depending on whether a plan provides benefits on an indemnity basis or on a service basis.\n\n      Subrogation provisions may also apply.\n\nIndemnity Benefits\n       Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on an indemnity basis typically require that the insurance company (or other provider) receive a written proof of loss (that is, a claim form) concerning the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which a covered person makes a claim. This form usually contains portions that must be completed and signed by the employee, a representative of the employer, and the provider of medical services.\n\n      The period during which an employee must file a claim depends on the provider of coverage and any applicable state requirements. An employee generally has at least 90 days (or as soon as is reasonably possible) after medical expenses are incurred to file. Some insurance companies require notification within a shorter time (such as 20 days) about any illness or injury on which a claim may be based, even though they give a longer time for the actual filing of the form itself.\n\n       Individuals have the right to assign their benefits to the providers of medical services. A covered person generally makes such an assignment, which authorizes the insurance company to make the benefit payment directly to the provider by completing the appropriate portion of the claim form. In addition, the insurance company has the right (as it does in disability income insurance) to examine any person for whom a claim is filed at its own expense and with the physician of its own choice.\n\nService Benefits\n      Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on a service basis (such as HMOs and the Blues) generally do not require that covered persons file claim forms. Rather, the providers of health care services perform any necessary paperwork and receive reimbursement directly.\n\n      For example, when a physician presents a claim, the plan must determine one or more of the following: the physician's status as a network participant; the primary or specialty care nature of the service if rendered by a network participant; and the applicability of an authorization requirement. Depending upon the plan's stringency, the provider's reimbursement may be denied altogether or be far less than the amount charged if the member receives services from a nonnetwork provider or sees a specialist without a required referral. In turn, the payment made to the provider determines whether the enrollee must pay a modest copayment, a more substantial amount under an indemnity benefit as described above, or the total amount if there is a claim denial.\n\n      Network providers with capitation payment arrangements file patient encounter forms that in effect are claims that produce no payment for a specific service.\n\nSubrogation\n       Most self-funded plans contain subrogation provisions. If state law allows, they are also commonly contained in the group medical expense contracts of HMOs, PPOs, the Blues, and insurance companies. A subrogation provision gives the plan (or the organization providing plan benefits) the right to recover from a third party who is responsible through negligence or other wrongdoing for a covered person's injuries that result in a claim payment. If a covered person receives a settlement from the third party (or their liability insurance company) for medical expenses that the plan has already paid, the covered person must reimburse the plan. The plan also has the right to seek a recovery from the party at fault for benefits paid if the person who receives benefits does not take legal action.\n"

Even an employee who assigns benefits to the provider may still be responsible for filing a claim form (i.e., to give the administrator a record of claims incurred).\n   The adjudication and payment of health and other welfare benefit claims may be handled by an employer that self-administers the plan or by a third party, such as a commercial insurance company or a third-party administrator. Employers may contract for administrative services separately from purchasing insurance and may also include actuarial and marketing services as part of the administrative contract. Few employers undertake paying claims themselves, and most fully insured plans\n(see KB-1 Topic 460) delegate claim processing to the insurer.\n   HMOs and PPOs. HMOs do not require patients to fill out forms to claim benefits because all benefits are prepaid by the monthly premium cost. In addition, some PPOs require providers to submit claims directly to the claim processor. For example, an employee might be billed a small copayment at the time of an office visit and not be required to file a benefit claim. This occurs because the provider agreed to accept as full payment the reimbursement from the sponsor of the PPO.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -   Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Claims\n\nCLAIMS\n     The handling of medical expense claims is different, depending on whether a plan provides benefits on an indemnity basis or on a service basis.\n\n      Subrogation provisions may also apply.\n\nIndemnity Benefits\n       Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on an indemnity basis typically require that the insurance company (or other provider) receive a written proof of loss (that is, a claim form) concerning the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which a covered person makes a claim. This form usually contains portions that must be completed and signed by the employee, a representative of the employer, and the provider of medical services.\n\n      The period during which an employee must file a claim depends on the provider of coverage and any applicable state requirements. An employee generally has at least 90 days (or as soon as is reasonably possible) after medical expenses are incurred to file. Some insurance companies require notification within a shorter time (such as 20 days) about any illness or injury on which a claim may be based, even though they give a longer time for the actual filing of the form itself.\n\n       Individuals have the right to assign their benefits to the providers of medical services. A covered person generally makes such an assignment, which authorizes the insurance company to make the benefit payment directly to the provider by completing the appropriate portion of the claim form. In addition, the insurance company has the right (as it does in disability income insurance) to examine any person for whom a claim is filed at its own expense and with the physician of its own choice.\n\nService Benefits\n      Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on a service basis (such as HMOs and the Blues) generally do not require that covered persons file claim forms. Rather, the providers of health care services perform any necessary paperwork and receive reimbursement directly.\n\n      For example, when a physician presents a claim, the plan must determine one or more of the following: the physician's status as a network participant; the primary or specialty care nature of the service if rendered by a network participant; and the applicability of an authorization requirement. Depending upon the plan's stringency, the provider's reimbursement may be denied altogether or be far less than the amount charged if the member receives services from a nonnetwork provider or sees a specialist without a required referral. In turn, the payment made to the provider determines whether the enrollee must pay a modest copayment, a more substantial amount under an indemnity benefit as described above, or the total amount if there is a claim denial.\n\n      Network providers with capitation payment arrangements file patient encounter forms that in effect are claims that produce no payment for a specific service.\n\nSubrogation\n       Most self-funded plans contain subrogation provisions. If state law allows, they are also commonly contained in the group medical expense contracts of HMOs, PPOs, the Blues, and insurance companies. A subrogation provision gives the plan (or the organization providing plan benefits) the right to recover from a third party who is responsible through negligence or other wrongdoing for a covered person's injuries that result in a claim payment. If a covered person receives a settlement from the third party (or their liability insurance company) for medical expenses that the plan has already paid, the covered person must reimburse the plan. The plan also has the right to seek a recovery from the party at fault for benefits paid if the person who receives benefits does not take legal action.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1430 - Continuation Coverage - COBRA - Qualified Beneficiaries-People Eligible for COBRA Coverage\n\n\tCOBRA coverage is available only for qualified beneficiaries. For COBRA purposes, a qualified beneficiary is generally anyone who is covered under a group health plan on the day before a qualifying event, including the spouse and dependent children of a covered employee.(Reference 1 below)\n\tCovered employees. \"Covered employee\" also includes self-employed persons, agents and independent contractors, and corporate directors. A person who is merely eligible for coverage under a group health plan but has not actually been covered is not a covered employee. Other classes of employees are covered employees under COBRA by virtue of the qualifying event that gives rise to their coverage-such as laid-off or striking employees or Medicare-eligible employees.\n\tNewborn or adopted children. Children born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee on or after the date of a qualifying event are considered qualified beneficiaries. (Reference 2 below)\n\tIf a covered employee who is also a qualified beneficiary does not elect COBRA coverage during the election period, then any child born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee on or after the date of the qualifying event is not considered a qualified beneficiary.(Reference 3 below)\n\tA child is \"placed for adoption\" for this purpose when a covered employee assumes and retains a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in anticipation of the child's adoption.(Reference 4 below)\n\tPart-time employees. Part-time employees are eligible for COBRA coverage if they were covered by the group health care plan and lose coverage due to a qualifying event If part-time employees' families are covered by the group health care plan and lose coverage due to a qualifying event, they may also be eligible for COBRA coverage.\n\tNonresident aliens. The term \"qualified beneficiary\" does not include an individual whose status as a covered employee is attributable to a period when he or she was a nonresident alien who received no earned U.S. source income from an employer. If the individual is not a qualified beneficiary as a result of this nonresident alien rule, the nonresident alien's spouse or dependent child is also not considered to be a qualified beneficiary. (Reference 5 below)\n\nOpen enrollment period\n\n\tIf an employer makes an open enrollment period available to non-COBRA beneficiaries, the same open enrollment period rights must be available to each COBRA qualified beneficiary.(Reference 6 below) An open enrollment period is a period during which an employee covered under a plan can choose to add or eliminate coverage of family members or can choose to be covered under another group health plan.\n\tIn addition to open enrollment periods, if the plan provides that new family members of active employees may become covered prior to the next open enrollment period, then the same right must be extended to a new family member of a COBRA beneficiary who joins the qualified beneficiary's family on or after the date of the qualifying event.(Reference 7 below)\n\nSame-sex marriage\n\tCOBRA benefits must be extended to the same-sex spouse of a covered employee, if the individuals are lawfully married under state law. For this purpose, a marriage is recognized as lawful if it took place in a state whose laws authorize same-sex marriage, even if the married couple lives in a state that does not recognize the validity of same-sex marriage.(Reference 8 below)\n\tTreatment of domestic partners. Health benefits offered to \"domestic partners\" after the breakup of a domestic partnership are not covered by COBRA However, employers may choose to offer continuation coverage to domestic partners of employees. Domestic partners are typically unrelated cohabiting adults, either heterosexual or homosexual. Note that for federal tax purposes, including COBRA coverage, the term \"marriage'' does not include a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar formal relationship recognized under state law that is not called a marriage under the laws of that state.\n\tSimilarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries\n\t\tCOBRA provides that the type of coverage offered to qualified beneficiaries must be the type available to similarly situated beneficiaries with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred.(Reference 9 below)\n\t\t\"Similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries\" refers to the group of covered employees and their spouses or dependent children who:\n\t\t\t1. are receiving coverage under an employer or employee organization group health plan for a reason other than the right to coverage under the requirements of COBRA; and\n\t\t\t2. based on all of the facts and circumstances, are most similarly situated to the situation of the qualified beneficiary immediately before the qualifying event.(Reference 10 below)\n\nPersons wrongfully denied coverage\n\tA person who is wrongfully denied group health plan coverage in violation of an applicable law is to be treated as a qualified beneficiary.(Reference 11 below)\n\tSpecifically, if a person is denied or not offered group health plan coverage in violation of another law1 for purposes of COBRA, that person is considered to have had the coverage that was wrongfully denied or not offered and thus is considered to be a qualified beneficiary.\n \nREFERENCES \n\n1 Code Sec. 4980B(g) (1) (A) and (B).\n2 Code Sec. 4980(B) (g) (1) (A) and ERISA Sec.607(3), as amended by P.L. 104-191.\n3 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-3, Q/A\u00b7l(t).\n4 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-3, Q/A-l(g).\n5 Code Sec. 4980B(g) (1) (C).\n6 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-4(c).\n7 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-5(b) and (c).\n8 Rev.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1455 - Continuation Coverage-COBRA - Coverage Requirements\n\n\tCoverage made available to qualifying employees and beneficiaries under the continuation coverage rules must be identical to the coverage that the plan provides to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries.(Reference 1 below)\n\nDeductibles\n\tA qualified beneficiary who has elected COBRA continuation coverage is generally subject to the same deductible as a similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiary who is still receiving regular plan coverage. For the purpose of meeting the deductible, a qualified beneficiary must be given credit for expenses incurred during the plan year, but before beginning COBRA continuation coverage, as if the qualifying event had never occurred.(Reference 2 below)\n\tIndividual deductibles. Generally, if a deductible is figured separately for each individual receiving coverage under the plan, each individual carries forward any amounts incurred prior to the date COBRA coverage commenced.(Reference 3 below) The deductibles are carried forward for the qualified beneficiary for the remainder of the plan year. For example, if the deductible for the plan is $500 and the employee had expenses of $100 to satisfy the deductible prior to a qualifying event, then the employee would only have to pay $400 of the deductible before other plan reimbursements would be available.\n\tFamily deductibles. When computing a family deductible, only the expenses of those family members electing COBRA coverage need be taken into account.(Reference 4 below) In addition, any family deductible may be computed separately for each resulting family unit based on the members in each unit.(Reference 5 below)\n\tCompensation and deductibles. If the deductible is based on the employee's annual compensation (for example, one percent of $30,000, or $300) instead of being a fixed dollar amount, employers have two options. First, the plan can treat the compensation level as being frozen for the duration of the COBRA continuation coverage period at the level used to compute the deductible immediately before the COBRA coverage began.\nUnder the second option, employers may calculate the deductible by taking the employee's actual compensation into account if the employee remains employed with the employer during the period of COBRA coverage. However, if the employee does not remain employed with the employer, then the level of compensation that must be taken into account must be either the compensation earned immediately before COBRA coverage began or the compensation in effect immediately before the employee is terminated.(Reference 6 below)\n\nLimits\n\tPlan limits on benefits are treated in the same way as deductibles. That is, out\u00ad of-pocket limits, annual maximum benefit payments, and other permissible plan limits are accounted for on a plan year basis. Therefore, expenses and events occurring before and after a qualifying event, but during one plan year, are treated the same for a COBRA beneficiary as they would be for an active plan participant. (Reference 7 below)\n\tWhen divorce is the qualifying event, an employer is required to take into account only those expenses incurred by the family members electing COBRA coverage. (Reference 8 below)\n\t\nChanging coverage\n\tThe group health plan must offer the qualified beneficiary coverage identical to that offered to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries. In situations where benefits are changed or eliminated for non-COBRA beneficiaries, qualified beneficiaries have the same rights (and not greater) as similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries.(Reference 9 below)The same principle also applies for determining whether a credit for deductibles must be carried over from an eliminated plan to a new plan. (Reference 10 below)\n\tOf course, if an employer providing more than one plan eliminates benefits under one plan without giving similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries the right to enroll in another plan, qualified beneficiaries must nonetheless be offered the right to receive coverage under another plan because of the employer's general obligation to continue to make COBRA continuation coverage available. (Reference 11 below)\n\tThe employer is required to offer only the coverage available to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries, even if that coverage is of no value to the COBRA qualified beneficiary. For example, if an employee with HMO coverage before the qualifying event is relocating and the HMO is not available in his new location, the continuation of HMO coverage would be of no value. The employer is not required to offer the employee alternate coverage unless the employer would offer alternate coverage to an active employee who was making a similar transfer. (Reference 12 below)\n\tAlternative coverage must be made available if the employer would be able to provide coverage to the beneficiary under one of its existing plans. However, if the qualified beneficiary participates in a region-specific benefit plan that will not be available where the qualified beneficiary is going, he or she must be given an opportunity to elect alternative coverage that the employer offers to active employees.(Reference 13 below)\n\tAn open enrollment period available to non-COBRA beneficiaries should also be available to qualified beneficiaries electing continuation coverage.(Reference 14 below) In addition, special enrollment rights also must be extended to new family members of qualified beneficiaries if the plan extends them to new family members of active employees; if the plan allows new family members to become covered (for example, newborn or newly adopted children or new spouses), the plan must allow the same for qualified beneficiaries; however, the new family members are not qualified benefi\u00ad ciaries unless another qualifying event occurs.(Reference 15 below)\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Code Sec. 4980B(f)(2)(A); IRS Reg. \u00a754.4980B-5, Q/A-l(a).\n2 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-2.\n3 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-2(b).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-2(c).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-2 (c).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-2 (e).\n7 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-3(a).\n8 Preamble to IRS Final Regulations; 64 FR 5160, February 3,1999\n9 Preamble to IRS Final Regulations; 64 FR 5160, February 3,1999.\n10 Preamble to IRS FinalRegulations; 64 FR 5160, February 3,1999.\n11 Preamble to IRS FinalRegulations; 64 FR 5160, February 3,1999.\n12 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-4(b).\n13 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-4(b).\n14 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-4(c).\n15 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-5.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

(Reference 1 below) Insurers also are required to \"prominently\" post information regarding premium increases on their websites.\n   \tHHS, again in conjunction with the states, is required to monitor premium increases of health insurance coverage offered both inside and outside the Ameri\u00ad can Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) (see KB-1 Topic 860). (Reference 2 below)\n   \tIn determining whether to exercise its option to permit large employers to participate in the Exchange, a state must consider any excess of premium growth outside the Exchange as compared to the rate of such growth inside the Exchange.\n   \tRate review process. A new rate process in HHS regulations requires health insurers to submit to the HHS and the applicable state a justification for an \"unreasonable\" premium increase prior to the implementation of the increase. (Reference 3 below)\n   \tReasonable increase does not exceed 15 percent. HHS concludes that premium rate increases under 15 percent are reasonable. Thus, for rate increases filed for policy or plan years beginning in 2019, in a state that does not require rate increases to be filed, the threshold for whether rates are subject to review would be whether the average weighted increase in the rate filing, alone or in combination with prior increases in the preceding 12 month period, is 15 percent or more. (Reference 4 below) The default threshold for rate increases subject to review was 10 percent prior to 2019.\n   \tDisclosure notices. Related to the rate increase regulations are proposed consumer disclosure notices, which include an easy-to-understand breakdown of an insurer's proposed rate increase-helping make sure that, as the rate increase is being reviewed, consumers who would be affected by the increase have access to information about their insurance rates. The notices provide basic information about health insurance rate increases and their review, as well as detailed information about the specific increase that an insurer has proposed. Consumers also will be able to see what the insurance company believes is driving the increase in premiums and how much of the increase would go to medical services, profits, and administrative expenses.\n\tThe proposed notices require health insurers to advise consumers of the insurer's products affected by the rate increase, the average dollar increase and monthly rate that would result from the proposed rate adjustment, range of percentage increase depending on individual factors, when the new rate would be effective, and how many people in the state would be affected.

                    "text": "KB-5 - Introduction to Medical Expense Benefits - Cost Containment\n\n\tBetween 1970 and today, the average annual increases in the cost of medical care were approximately twice the average annual increases in the consumer price index. No single factor accounts for these increases. Rather, it was a combination of the following reasons:\n\u2022 technological advances. Many exciting technological advances took place. Such techniques as CAT scans, MRIs, fetal monitoring, and organ transplants are now saving numerous lives. As miraculous as many of these techniques are, they are also very expensive. Technological advances can also prolong the life of the terminally ill and increase associated medical expenses.\n\u2022 increasing malpractice suits. The providers of care were much more likely to be sued than in the past, and malpractice awards outpaced the general rate of inflation. This development resulted in higher malpractice insurance premiums, a cost that is ultimately passed on to consumers. The increase in malpractice suits also led to an increase in defensive medicine, with routine tests likely to be performed more often.\n\u2022 design of medical expense plans. Many medical expense plans provided first-dollar coverage or had low out-of-pocket costs for many health care services. There was often little incentive for patients to avoid the most expensive forms of treatment.\n\u2022 increases in mandates by the states that require insurance contracts to provide coverage for certain types of medical care and for treatment by certain types of providers. In some cases, these mandates transfer costs that persons were already paying to insurance companies. However, they also increase the overall utilization of certain types of care, which results in increased costs.\n\u2022 increases in third-party payments. Private health insurers or the government paid a growing portion of the country's health care expenditures. The expansion of coverage and benefits shielded providers and patients from the true cost of health care.\n\u2022 underutilization of medical facilities. The United States had an overabundance of hospital beds, which are expensive to maintain. This situation still exists. A surplus of physicians also began to develop, particularly specialists. An oversupply of physicians tends to drive up the average costs of medical procedures so that physicians' average income does not decrease. Also, more recently, a shortage of primary care physicians is developing. This forces persons to obtain more expensive care with specialists and in emergency rooms.\n\u2022 AIDS. The increase in the number of AIDS cases resulted in increasing costs to employers. Costs in excess of $100,000 for an employee with AIDS are not unusual.\n\u2022 an aging population. The incidence of illness increases with age. Current demographics indicate that this trend will be a source of cost increases for several years to come.\n\tDuring the period from 1994 to 1996, several factors caused the cost of medical expense coverage to remain uncharacteristically stable, particularly for managed care plans. Many providers of medical services and medical expense plans were reluctant to raise costs while the health care proposal of the Clinton administration was being debated. In addition, managed care plans were holding down premiums while actively increasing enrollments.\n\tHowever, the late 1990s started to see significant increases in health care costs, particularly because of skyrocketing costs for prescription drugs. There is a feeling among benefit consultants that managed care plans have saturated the market to the point that savings resulting from additional employees moving to managed care plans will be modest. There is also an interesting trend occurring among medical providers. The large number of mergers of hospitals and other providers of medical services in many parts of the country may in fact shift the balance of bargaining power to these providers from managed care plans and other buyers of medical services. In addition, costs will increase somewhat because of federal and state legislation that continues to mandate benefits.\n\tIncreasing health care costs have become the concern of almost everyone-government, labor, employers, and consumers. Measures employers use include:\n\u2022 benefit plan design\n\u2022 alternative providers\n\u2022 alternative funding methods\n\u2022 claims review\n\u2022 health education and preventive care\n\u2022 encouragement of external cost-control systems\n\u2022 managed care\n\u2022 consumer-directed plans\n\nBenefit Plan Design\n\tNumerous design features of a medical expense plan can control costs. These have traditionally been in the form of contractual provisions that shift costs to employees. Examples are\n\u2022 deductibles\n\u2022 coinsurance\n\u2022 copayments\n\u2022 exclusions and limitations\n\u2022 maximum benefits\n\tIn recent years, many design features have been aimed at reducing costs rather than shifting them. In fact, benefit plans are often structured to provide a higher level of benefits if less costly alternatives are used. Examples of these cost-containment features are\n\u2022 preadmission testing\n\u2022 second surgical opinions\n\u2022 coordination of benefits\n\u2022 the use of alternatives to hospitals (such as skilled-nursing facilities, home health care, hospice care, birthing centers, and ambulatory care centers). In addition, there is increasing use by large employers of on-site health centers. Their presence decreases employee use of more expensive emergency rooms and urgent care centers. The also may be a convenient source of preventive care, such as flu shots, and for monitoring chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma.\n\u2022 the use of health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, and other consumer-directed medical expense plans. These plans typically involve the use of high-deductible medical expense policies.\n\nAlternative Providers\n\tThe use of HMOs and PPOs has been popular for some years as a cost-containment method. These methods have now been joined by point-of-service plans, usually designed as variations of HMOs.\n\nAlternative Funding Methods\n\tEmployers are increasingly turning to funding methods that are alternatives to the traditional insurance company plan or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan.\n\nClaims Review\n\tThere is no doubt that claims review can generate substantial cost savings. In general, the employer does not do this review. Rather, the provider of medical expense benefits, a third-party administrator, or some independent outside organization performs this function. At a minimum, claims should be reviewed for patient eligibility, eligibility of the services provided, duplicate policies, and charges that are in excess of usual, customary, and reasonable amounts. Many medical expense plans routinely audit hospital bills, particularly those that exceed some stipulated amount, such as $5,000 or $10,000. They check for errors in such items as length of stay, services performed, and billed charges. Many insurance companies have found that each dollar spent on this type of review results in two or three dollars of savings.\n\tGood claims review should also look at ongoing claims. For example, is hospice care or home health care a less expensive alternative to hospitalization? Many providers of medical expense benefits pay for such alternative forms of treatment even if the medical expense plan does not cover them as long as their cost is lower than the cost of continued hospitalization.\n\nHealth Education and Preventive Care\n\tPersons who lead healthy lifestyles tend to have fewer medical bills, particularly at younger ages. Healthier employees save an employer money by taking fewer sick days and having fewer disability claims. For these reasons, employers are increasingly establishing wellness programs and employee-assistance plans. With increasing health awareness among the general population, the existence of these programs also has a positive side effect-the improvement of employee morale.\n\tUse of health coaches and advocates is also increasing. These medical professionals-often registered nurses-provide employees with individualized advice about treatment and suggest questions to ask providers of care. In some cases, a covered person contacts a health coach for advice. In other cases, the coaches take a more proactive approach and contact persons who have had specific types of claims. For example, a coach may contact a diabetic every few months to make sure he or she is following up on the treatment and medical tests to prevent more severe medical problems.\n\tIn addition, more employers are paying for certain types of preventive care in full, particularly when the cost of such care is shown to be more than offset by a reduction in future medical expenses. Since a main objective of the Affordable Care Act is preventive care these benefits are mandated as essential health benefits and not only must be covered, but covered with no patient cost-sharing.\n\nEncouragement of External Cost-Control Systems\n\tAlthough a certain degree of cost containment is within the control of employers, the proper control of costs is an ongoing process that requires participation by consumers (both employers and individuals), government, and the providers of health care services. Many agencies and committees of the Department of Health and Human Services carry out these activities at the federal level. This government department has the primary responsibility for identifying health care needs, monitoring resources, establishing priorities, recommending courses of action, and overseeing laws that pertain to health care.\n\tAt the state and local level, many employers are active in coalitions whose purpose is to control costs and improve the quality of health care. These groups- which may also involve unions, providers of health care, insurance companies, and regulators- are often catalysts for legislation, such as laws authorizing PPOs and establishing hospital budget-review programs. Some coalitions act as purchasing groups to negotiate lower-cost coverage for members. For example, one coalition consists of several large corporations and offers a uniform health plan to the employees of its members. The plan is self-funded by the coalition and utilizes the services of several thousand primary care physicians and specialists. Another coalition, an example of a different approach, represents many small employers. The coalition negotiates with providers of medical expense coverage and offers its members a choice of several different group plans. Still other coalitions negotiate prescription drug benefits, employee assistance plans, vision benefits, and dental benefits for member employers.\n\nManaged Care\n\tFor many years, the buzzword with respect to cost containment has been managed care. In a general sense, the term includes any medical expense plan that attempts to contain costs by controlling the behavior of participants. However, in practice many persons use the term to mean different things. At one extreme are traditional plans that require second opinions and/or hospital precertification. At the other extreme are HMOs and PPOs that limit a participant's choice of medical providers, negotiate provider fees, and manage utilization of medical services.\n\tManaged care plans have evolved over the last few years. Today, it is generally felt that a true managed care plan should have five basic characteristics:\n\u2022 controlled access to providers. It is difficult to control costs if participants have unrestricted access to physicians and hospitals. Managed care plans attempt to encourage or force participants to use specified providers. Because a major portion of medical expenses results from referrals to specialists, managed care plans tend to use primary care physicians as gatekeepers to determine the necessity and appropriateness of specialty care. By limiting the number of providers, managed care plans are better able to control costs by negotiating provider fees.\n\u2022 comprehensive utilization management. Successful managed care plans perform utilization review at all levels. This involves reviewing a case to determine the type of treatment necessary, monitoring ongoing care, and reviewing the appropriateness and success of treatment after patients receive it.\n\u2022 preventive care. Managed care plans encourage preventive care and the attainment of healthier lifestyles.\n\u2022 risk sharing. Managed care plans are most successful if providers share in the financial consequences of medical decisions. Newer managed care plans have contractual guarantees to encourage cost-effective care. For example, a physician who minimizes diagnostic tests may receive a bonus. Ideally, such an arrangement will eliminate unnecessary tests, not discourage tests that providers should order.\n\u2022 high-quality care. A managed care plan is not well received nor often selected by participants if there is a perception of inferior or inconvenient medical care. In the past, too little attention was paid to this aspect of cost containment. Newer managed care plans not only select providers more carefully but also monitor the quality of care on a continuing basis.\n\tThere seems to be a reasonable consensus among employers and benefit specialists that there is a negative correlation between benefit costs and the degree of managed care-that is, the greater the degree of managed care, the lower the cost. For example, studies generally rank benefit plans in the following order (from highest to lowest) with respect to annual benefit costs:\n\u2022 traditional insurance company and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans without utilization management\n\u2022 traditional insurance company and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans with utilization management\n\u2022  PPOs\n\u2022 point-of-service plans\n\u2022 independent practice association HMOs closed-panel HMOs\n\tIt is interesting to note that the degree of managed care increases as one goes down the list. There also seems to be a high correlation between annual benefit costs and the rate of cost increases. For example, the cost of traditional benefit plans has been increasing recently at an annual rate in excess of the annual increase in cost for closed-panel HMOs.\n\nConsumer-Directed Health Care\n\tThe early part of this decade has seen considerable interest in the concept of consumer-directed health care. With this approach, employees are put in charge of managing the health care dollars their employers provide. It exposes employees to the true cost of care and involves them in keeping health care expenditures under control.\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 22 - Social Insurance Programs - Workers' Compensation - Recent Developments and Continuing Challenges\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND CONTINUING CHALLENGES\n\n\tThe workers' compensation program has experienced significant changes in recent decades, many of which were stimulated by developments between 1985 and 1991.(Reference 18 below) There was a rapid escalation in the employers' costs of workers' compensation, largely due to the increases in benefit payments discussed below. The costs increased from $25.1 billion in 1984 to $55.2 billion in 1991, or an average of 11.9 percent a year, which far outpaced payroll growth. As a result, workers' compensation costs as a percent of payroll increased rapidly, rising from 1.49 percent in 1984 to 2.16 percent in 1991.\n\n\tWorkers' compensation benefits also increased during the period, from $18.0 billion in 1984 to $40.8 billion in 1991, for an average annual increase of 12.4 percent. Benefits increased from 1.09 percent of payroll in 1984 to 1.35 percent in 1991. Medical benefits increased by 14.6 percent per year between 1995 and 1991, more rapidly than both the annual increase of 11.0 percent in cash benefits and the high inflation rate for general heath\u00adcare costs. The sources of the relatively high inflation in medical costs in the workers' compensation program included the rapid spread of managed care through the health care system used for nonoccupational medical conditions.\n\n\tThroughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, many employers became concerned about the increasing costs of workers' compensation. In addition to cost increases resulting from higher statutory cash benefits and escalating medical benefits, employers were also concerned about what they perceived to be widespread fraud and rampant litigation, especially involving conditions, such as workplace stress, that employers felt were outside the proper domain of the program.\n\n\tThe workers' compensation insurance industry was particularly agitated during this period. Several factors contributed to the industry's problems. Benefit payments accelerated during this period. Nonetheless, carriers were unable to gain approval from regulators for the significant premium increases the industry believed were actuarially justified. Even though investment income was relatively high from 1984 to 1991 (always exceeding 12 percent of premium), underwriting losses were so substantial that the overall operating ratio was 103.8 or higher in every year between 1984 and 1991 (Burton 2008a).(Reference 19 below) In other words, the workers' compensation insurance industry lost money in every year during this period, even after taking into account the returns on investments.\n\n\tThe major legacy of the period from 1985 to 1991 was the planting of the seeds for reform that bloomed in the 1990s and that have had lasting effects on the program. Over half of the state legislatures passed major amendments to workers' compensation laws between 1989 and 1996, generally with the purpose of reducing the cost of the program. Spieler and Burton (1998) identified five significant developments related to these efforts to reduce costs.\n\n\tFirst, the statutory level of cash benefits was reduced in a number of jurisdictions, particularly with regard to benefits paid for permanent disabilities. Second, eligibility for workers' compensation benefits was narrowed due to changes in compensability rules. These included requiring workers to provide objective medical evidence to support their claims, the tightening of procedural rules (such as placing the burden of proof on workers to establish their claims), and the restriction on eligibility when the extent of a worker's disability was due in part to a prior injury.\n\n\tThird, the health care delivery system in workers' compensation was transformed in many states, most notably by the introduction of managed care, by limitations on the worker's choice of the treating physician, and by the promulgation of fee schedules. The fourth development was the increasing use of disability management by employers and carriers, largely due to unilateral action by these parties, but also in part as a result of inducements provided by state legislation.\n\n\tFinally, in a development discussed later in more detail, the exclu\u00ad sive remedy doctrine, which precludes workers from bringing tort suits against their employers as a result of workplace injuries, was challenged in several court decisions. In addition to these five factors related to workers' compensation reform efforts, another factor that helps explain the decline in employee benefits and employer costs in the 1990s was the significant drop in the work-related injury rate in the decade (from 8.8 cases per 100 workers per year in the private sector in 1990 to 6.1 cases per 100 workers in 2000).\n\n\tAs a result of these various factors, workers compensation benefits increased modestly or even declined in the 1990s, depending on the measure used.(Reference 20 below) Benefits paid to workers increased from $42.2 billion in 1991 to $47.7 billion in 2000, which represented less than a 1.5 percent annual rate of increase. Benefits as a percent of payroll peaked at 1.65 percent of payroll in 1991-1992, and then declined to 1.06 of payroll in 2000. The multi-year decline in benefits relative to payroll is unprecedented in duration and magnitude since at least 1948, when the annual data for successive years were first published.\n\n\tLargely as a result of these benefit developments, the employers' costs of workers' compensation only increased from $55.2 billion in 1991 to $60.1 billion in 2000, which is less than 1.0 percent a year. Costs as a percent of payroll peaked at 2.18 percent of payroll in 1990 and then slid to 1.34 percent of payroll in 2000. As benefits and costs relative to payroll declined in the 1990s, the profitability of private carriers quickly improved. The overall operating ratio (which includes net investment income) fell from a peak of 108.7 in 1991 to a low of 81.8 in 1995, and was below 100 from 1993 to 2000. The four years from 1994 to 1997, when the operating ratio was below 90 in every year, represents the most profitable stretch of years in at least 20 years for workers' compensation insurance.\n\n\tIn the 21st century, benefits increased from $47.7 billion in 2000 (1.06 percent of payroll) to $56.1 billion in 2004 (1.13 percent of payroll) and then grew slightly to $57.6 billion in 2008, which was slower than the growth of payroll (0.97 percent of payroll). The employers' costs of workers' compensation increased from $60.1 billion in 2000 (1.34 percent of payroll) to $84.2 billion in 2004 (1.70 percent of payroll) and then declined to $78.9 billion in 2008 (1.33 percent of payroll). During the current decade, both benefits and costs as a percent of payroll remain well below their peaks of the 1990s. The workers' compensation insurance industry was unprofitable in 2001 and 2002, but achieved marginal profitability in 2003 (with an overall operating ratio of 98.1) and substantial profitability in 2004 to 2007 (with the operating ratio below 90 in 2006 and 2007).\n\nChanging Insurance Arrangements\n\n\tInsurance arrangements have been affected by changes in state insurance funds, by the deregulation of private insurance markets, and by changes in the residual market. These changes are discussed here.\n\nChanges in State Insurance Funds\n\n\tWorkers' compensation has relied on a mixture of state funds, private carriers, and self-insurance from its origins in most states between 1910 and 1920.(Reference 21 below) From the beginning, there were arguments concerning the merits of the various insurance arrangements. State funds were lauded because of lower overhead (notably the absence of a broker's fee) and because proponents thought that profits were inappropriate in a mandatory social insurance program. Private carriers were praised because they promoted efficiency and were considered more compatible with our capitalistic society. The arguments that prevailed varied from state to state: some jurisdictions created exclusive state funds; some authorized only private carriers to provide insurance; and some permitted private carriers to compete with state funds.\n\n\tThe initial choices of insurance arrangements by the states prevailed for an extended period. As of 1960, there were seven exclusive state funds, the youngest of which was the North Dakota fund established in 1919. There were also 11 competitive state funds as of 1960; the youngest was the Oklahoma fund established in 1933. Oregon converted its exclusive state fund into a competitive state fund in 1966; this represented the only change in state funds between the early 1930s and the early 1980s.\n\n\tOne of the significant developments in the workers' compensation insurance market in the mid-1980s through the 1990s was the emergence of several new competitive state funds. The \"pioneer\" of the modern movement was Minnesota, which established a competitive state fund in 1984. Then, in the 1990s, seven new competitive state funds began operation. However, in contrarian moves, the long-existing Michigan competitive state fund was privatized in 1994 and a 2009 law will convert the Arizona competitive state fund into a mutual insurance company by 2013. In addition, the Nevada exclusive state fund was privatized in 1999 and the West Virginia exclusive state fund was privatized in 2009.\n\n\tThe state legislators' motives for establishing the state funds were (l)to reduce the costs of workers' compensation and/or (2) to provide an alternative source of insurance for employers who could not purchase policies in the voluntary market or who did not like the surcharges or other conditions imposed on policies purchased in the residual or assigned-risk markets. And, likewise, part of the rationale for privatizing the Nevada and West Virginia state funds was to reduce the costs of workers' compensation insurance.\n\n\tThe cost-savings motives for these changes in insurance arrangements do not appear to be evidence-based. Thomason, Schmidle, and Burton (2001) found there were no differences in insurance costs between states with exclusive state funds and states with private carriers, after controlling for other factors that influence interstate differences in costs, such as injury rates and benefit levels. Among states with private carriers, they found that states with competitive state funds have insurance costs that are nearly 18 percent higher than the costs in states that only have private carriers.\n\nDeregulation of Private Insurance Markets\n\n\tAnother significant development in workers' compensation insurance arrangements in recent decades has been the deregulation of the markets in which private carriers operate. In contrast to the deregulation that generally occurred in property and casualty insurance in the 1970s, rate setting in workers' compensation insurance continued to be highly regulated until the 1980s. The deregulation of workers' compensation insurance was resisted on several grounds: the distinctive characteristic of workers' compensation as a mandated social insurance program (and the resultant concerns with both rates for employers and solvency for carriers); the existence of competitive measures other than price competition for workers' compensation insurance (primarily through dividends); and the need for a comprehensive data base (with uniform rate classes and information on the experience of a large number of insurers). These arguments helped delay even partial deregulation of workers' compensation insurance in most states until the 1980s and 1990s and still operate to preserve \"pure\" administered pricing in a few states and vestiges of regulation in most states.\n\n\tThe multiple steps that are involved in moving from a manual rate applicable to an employer to the premium paid by that employer are discussed in Appendix 22.1 in connection with Table A22.1-l. The essence of administered pricing is that all carriers were required to start with the same manual rates, and the various modifications to those rates involved either (l) formulas or constants to which all carriers had to adhere and which modified the manual rates at the beginning of the policy period, or (2) dividends that were paid only after the policy period ended. In short, there was virtually no chance for carriers to compete in terms of price at the beginning of the policy period.\n\n\tAdministered pricing is no longer the dominant approach to workers' compensation insurance pricing in the United States. A fundamental result of the deregulation of the workers' compensation insurance market that has taken place in the last 30 years is that private carriers can now compete for business by varying the insurance rates at the beginning of the policy period. Most jurisdictions now allow deviations and scheduled rating.(Reference 22 below) and a number of jurisdictions have moved to more comprehensive forms of deregulation, which generally fall under the rubric \"open competition\" or \"competitive rating.\" These reforms involve various combinations of three different changes to the regulatory environment. First, some states have dropped the requirement that insurers become members of the rating organization or adhere to bureau rates. Second, other jurisdictions no longer require insurers to obtain regulatory approval prior to using rates. Third, some states prohibit the rating organization from filing fully developed rates that include loading factors for administrative expenses and profits; instead, these organizations file loss costs or pure premiums. Each carrier has to decide what loading factor should be used in conjunction with pure premiums to produce the equivalent of manual rates.\n\n\tThe initial phase of deregulation began in the early 1980s, and nine states adopted competitive rating between 1981 and 1985. Several factors help explain the onset of deregulation. First, the overall political climate became more hostile to the notion that \"big government\" could do a better job than competitive forces in determining prices and allocating resources, and one consequence was a general move towards deregulation involving industries such as airlines and trucking, as well as the insurance industry. Another factor was a perception among some legislators, unions, and employers that profits in the workers' compensation insurance line were excessive. The hope was that deregulation would help reduce costs by squeezing out excess profits. Not surprisingly, most workers' compensation insurers resisted deregulation during this period.\n\n\tAfter the initial spurt of deregulation in the early 1980s, there was a slowdown in the introduction of deregulation in the balance of the 1980s, with only seven additional states enacting open competition statutes. However, one consequence of the unprofitability of workers' compensation insurance in the late 1980s and early 1990s was a change in attitude towards deregulation by many in the insurance industry.\n\n\tDeregulation was now seen as a way to escape from the \"onerous\" decisions of insurance regulators and to establish rates that would allow carrier profitability. Deregulation reemerged with vigor during the 1990s: open competition statutes became effective in 18 states between 1991 and 1995 and in an additional three states by the end of the decade. Deregulation in some of these states-especially those that adopted open competition in the early 1990s when the industry was still experiencing losses-reflected support from the insurance industry, while deregulation in other states, most notably California in 1995, where rate filings had generally been approved by the insurance commissioner, was generally resisted by the industry.\n\n\tThe effect of deregulation on the costs of workers' compensation insurance depends on several factors, such as the stringency of rate regulation in a state prior to deregulation and the particular form of deregulation. Thomason, Schmidle, and Burton (2001) found that comprehensive deregulation the use of loss costs (instead of manual rates) that were not subject to prior approval by the state before carriers could establish the rates they would charge-reduced the costs of workers' compensation insurance by about 11 percent below the rates that would have been charged if states had continued to rely on administered pricing. They also found that partial deregulation for example states that continued to rely on manual rates but allowed carriers to deviate from those rates-resulted in higher workers' compensation rates than would have been paid by employers under administered pricing.\n\n\tAnother consequence of deregulation is that, because deviations and schedule rating allow carriers to compete at the beginning of the policy period, dividends to policyholders paid after the policy period have declined in importance. In the early 1980s, dividends ranged from 8.0 to 10.6 percent of premiums, while between 2002 and 2007, dividends varied between 1.3 to 2.8 percent of premiums (Burton 2008a).\n\nChanges in the Residual Market\n\n\tAnother noteworthy development in workers' compensation insurance in recent decades was the rise and fall of the share of premiums accounted for by the residual market. The traditional reasons why an employer was unable to obtain workers' compensation insurance policies in the voluntary market were that the applicant was engaged in some activity that was unusually hazardous relative to the experience of other firms in the appropriate insurance classification, or had a poor loss record, or was so small that the premium did not adequately compensate the insurer for its expenses (Williams, 1969, p. 48). Prior to the mid-1980s, the residual market share generally accounted for five percent or less of all premiums nationally.(Reference 23 below)\n\n\tThe fiscal stress that the workers' compensation insurance market was under from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s is clearly evident in the explosion of the residual market share from 5.5 percent of all premiums in 1984 to a peak of 28.5 percent in 1992. In addition to the traditional reasons for the applicants being forced to purchase in the residual market, which were basically due to the unattractiveness of individual risks, the dominant factor contributing to the residual market growth in the 1985-1992 period was the general inadequacy of workers' compensation insurance rates because of the reluctance of insurance regulators in many states to approve rate filings with substantial rate increases for the voluntary market. Carriers in such jurisdictions became unwilling to write policies in the voluntary market because they could not make an adequate (or, in many cases, any) profit.\n\n\tThe share of workers' compensation insurance provided through the residual market was 80 percent or more in several states (Louisiana, Rhode Island, and Maine) in one or more years between 1989 and 1991. A vicious cycle ensued in some states:\n\n\t\t\u25a0 Rates were held down in the voluntary market by regulators.\n\t\t\u25a0 Carriers were unwilling to write policies in the voluntary market, which forced some employers into the residual market.\n\t\t\u25a0 In addition, regulators sometimes responded to political pressures and held insurance rates in the residual market well below the levels that were warranted, which induced some employers who were able to purchase policies in the voluntary market to obtain policies in the residual market because the rates were so low; the residual markets ran substantial deficits because of inadequate rates.\n\t\t\u25a0 The carriers in the voluntary market were assessed substantial sums to cover the assigned risk markets deficits.\n\t\t\u25a0 When the carriers tried to pass on these assessments to policyholders still in the voluntary market, many employers shifted to the residual market in order to obtain coverage at the suppressed rates, which only increased the size of the residual market and increased assessments in the voluntary market.\n\n\tThe national share of total premiums accounted for by the residual market rapidly declined after 1994 (to less than 5 percent by 1998) due to the three major factors already discussed. First, the overall profitability of the workers' compensation insurance line quickly improved after 1992, which made carriers more willing to provide policies in the voluntary market. Second, several jurisdictions established competitive state funds or other special public or quasi-public funds to provide insurance to employers who could not find policies in the voluntary market. The third factor was a series of changes in assigned risk policies that made these policies more expensive and reduced the subsidy from the voluntary market to the residual market, including the introduction of special experience-rating plans in the residual market that tied premiums more closely to each firm's own benefit payments.\n\n\tThe assessments on insurance policies in the voluntary market to underwrite losses in the residual market had two significant consequences for workers' compensation insurance.(Reference 24 below) Employers received an incentive to self-insure since such employers were usually not assessed to cover losses in the residual market. Benefits paid by self-insuring employers increased from 19.0 percent of all benefits in 1990 to 26.7 percent in 1995. Subsequently, as assessments for the residual market declined, the share of benefits provided by self-insuring employers declined (to 22.0 percent of all benefits in 2000).\n\n\tThe second effect of basing assessments for the residual market on insurance premiums was the rapid growth of policies with large deductibles. Under deductible policies written by private carriers or state funds, the insurer pays all of the workers' compensation benefits, but the employer is responsible for reimbursing the insurer for the benefits up to the specified deductible amount (such as the first $100,000 per injury). The amount reimbursed by the employer is not considered insurance for purposes of assessments for the residual market or other special funds in most states. The amount of benefits paid by employers under deductible provisions increased rapidly from $1.3 billion in 1992 to $8.0 billion in 2003, which represented 14.7 percent of the $54.7 billion total benefit payments in 2003. After 2003, the relative importance of large deductibles has slightly declined, with the $8.1 billion of deductibles in 2008 representing 14.1 percent of the $57.6 billion of total benefit payments. One consequence of the expanded use of deductibles should be added encouragement to work\u00adplace safety, since employers are essentially perfectly experience rated for the benefit payments up to the deductible.(Reference 25 below)\n\nThe Exclusive Remedy Principle\n\n\tSince their origins in the United States, workers' compensation programs have incorporated the workers' compensation principle, which has two elements: workers benefit from a no-fault system and employers benefit from limited liability, which means that workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy of employees against their employers for workplace injuries and diseases.(Reference 26 below) There have always been some exceptions to the exclusive remedy doctrine, however, and in recent decades there have been several developments that represent significant challenges to the doctrine.(Reference 27 below)\n\n\tOne traditional exception is that the employer is not protected from a tort suit when there is an intentional injury of the employee by the employer. There are at least five legal approaches that states can take when the employer engages in activity that at least arguably represents an intentional injury to the employee:\n\n\t\t1. First, some states do not recognize the intentional injury exception under any circumstances.\n\t\t2. Second, some states require a conscious and deliberate intent to inflict an injury. Larson and Larson (2010, Section 103.03) indicate that this exception to the exclusive remedy doctrine requires \"deliberate infliction of harm comparable to an intentional left jab to the chin.\"\n\t\t3. Third, some states allow an exception when the employer's conduct is \"substantially certain\" to cause injury or death.\n\t\t4. Fourth, the New Mexico Supreme Court created an exception to the exclusive remedy doctrine when the employer's conduct is willful.\n\t\t5. Fifth, no state (except perhaps New Mexico) upholds the intentional injury exceptions merely because the employer conduct is negligent, wanton, reckless, or even grossly negligent.\n\n\tThe third and fourth exceptions require explication. The exception when the employer's conduct is \"substantially certain\" to cause injury or death has been established by the courts in several states. In most of these states, including Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia, the exception was eliminated or narrowed by subsequent legislation. However, a series of recent New Jersey Supreme Court decisions, beginning with Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., 170 N.J. 602, 790 A.2d 884 (2002), endorsed the substantially certain test as one element of the intentional injury exception, and efforts by employers and carriers to eliminate the exception by statutory enactment have been unsuccessful. The New Mexico decision, Delgado v. Phelps Dodge Chino, Inc., 131 N.M. 272, 34 P. 3d 1148 (2001), includes as part of the definition of \"willful conduct\" that the employer's act is \"reasonably expected to result in the injury suffered by the employee,\" and to date that decision has not been overturned by the legislature. Whether the New Jersey-New Mexico axis of exception will spread to other jurisdictions is of concern to employers and insurers.\n\n\tAnother area in which the exclusive remedy provision is being challenged involves situations when an employee alleges sexual harassment at the workplace. The New Mexico Supreme Court held in Coates v. WalMart Stores, Inc., 976 P.2d 999 (1999) that a tort suit alleging negligent supervision and intentional infliction of emotional distress was not precluded by the exclusive remedy doctrine. However, courts interpreting the workers' compensation statutes in Delaware and Illinois have precluded tort claims for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress resulting from sexual conduct by fellow employees. Where tort suits for sexual harassment are precluded by the workers' compensation exclusivity principle, recovery against the employer may be possible under a state fair employment statute or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was amended in 1991 to permit compensatory or punitive damages for sexual harassment.\n\n\tA decision by the Supreme Court of Oregon, Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., 23 P.3d 333 (2001), provides another challenge to the exclusive remedy doctrine. The Oregon legislature passed legislation in 1993 denying workers' compensation benefits unless the worker could prove that work exposure was the major contributing cause of an occupational disease. In 1995, the Oregon legislature amended the workers' compensation statute to provide that workers' compensation was the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries and diseases, even if the condition was not compensable under workers' compensation because the work exposure was not the major contributing cause. In Smothers, the court said that the Oregon constitution did not allow the legislature to eliminate both the workers' compensation remedy and a tort remedy when the employment is not the major contributing cause of the condition. While this case established a clear limitation on the exclusive remedy provision in Oregon, similar constitutional challenges in other states have not been successful. Nonetheless, other challenges to statutes that remove any remedy for workplace injuries and disease may be successful under state statutes and constitutions, and arguably also under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Viability of Workers' Compensation\n\n\tThe workers' compensation system in the United States is experiencing stress along several dimensions. One is the conflict between affordability of the program for employers and adequacy of benefits for workers. Although economists argue that most of the costs of workers' compensation are paid for by workers in the form of lower wages,(Reference 28 below) employers nonetheless act as if they bear all of the costs and generally seek to reduce costs. The quest for affordability is encouraged in part to the decentralized nature of the programs, in which states compete for employers in part by offering low workers' compensation costs. The increased competition in the U.S. economy in recent decades as a result of deregulation of many domestic industries and of globalization has added to the pressures for states to reduce costs.\n\n\tThe pressures on states to reduce costs can have salutary effects to the extent that the result is increased efficiency in the delivery system for workers' compensation benefits, which, for example, might result from reduced litigation. However, the cost savings achieved by states in recent years often resulted from limiting eligibility for benefits or from maintaining or further curtailing benefits that were already inadequate. An example of the effects of restricting eligibility on workers is provided by Oregon, where Thomason and Burton (2001) estimate that a series of legislative provisions resulted in benefits (and costs) being about 25 percent below the amounts they would have been in the absence of the more restrictive eligibility standards. Guo and Burton (2010) examined the determinants of workers' compensation cash benefits in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and found that 21 percent of the drop in benefits during the 1990s could be explained by declines in the injury rates but that over 30 percent of the decline in benefits was due to changes in workers' compensation compensability rules and administrative practices.\n\n\tThe adequacy of the benefits provided to those workers who actually qualify for benefits has been examined in important recent studies. Hunt (2004) provides a comprehensive survey of the meaning of adequacy of benefits in the workers' compensation program. The generally accepted standard is that workers' compensation benefits should replace two-thirds of the wages lost because of the work injuries. However, Boden, Reville, and Biddle (2005) found that in the five jurisdictions they examined (California, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin) permanent partial disability benefits replaced between 16 and 26 percent of earnings losses in the ten years after the workers' were injured, which meant the \"replacement rates do not approach the two-thirds benchmark for adequacy.\"\n\n\tThe consequences of the tightening eligibility standards in workers' compensation may have another consequence that is troublesome for the future of the program. As the number of workers' compensation cases and costs of the program dropped in the 1990s, due in part to tighter eligibility standards for qualifying for benefits, the number of former workers quali\u00ad fying for Disability Insurance (DI) under the Social Security program increased. Some commentators, such as Sengupta, Reno, and Burton (2010, pp. 43-44) have raised the possibility that some disabled persons are being shifted from workers' compensation to the DI program. This perception is reinforced because, according to Burton and Spieler (2001), the changes in eligibility rules for workers' compensation benefits that took place in the 1990s had a particularly adverse effect on older workers, who are the predominant source of applicants for DI benefits. In preliminary results from an ongoing study, Guo and Burton (2008) found that states in which workers' compensation compensability rules were tightened and cash benefits were reduced there were increases in applications for DI benefits between 1985 and 1999.\n\n\tA final challenge to workers' compensation worth noting is the medical benefits provided by the program.(Reference 29 below) These benefits accounted for 50.4 percent of all benefit payments in 2008, up from 36.3 percent in 1987 (Sengupta, Reno, and Burton 2010, Table 4). Medical benefits in workers' compensation are also important because in many ways they are more generous than other medical benefits provided by employers.\n\n\tWith rare exceptions, medical care through workers' compensation is provided without deductibles, coinsurance, or premiums paid for by workers, while these attributes are lacking in health care benefits for nonoccupational conditions paid for by employers. Indeed, many employers do not provide any health care benefits for their workers-other than the medical care mandated for work-related injuries. This provides a glaring contrast between two health care systems for workers, and provides incentives for workers (and often providers and sometimes even employers) to shift conditions that are arguably work-related, such as back injuries, into workers' compensation.\n\n\tThe disparity between these two systems has led many employers who do provide nonoccupational health insurance to integrate the administration of all their programs for disabled workers, regardless of the origins of the disability. Some commentators have even suggested that the medical benefits (and perhaps the cash benefits) provided for work-related and nonwork-related disabilities should be combined into a 24-hour coverage program.(Reference 30 below)\n\n\tThe most controversial aspect of the medical benefits provided by workers' compensation that has emerged in recent years concerns the relationship between workers' compensation and Medicare, which is the federal program that provides medical benefits to individuals who are at least 65 years old or who have received Social Security Disability Insurance benefits for more than two years. Since the mid-1980s, the Medicare as Secondary Payer (MSP) Act has provided that if medical expenses could be covered by either workers' compensation or Medicare, then workers' compensation, and not Medicare, should pay for the benefits. Medicare is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which started to vigorously enforce the MSP Act in 2001 by requiring certain workers' compensation settlements to be preapproved before they can be paid. The MSP Act has been amended to further protect the federal interest in the Medicare program, including a requirement effective in 2009 increasing the reporting requirements under the act for employers and carriers.\n\n\tThis final section has identified some tensions and challenges for the workers' compensation program that may suggest the program may not survive far into the 21st century. It is thus worth remembering that the premier study of workers' compensation published over a half-century ago (Somers and Somers, 1954) concluded with a chapter entitled \"Workmen's Compensation at the Crossroads.\" The thrust of the chapter was that the problems of the program threatened its future unless fundamental changes were made. The program's name may have changed and the problems may be somewhat different than in 1954. But the experience of the intervening years suggests that the fundamental attributes of workers' compensation-a system confined to work-related injuries that provides limited benefits on a no-fault basis-are hard to successfully challenge and may be immutable.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n18. The discussion of developments in the 1980s and 1990s is largely based on Thomason, Schmidle, and Burton (2001, Chapter 2). The information on costs and benefits as a percent of payroll is from Burton (2010, Figure I).\n19. The combined ratio after dividends is the sum of losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses, and dividends. The overall operating ratio is the combined ratio after dividends minus net investment gain/loss and other income. The ratios are expressed as a percent of net premiums. Thus, an overall operating ratio of 103.8 means carriers were losing $3.80 for every $100 of net premiums, while an overall operating ratio of 80 means carriers were earning $20 of profit for every $100 of net premiums.\n20. The data on benefits and costs in the next three paragraphs are from Sengupta, Reno, and Burton (2010). The underwriting results are from Burton (2008a).\n21. The discussion of changes in insurance arrangements in this subsection is largely based on Thomason, Schmidle, and Burton (2001, pp. 32-47).\n22. If a state allows deviations, individual carriers may deviate from the published manual rates and charge lower (or higher) rates than those promulgated by the rating organization. The discounts offered by a carrier are uniform for all policyholders in an insurance classification (although the discounts may differ among classes). Under schedule rating plans, insurers can change (usually decrease) the workers' compensation insurance rates an individual employer would otherwise pay.\n23. Thomason, Schmidle, and Burton (2001, pp. 43-46) provide more details on the pre-1985 experience in the residual market, and note that in 1978-1979 the assigned risk market accounted for 12.7 percent of all premiums nationally as the cost of workers' compensation increased after 1975. However, the share dropped back to 5.5 percent in 1984, reflecting the generally profitable conditions in the workers' compensation insurance market and the declining costs of workers' compensation insurance.\n24. The data in the next two paragraphs are from Sengupta, Reno, and Burton (20IO).\n25. However, some states permit employers to purchase insurance for their benefit payments up to the deductible, which reduces the degree of experience rating for these benefits.\n26. The exclusive remedy provision means that the only recovery by the injured worker against his or her employer is workers' compensation benefits, unless the worker can take advantage of one of the exceptions to the exclusivity, such as the intentional injury exception discussed in this section. The injured worker may, however, be able to bring a tort suit against a third party who was at least partially responsible for the worker's injury. Examples of third parties that may be sued are manufacturers of defective machinery that was sold to the employer and producers of asbestos sold to firms whose workers contracted diseases because they were exposed to the substances. The suits against third parties and related issues are discussed in Willborn, Schwab, Burton, and Lester (2007, pp. 889-894).\n27. This subsection is largely based on Willborn, Schwab, Burton, and Lester (2007, pp. 868-889), Burton (2002), and Aurbach (2003).\n28. Leigh, Markowitz, Fahs, and Landrigan (2000, pp. 175-179) and Burton (2009, pp. 241-243) provide useful discussions of who pays for workers' compensation.\n30. Several variants of 24-hour coverage are examined by Burton (1997).\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 515 - Health Benefits - Health Plan Administration - Benefit Denial Procedures\n\n   There are many reasons why a claim might be denied. For example, the services may not be covered by the benefit plan. Another common reason for denial is that the treatment is experimental. The plan maximum benefit level may have been reached. The individual may not be eligible under the plan because he or she has not worked for the employer for the required number of days. Denial can also occur when the claimant has a preexisting condition that precludes coverage until a specified exclusion period has passed.\n   If a claim is denied. When a claim is denied, the plan administrator must provide the claimant with the reasons for denial in easy-to-understand language. The plan administrator must explain the information needed to perfect the claim, cite the plan provisions on which the denial was based, and detail the procedure for appealing the claim decision (Reference 1 below).\n   Ultimately, a participant may initiate a lawsuit to decide whether the plan should pay a claim. Depending on the amount of discretion accorded the administrator in interpreting a claim, the court could decide whether the denial of benefits constituted an abuse of discretion or review the facts de novo and make a decision on coverage (see KB-1 Topic 55).\n   For a detailed discussion of the benefit claims procedure, see KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nSupreme Court decisions\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that ERISA did not preempt an Illinois law allowing for an independent external review to resolve disputes over the \"medical necessity\" of medical treatments that a patient's primary care doctor has recommended (Reference 3 below). The end result of the Court's decision is that state independent review laws will control, as long as they don't create a new cause of action or provide a remedy beyond the benefits otherwise available under a plan.\n   The Supreme Court also has held that a Texas state law, the Texas Health Care Liability Act (fHCLA), was preempted by ERISA where two HMO participants sought recovery under the THCLA for their HMOs' refusal to provide certain treatment and services recommended by their doctors. The claims were only to rectify wrongful benefits denials; they did not arise independently of ERISA or the plans' terms. Because the claims were pure eligibility decisions, ERISA, not state law, provided the exclusive remedy (Reference 4 below).\n \nInterpretation of eligible expenses\n   In the process of paying or denying a claim, the administrator should differentiate expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from those that are not allowed under the plan. While many employers adopt many of the same plan provisions and follow state or federal laws that apply to the plans, each employer does have discretion in designing the welfare benefit plan that it offers to employees. Therefore, the claim payer must be able to identify each employer's plan and the specific provisions of the plan to identify eligible expenses.\n   Just because a charge is eligible for payment does not mean that the plan will reimburse for it. Charges that are not allowed should neither be reimbursed nor applied toward satisfaction of the deductible.\n   Pointer: The plan document should specify and define noncovered expenses so that the administrator, utilization reviewers, the employer, and participants can all clearly understand types of charges that the plan will not allow.\n   Payments that were wrongfully made by an administrator may be recovered under ERISA and claims fraudulently submitted may be denied payment.\n\nFor more information...\n   Claim procedure requirements under ERISA are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n   An ERISA-required review after a benefit denial is analyzed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n   Claim procedure requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are discussed at KB-1 Topic 934.\n\nFor more information ...\n   A discussion of possible reasons for denial of a medical claim is located at KB-1 Topic 10,425 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f) and (g).\n3 Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

(Reference 1 below)\n\nStandards of review\n\tIn reviewing a benefit denial under ERISA's civil enforcement standards, a court can consider the case anew from the beginning on its merits in what is called de novo review.\n\tHowever, where a plan gives the administrator or fiduciary the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan, a court needs only to determine whether the actions of the plan administrator were arbitrary and capricious.(Reference 2 below)\n\t\nSupreme Court rejection of deference exceptions. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that where a company's plan provisions gave the plan administrator the power to construe disputed terms, a federal district court should have deferred to the administrator's reasonable interpretation of disputed provisions.(Reference 3 below)\n\nArbitrary and capricious standard\nIn determining whether a fiduciary's actions were arbitrary and capricious, courts generally have considered whether\n\t1. the fiduciary acted rationally or reasonably;\n\t2. there was fraud or bad faith;\n\t3. there was a consistent application of the terms of the plan or ERISA; or\n\t4. the fiduciary's actions were based on substantial evidence.\n\nPointer: The provision of adequate notice prior to a fiduciary's exercise of discretionary authority might be considered relevant to a determination of arbitrariness.\nAn employee benefit plan that gave different reasons for denying benefits to a plan beneficiary at each stage of review failed to comply with requirements under ERISA.(Reference 4 below) The court found that the plan's denial had been arbitrary and capricious.\n\nReview of conflict-of-interest cases\n\tA plan administrator that both evaluates and pays benefits claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionai:y benefit determinations, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.(Refernce 5 below)\n\tThe conflict does not change the standard of review of a benefits denial from deferential to de novo, but the conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. \n\tA conflict of interest should prove more important where there is a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, such as where an insurance company administrator has a histoi:y of biased claims administration. \n\tThe conflict would prove less important, the court explained, where an administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\n\nFor more information ...\nThe standards of judicial review following a denial of benefits are discussed in greater detail at KB-1 Topic 130,090 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\nCivil enforcement under ERISA is discussed at KB-1 Topic 55.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1 Kinkead v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 45 - Basics of ERISA - Benefit Claims Procedures - Claims Procedures for Welfare Benefit Plans\n    Every welfare benefit plan must establish a claims procedure to process claims for benefits made by participants and beneficiaries. The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has issued regulations that provide new standards for processing claims under group health and group disability plans.\n    In July, 2010, the IRS, EBSA, and the HHS issued interim final regulations that added a number of requirements for internal claims procedures and appeals. The new rules implement the claims appeals requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111-148). These ACA changes are effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, though the Labor Department has provided for a grace period. Claims procedures under health reform are discussed at r 934\n    A plan that denies a claim for plan benefits must give the claimant adequate written notice of the denial. The claimant must also receive a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial (Reference 1 below).\n    The rules for filing a claim must be described in the summary plan description (SPD) (see r 110). A poorly written SPD that does not clearly specify a time limit for claims may excuse an employee from meeting the deadline (Reference 2 below).\n    The Eleventh Circuit has ruled that relevant medical records do not have to be supplied to a participant until after the decision to grant or deny a disability benefits claim has been made (Reference 3 below).\n\nNecessary information\n    A notice of a claim denial must state, in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the claimant, the following information:\n1. The specific reasons for the denial of the claim;\n2. A specific reference to the pertinent plan provision on which the denial is based;\n3. A description of any additional material or information that is necessary for a claimant to perfect the claim;\n4. An explanation of why the additional material or information needed to perfect the claim is necessary; and\n5. A description of the steps necessary (i.e., the appeals procedure) if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.\n    Pointer: If a participant brings a lawsuit claiming that an administrator's decision to deny benefits was made in bad faith, the fact that an administrator can show that these procedures were adhered to could help the administrator avoid liability for punitive damages (Reference 4 below).\n\nAdministrator as fiduciary\n    When a plan administrator denies a participant's claim for benefits, the administrator is acting as a fiduciary and so must meet the rules governing the conduct of fiduciaries.\n\nDisability benefit claims\n    At the initial level, disability claims must be resolved within 45 days of receipt. A plan may extend the decision-making period for an additional 30 days for reasons beyond the control of the plan. If, after this first extension, the plan administrator determines that it will still be unable, again for reasons beyond the control of the plan, to make a decision, the plan may extend decision-making for a second 30-day period.\n    During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan. Reviews of disability claim denials must be completed within 45 days of receipt of the claimant's request for review by the plan. Plans providing disability benefits may extend the decision\u00admaking time on review for an additional 45-day period if the plan administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim (Reference 5 below).\n    Final disability claims regs EBSA has issued final regulations that would enhance existing disability benefit claims procedures under ERISA Sec.503 (Reference 6 below). Note, however, that the Labor Department delayed the applicability date of these regulations until April 1, 2018, for ERISA plans to comply with a final rule amending the claims procedure requirements applicable to disability benefits. In issuing these regulations, EBSA hopes to apply to disability benefits many of the claims procedural protections and safeguards that have been applied to group health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The purpose of the regulation would improve the current procedural protections for workers who become disabled and make claims for disability benefits from an employee benefit plan.\n    \nThe regulations make the following major changes to the internal claims procedures for disability plans:\n claims and appeals must be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making the benefit determination;\n benefit denial notices must contain a complete discussion of why the plan denied the claim and the standards applied in reaching the decision, including the basis for disagreeing with the views of health care professionals, vocational professionals, or with disability benefit determinations by the Social Security Administration (SSA);\n claimants must be given timely notice of their right to access to their entire claim file and other relevant documents and be guaranteed the right to present evidence and testimony in support of their claim during the review process;\n claimants must be given notice and a fair opportunity to respond before denials at the appeals stage are based on new or additional evidence or rationales;\n plans cannot prohibit a claimant from seeking court review of a claim denial based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the plan if the plan failed to comply with the claims procedure requirements unless the violation was the result of a minor error;\n certain rescissions of coverage are to be treated as adverse benefit determinations triggering the plan's appeals procedures; and\n required notices and disclosures issued under the claims procedure regulation must be written in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.\n\n  Conflicts of interest. The final rule requires that decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or similar matters with respect to any individual must not be made based upon the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of disability benefits. For example, a plan cannot provide bonuses based on the number of denials made by a claims adjudicator. Similarly, a plan cannot contract with a medical expert based on the expert's reputation for outcomes in contested cases, rather than base on the expert's professional qualifications.\n  Right to appoint representative. The claims procedure of an ERISA-covered plan cannot \"preclude an authorized representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.\" In addition, prior department guidance on the claims procedure regulation confirms that authorized representatives are entitled to notifications in connection with initial claim determinations and appeals. Although a plan may establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant, the procedure cannot prevent claimants from choosing for themselves who will act as their representative or preclude them from designating an authorized representative for the initial claim, an appeal of an adverse benefit determination, or both. The plan must include any procedures for designating authorized representatives in the plan's claims procedures and in the plan's summary plan description (SPD) or a \nseparate document that accompanies the SPD. SPDs must satisfy the style and format requirements for SPDs in ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2520.102-2, and include a statement that the plan's claims procedures are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document (Reference 7 below).\n\n  Disclosure requirements. Under the final disability claims regulations, benefit denial notices must contain a more complete discussion of why the plan denied a claim and the standards used in making the decision. For example, the notices must include a discussion of the basis for disagreeing with a disability determination made by the SSA if presented by the claimant in support of his or her claim. Also, benefit denial notices must include a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, the entire claim file and other relevant documents.\n Benefit denial notices also have to include the internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the plan that were used in denying a claim or a statement that none were used. Currently, instead of including these internal rules and protocols, benefit denial notices have the option of including a statement that such rules and protocols were used in denying the claim and that a copy will be provided to the claimant upon request.\n\n  Deemed exhaustion. If plans do not adhere to all disability claims processing rules, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, unless the violation was the result of a minor error and other specified conditions are met. If the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, the claim or appeal is deemed denied on review without the exercise of discretion by a fiduciary and the claimant may immediately pursue his or her claim in court. The final rule also provides that the plan must treat a claim as re-filed on appeal upon the plan's receipt of a court's decision rejecting the claimant's request for review.\n  Coverage rescissions. Rescissions of coverage, including retroactive terminations due to alleged misrepresentation of fact (e.g. errors in the application for coverage) must be treated as adverse benefit determinations, thereby triggering the plan's appeals procedures. Rescissions for non-payment of premiums are not covered by this provision.\n  Culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The disability claims final rule requires that benefit denial notices have to be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner in certain situations. The final rule essentially adopts the ACA standard for group health benefit notices. Specifically, if a disability claimant's address is in a county where 10 percent or more of the population is literate only in the same non-English language, benefit denial notices must include a prominent statement in the relevant non-English language about the availability of language services. The plan would also be required to provide a verbal customer assistance process in the non-English language and provide written notices in the non-English language upon request.\n\nTiming of group health plan claims\n   Decisions on urgent health care claims must be made within 72 hours from the time the claim is made. There is also a 72-hour limit for decisions on appeals of denials of urgent care claims. For decisions on non-urgent claims, the regulations make a distinction between pre-service claims (group health claims that involve access to medical care) and post-service claims (claims that involve purely the payment or reimbursement of costs for medical care that has already been provided). The regulations require that pre-service claims be decided within a maximum of 15 days at the initial level, and 30 days on review of an adverse benefit determination. Decisions on post-service claims are subject to a maximum time period of 30 days for the initial decision and a maximum of 60 days on review of a denied claim (Reference 8 below).\n   During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan.\n   Notice requirements. The regulations create notice requirements in certain circumstances. In situations involving pre-service claims, plans will be required to provide a notice informing claimants that they failed to properly file a claim, if such is the case. However, this requirement will only be triggered by a communication from a claimant or a health care professional representing the claimant, and the notice may be provided orally unless requested in writing.\n   The regulations require that a plan inform a claimant of any protocol that was relied upon in denying a claim, and either supply the relevant protocol with the notice of denial or inform the claimant of its availability from the plan upon request and free of charge. Also, notifications of claim denials based on medical necessity, experimental treatment, or other similar exclusions or limits must either explain the scientific judgment of the plan or include a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request (Reference 9 below).\n   Appeal of claim denials. Claimants must be afforded 180 days in which to bring an appeal of a denied claim. The review must be conducted by a fiduciary who is neither the party who made the initial adverse determination nor a subordinate of that party (Reference 10 below). A plan administrator's affirmance of the denial of disability benefits in a first-level internal appeal is not an \"adverse benefit determi\u00ad nation\" and, as such, an ERISA plan is not required to provide a claimant with at least 180 days to file a mandatory second appeal (Reference 11 below).\n   The fiduciaries who review a claim denial that is based on a medical judgment must consult with a health care professional with appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the claim. The consultant must also be independent of any health care professional consulted in making the initial adverse benefit determination in that the reviewer must be different from, and not subordinate to, the individual involved in the initial determination. The reviewer need not be unaffiliated with the health plan in question.\n\nAppeals process under ACA\n   Under health reform legislation, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims (see KB-1 Topic 934).\n \nFor more information ...\n   Rules governing fiduciary responsibility are discussed beginning at r 25.

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Appendix 4.2 Vision Care and Hearing Care Plans\n\nVISION CARE AND HEARING CARE PLANS\n\nVISION CARE\n\n\tMost of us would rank vision as a very important, if not the most important, of our senses. Yet vision care is often neglected. Eye disease, treatment, and surgery are traditionally covered under hospital, surgical, major medical, and comprehensive medical policies. However, most of these plans exclude routine vision examination and eyewear from coverage. Separate (freestanding) vision plans cover services such as routine examinations and materials (products) such as lenses, frames, and contact lenses. In a purist sense, some do not consider this coverage insurance, because of the absence of illness or disease. Nevertheless, the need for appropriate vision care is real, as about 60 percent of the adult population in North America wears corrective eyewear. A routine vision examination not only confirms whether prescription eyewear is necessary but may detect unrelated problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Aside from the obvious medical benefits to employees, vision care plans have the potential of reducing accidents and increasing productivity-factors that are of major importance to the employer. Vision care is often compared to dental care because of its frequently elective and predictable nature. However, despite general reductions in employee benefit programs, some though not many employers are adding or continuing to provide vision care benefits.\n\nProviders\n\n\tThere are three types of vision care professionals:\n\n\t1. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors (MDs) specializing in the total care of the eye, including diagnosis, treatment of eye diseases, and surgery. Many perform eye examinations and prescribe corrective lenses. Some also dispense corrective eyewear. An ophthalmologist typically completes four years of premedical training, another four years of medical school, and subsequent internship and residency.\n\n\t2. Optometrists are doctors of optometry (ODs) and are licensed to examine, diagnose, treat, and manage diseases and disorders of the visual system, the eye, and associated structures as well as diagnose related systemic conditions. They are trained to detect eye disease and/or symptoms requiring the attention of ophthalmologists. In addition to performing vision examinations and prescribing lenses, most optometrists dispense glasses and contact lenses. An optometrist typically completes undergraduate work and is graduated from a college of optometry.\n\n\t3. Opticians fit, adjust, and dispense eyewear (lenses, frames, and contact lenses) prescribed by ophthalmologists and optometrists. They are eyewear retailers and provide advice on which lenses and frames are most appropriate. Many grind and fabricate eyewear, verify the finished products, and repair and replace various ophthalmic devices. Optician certification, licensure, and registration vary by state, as do training and apprenticeship.\n\nCovered Benefits\n\n\tCovered benefits include vision examination, lenses, and frames.\n\nVision Examination\n\n\tA thorough examination includes a history of general health, vision complaints, and an external and internal eye examination. Other services may include various ocular tests, usually including, but not limited to, coordination of eye movements, tonometry, depth perception (for children), and refraction testing for distance and near vision. In addition to the possible need for corrective eyewear, the examination could detect cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, and brain tumors. Some plans allow an examination at 12- or 24-month intervals, and it is up to the employee to arrange for eyewear if needed. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) often feature \"exam-only\" plans.\n\nLenses\n\tThe lens is the heart of sight-corrective material. Single-vision lenses are the most widely used, with multivision lenses (bifocal or trifocal) also being dispensed in large quantities. Plastic has replaced glass as the predominant lens material, and a wide array of lenses, such as oversized, photochromic, and tinted, are available. Most plans consider these \"cosmetic extras\" and outside normal plan limits. Many plans do provide benefits for contact lenses even though they are likely to be worn for cosmetic rather than for medical reasons.\n\n\tMany dispensers have an in-house laboratory for grinding and fab\u00ad rication of the more routinely prescribed eyewear, while others use full service laboratories.\n\nFrames\n\n\tThe cosmetic element is much more obvious in the area of frames than in lenses. Frames are increasingly being selected for cosmetic purposes and at times are part of a fashion wardrobe. The cost can run into hundreds of dollars for plastic or metal frames of almost limitless sizes, shapes, and colors. Herein lies a dilemma for the payor. The frame is a must, but how does one avoid paying for fashion while giving a fair reimbursement for utility? Certain plans make allowances up to a specified dollar figure, while others approve a limited selection; for example, $100 frames each for men, women, and children.\n\nPlan Design\n\n\tPlan design include frequency limits, schedule-of-benefits approach, and preferred provider networks.\n\nFrequency Limits\n\n\tTo control unnecessary use and keep administrative costs down, plans use a time limit (frequency) with which a participant may utilize a benefit plan for covered expenses. Examples of frequencies allowed by four plans are noted in Table A4.2-l.\n\nSchedule-of-Benefits Approach\n\n\tThis type of plan has maximum allowances for each service and material and a limit on the frequency of use. Examples are shown in Table A4.2-2. A typical schedule pays the lesser of the claimed or schedule maximum.\n\n\nT A B L E\tA4.2\u00b71\n\nExamples of Frequencies with Which Participants May Access Benefits\n\n\t\t\tMonth Intervals\n\t\tPlan 1\tPlan 2\tPlan 3\tPlan 4\nExaminations\t24\t12\t12\t12\nLenses\t\t24\t24\t12\t12\nFrames\t\t24\t24\t24\t12\n\n\n\tSchedules can be national or regional, based on a geographic per\u00ad centage of usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) charges.\n\n\tAdvantages of a schedule-of-benefits plan are that it is easy to understand, it has no restriction on the choice of provider, and it encourages the thrifty employee to shop around. The employer is cognizant of premium outlay, as the schedule ceiling does not change with inflation, and administration is simplified for the insurer or administrator because the frequencies and caps are determined in advance.\n\nT A B L E\tA4.2\u00b72\n\nExamples of Maximum Allowances for Vision Care Plans\n\nService/Material\tMaximum Allowed($)\nExamination\t\t\t50\nLenses (pair)\nSingle-vision\t\t\t60\nBifocal\t\t\t\t90\nTrifocal\t\t\t110\nLenticular\t\t\t140\nContacts (elective)\t\t100\nFrames\t\t\t\t60\n \n\nPreferred Provider Networks\n\n\tPreferred provider plans steer employees to a network of participating providers that have agreed to provide certain services for a negotiated fee. Employees who use a provider in the network may have many of the plan benefits covered 100 percent or pay only a minimum copayment, usually from $5 to $20. There is no claim form for the employee. An employee simply shows an identification card, which can be subject to confirmation at the provider's place of business, or the employee can mail a request for vision services and materials to the administrator and receive a benefit form stating which benefits are available and for what length of time, and the extent of the copayment.\n\n\tProviders are solicited by the insurer or administrator with the expectation of increased patient volume. In return, the provider agrees to reimbursement of discounted material costs plus dispensing fees. Some plans also mandate the use of specific laboratories. Various quality control measures are inserted into these plans, and peer review is common. In some plans, participating providers can charge the regular retail price for over\u00adsized or tinted lenses and for designer frames, while others call for reduced charges for these extras.\n\n\tMost plans allow reimbursement even when a participating provider is not utilized. In these instances, the employee must pay the provider's charge and file a claim. Reimbursement is based on a schedule or UCR determination. When a non-network provider is used, the employee's out\u00adof-pocket expense is almost always greater than it would be with a participating provider. Figure A4.2-3 illustrates a sample plan.\n\n\tThese plans usually follow a medical plan pattern, with a percentile of the charges in a given area prevailing. A higher figure is allowed for examination and lenses, and less for lenses of a cosmetic nature. Inflation is shared with the employee, with a percentage of coinsurance applied with the medical reimbursement. A separate means of administration is unnecessary.\n\nVision Benefits in Flexible Benefit Plans\n\n\tFlex plans increasingly include ancillary benefits, including vision care. They enable an employee to choose among various coverages, taking into account factors such as overall health, spouse coverage, and specific family needs. Although the design of these plans varies, employers sometimes allocate a certain number of \"flex credits\" to each employee, who then uses these to \"purchase\" benefits. Each employee chooses the benefits that best\n\n\nF I G U R E\tA4.2\u00b73\n\nPreferred Provider Network Sample Plan\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn-Network\t\tOut-of-Network (Program Allowance)\nExam (every 12 months)\t\t\t100%\t\t\t$32\n\nFrames (every 12 months)\t\t100%\t\t\t$24\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(up to $60 retail value)\n\nLenses (every 12 months)\t\t100%\t\t\t$24 single vision\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$36 bifocal\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$46 trifocal\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$72 aphakic/lenticular\n\nContact lenses (every 12 months in lieu of glasses)\n\nPrescription and fitting\t\t100%\t\t\t$20 daily wear\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$30 extended wear\n\nStandard\t\t\t\t100%\t\t\t$48\n\nSpecialty\t\t\t\t100%\t\t\t$48 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(up to $75 retail value)\n\nVision Care Options*\t\t\t10% discount\t\tNot covered\n\n(such as tints, contact lens solution)\n\n\u2022These allowances and discounts are only available at the point of purchase.\n\nfit his or her needs. Once the employer allocation has been used, the employee may purchase additional benefits at his or her own cost. They place vision care in competition with other coverages.\n\nFlexible Spending Accounts\n\n\tIf not covered under a medical plan or a freestanding plan, eligible vision care expenses often are covered by some type of spending account. Under a flexible spending account (FSA) arrangement, the employee may reduce income and Social Security taxes by funding benefits such as vision care with pretax dollars. At the beginning of the plan year, employees can designate a certain amount of money (up to a maximum) to be deducted from salary, thereby reducing the base upon which taxes are paid. The employer holds the money and \"reimburses\" the employee upon verification of covered expenses. (See Chapter 25 for a complete discussion of flex plans and FSAs.) Alternatively, vision care expenses are eligible for reimburse\u00ad ment under a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement account (HRA) if an employee participates in such plans.\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n\tOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to provide protective eyewear to employees in positions exposing them to the danger of eye injury. These \"safety glass\" programs are usually outside the normal health benefit package.\n\nHEARING CARE\n\n\tA majority of benefit packages do not contain this coverage. The aging population, coupled with a noisy contemporary society, contributes to hearing loss and impairment, and it is estimated that more than 10 percent of the population is affected. Despite the generally acknowledged increase in the number of hearing-impaired persons and the substantially improved technology of hearing-aid instruments available, many would rather con\u00ad tinue with this impairment than bear the stigma of wearing a hearing aid in public.\n\nCoverage\n\n\tSurgical procedures affecting the ear are normally covered in standard medical policies. Beyond this, some HMOs and major medical and comprehensive policies include hearing aids. However, more complete coverage is afforded by plans designed specifically to cover hearing care.\n\nHearing Care Benefits\n\n\tA common benefit package includes an 80 percent reimbursement of services and materials up to a ceiling of $300 to $600. The frequency of benefit availability is usually every 36 months. The following items are often covered:\n\n\t\u25a0 Otologic examination (by a physician or surgeon)\n\t\u25a0 Audiometric examination (by an audiologist)\n\t\u25a0 Hearing instrument (including evaluation, ear mold fitting, and follow-up visits)\n\n\tPreferred provider plans in which access to a panel would result in discounts for audiologist fees as well as hearing-aid instruments are also available. Several administrators have developed service plans in which copayments apply when participating providers are utilized. Material costs can be reimbursed on a cost-plus dispensing-fee basis. However, identical procedures vary in different geographic areas and even within specific metropolitan areas.\n\n\tAs with vision care expenses, an FSA is a convenient vehicle through which to budget for hearing care expenses in the absence of employee benefit coverage.\n\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

Although we may not like to think about a time in our lives when we may need personal assistance in performing some of the basic activities of daily living, like eating or\n\nTABLE 12-1\n\nConditions That May Require Long-Term Care (LTC)\n\n\u25a0 Head injury\t\t\u25a0 Rheumatoid arthritis\n\u25a0 Stroke\t\t\u25a0 Parkinson's disease\n\u25a0 Cancer\t\t\u25a0 Alzheimer's disease\n\u25a0 Multiple sclerosis\t\u25a0 Paralysis\n\u25a0 Heart disease\t\t\u25a0 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease)\n\ndressing, the need for LTC can happen to anyone at any time. In fact, of the 12.1 million Americans currently needing LTC, 41.3 percent are under age 65 (Reference 2 below).\n\nImpact of National Demographics\n\tOf course, aging is an important factor in determining the potential need for LTC. While recent medical advances have contributed to our overall longevity, they have not necessarily improved the quality of life, particularly in terms of the ability to function independently. It is estimated that at least 70 percent of people over the age of 65 will require LTC services at some point in their lives (Reference 3 below). Looking ahead, we can expect the number of care recipients to skyrocket, as 78.2 million baby boomers begin turning 65 in 2011.\n\nCurrent and Projected Costs\n\tThere is also the matter of expense. The national average for nursing home stays is almost $75,000 annually, with home care costs averaging nearly $40,000 a year (Reference 4 below). According to one survey, 64 percent of Americans age 45 and older think that the recent economic downturn has hurt their ability to\n\nTABLE 12-2\nGeographic Variations in Cost of Care\n\n\tNursing Home Semi-Private (Daily)\tHome Health Care (Hourly)\nAtlanta, GA\t$159\t$17.44\nBoston, MA\t$289\t$22\nChicago, IL\t$148\t$19.65\nDenver, CO\t$194\t$19.69\nHouston, TX\t$128\t$17.28\nLos Angeles, CA\t$151\t$21\nMinneapolis, MN\t$147\t$26.50\nNashville, TN\t$161\t$17.42\nNew York, NY\t$373\t$17.23\nPhoenix, AZ\t$161\t$20.53\nSeattle, WA\t$221\t$24.28\nTampa, FL\t$193\t$18.72\n\nSource: Based on the John Hancock Cost of Care Survey, conducted by CareScout, 2008.\n\npay for LTC services should they be unable to take care of themselves for an extended period of time (Reference 5 below).\n\tThe cost of care can vary widely, as illustrated in Table 12-2.\n\tLike everything else, LTC expenses are expected to rise. By some estimates, the projected cost for a three- to five-year care event in 30 years will be $750,000 to 1,250,000 (based on the John Hancock 2008 Cost of Care Survey and projected at the average rate of inflation of 4.1 percent over the 50-year period ending December 31, 2009).\n\nLack of Traditional Care Resources\n\tThe issues surrounding LTC have changed, along with the social fabric of the country. At one time, it was common for LTC services to be provided by family members, with women taking on most of the responsibility for caregiving. This might have been a reasonable option years ago, when grown children tended to settle near their parents and women stayed at home. In today's society, children may live across the country or on the other side of the world. And, many more women are active in the work\u00adforce and may not be able to fulfill the traditional caregiver role.\n\tEven if that were not the case, caregiving can place a burden on family members that most people would prefer to avoid. A survey of caregivers revealed that 83 percent were concerned with losing their physical or mental health as a result of their caregiving responsibilities (Reference 6 below).\n\nMisconceptions about Who Pays for Care\n\tIn the absence of unpaid, informal care, individuals look to other resources for funding. Unfortunately, misconceptions abound, with many people thinking they can rely on existing employee benefits or government programs. Let us review some of the most common held misconceptions.\n\nLTC Is Covered by Medical or Disability Benefits\n\tHealth insurance is designed to provide coverage for illnesses that are acute, or short term, in nature. It will pay for hospital stays or doctor's care for conditions where recovery is expected, for example, kidney stones or a broken leg. Most health insurance will not pay for a home health aide to help manage a chronic illness at home or for the nursing home care that may be needed after the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\n\tLikewise, long-term disability (LTD) insurance is designed to replace income, not cover LTC costs. In addition, LTD usually ceases at age 65-though the need for LTC does not.\n\nMedicare Pays for LTC\n\tMedicare is a national health insurance program designed to assist people age 65 and older with their medical expenses. It is intended to pay for acute illnesses, where recovery is expected. Medicare does pay some LTC expenses, but certain requirements must be met. Benefits may be paid for the first 100 days in a nursing home, if confinement takes place within 30 days following a hospitalization of at least three days and if skilled care is being received. Unfortunately, most conditions requiring LTC do not call for hospitalization or skilled care, for example, Alzheimer's disease or rheumatoid arthritis, so Medicare may only be of limited usefulness to a minority of LTC recipients.\n\nMedicaid Pays for LTC\n\tThe other government program that some individuals view as a personal safety net is Medicaid. Medicaid was created to help low-income families with their medical expenses, but has unintentionally become one of the leading ways to fund the cost of LTC.\n\tRecent legislation, specifically the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act in 2005, has made it more difficult to transfer assets in order to qualify for benefits, forcing individuals to spend down to state-prescribed levels before being considered Medicaid-eligible. Regrettably, this strategy can put other family members at serious financial risk. Moreover, it can limit choices regarding care, since Medicaid primarily pays for nursing home, rather than home care.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n2.

With a true group plan, the employer is the policy\u00adholder and employees are issued certificates of insurance. The employer can choose to include retirees, spouses, adult children, parents/in-laws, and siblings as part of the eligible group. With a multilife approach, individual insureds are the policyholders and are issued individual policies. In most cases, true group is a better match for larger employers, particularly those with widely dispersed populations. True group plans offer the following advantages:\n\u25a0 Availability of guaranteed issue for eligible, actively-at work employees\n\u25a0 No minimum participation requirements\n\u25a0 Fully portable coverage\n\u25a0 Low group rates, in many cases, with a rate guarantee period\n\u25a0 Transfer of reserve capabilities\n\u25a0 Turnkey approach to enrollment and administration\n\u25a0 Employer-dedicated website to support enrollment\n\tA multilife approach may be attractive to smaller employers or those wishing to give their employees greater flexibility in customizing their coverage. Some other advantages of a multilife approach are\n\u25a0 Simplified underwriting for eligible, actively at work employees\n\u25a0 Availability of preferred health and spousal/family member discounts\n\u25a0 Broker-assisted enrollments, with one-on-one consultations\n\u25a0 Availability of list and split billing\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 884 - Health Care Reform - Group Market Rules - Coverage for Adult Children\n\n    A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance that provides dependent coverage of children must continue to make health coverage available for an adult child until the child turns 26 years old. Health plans or health insurers are not, however, required to cover a child of the adult child receiving dependent coverage (Reference 1 below).\n    In a separate change made by the ACA, the tax exclusion for employer\u00adprovided health benefits has been extended to include an adult child \"who as of the end of the taxable year has not attained age 27\" (also see KB-1 Topic 956) (Reference 2 below).\n    A child includes a son, daughter, stepchild, adopted child, or eligible foster child (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: The exclusion applies only for reimbursements for medical care of individuals who are not age 27 or older at any time during the taxable year. For example, a child born on Dec. 10, 1992, attains age 27 on Dec. 10, 2019. For this individual, the tax exclusion is available only through 2018. Employers may rely on the employee's representation as to the child's date of birth (Reference 4 below).\n    Restrictions on plan definition of dependent. Group health plans may not use student status, residency, or financial support from a parent to deny or restrict dependent coverage to children (Reference 5 below). Examples of factors that cannot be used for defining dependent for purposes of eligibility (or continued eligibility) include:\n\u2022 financial dependency on the participant or primary subscriber (or any other person),\n\u2022 residency with the participant or primary subscriber (or any other person),\n\u2022 student status,\n\u2022 employment,\n\u2022 eligibility for other coverage,\n\u2022 living, working or residing in an HMO's service area or other network service area (for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017);\n\u2022 marital status, or\n\u2022 any combination of these factors.\n    Example: A group health plan offers a choice of self-only or family health coverage. Dependent coverage is provided under family health coverage for children of participants who have not attained age 26. The plan imposes an additional premium surcharge for children who are older than age 18.\n    The plan violates the age rule because the plan varies the terms for dependent coverage of children based on age.\n    The age rule does not prohibit distinctions based upon age that apply to all coverages under the plan, including coverage for employees and spouses as well as dependent children.\n    Example: A group health plan normally charges a copayment for physician visits that do not constitute preventive services. The plan charges this copayment to individuals age 19 and over, including employees, spouses, and dependent children, but waives it for those under age 19 (Reference 6 below).\n    The copayments charged to dependent children are the same as those charged to employees and spouses. Accordingly, the arrangement does not violate the age rule (Reference 7 below).\n    Effects on Code Sec. 125 plans and HRAs. Code Sec. 125 cafeteria plan regulations currently do not permit election changes for children younger than age 27 who are not the employee's dependents. The IRS intends to amend IRS Reg. \u00a7 1.125-4, effective retroactively to March 30, 2010, to include change-in-status events affecting nondependent children younger than age 27, including becoming newly eligible for coverage or eligible for coverage beyond the date on which the child otherwise would have lost coverage (Reference 8 below).\n    The same rules for an employee's child younger than age 27 apply to a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), an arrangement that is paid for solely by an employer (not through a Code Sec. 125 plan) and which reimburses an employee for medical care expenses up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period.\n    VEBAs, Sec. 401(h) accounts, and Code Sec. 162(1) deductions. The same general rules for providing a tax exclusion to children younger than age 27 also apply to the following provisions (Reference 9 below):\n\u2022 voluntary employee beneficiary associations (VEBAs) providing for the payment of sick and accident benefits to members;\n\u2022 Code Sec. 401(h) accounts that provide for the payment of benefits for sickness, accident, hospitalization, and medical expenses; and\n\u2022 Code Sec. 162(1), which allows self-employed individuals to deduct amounts paid during the taxable year for insurance that constitutes medical care.\n    Retiree-only plan or excepted benefits. The health reform provisions extending health coverage to adult children under age 26 do not apply to retiree-only plans or excepted benefits. Excepted benefits generally include dental-only and vision-only plans, most health flexible spending arrangements, Medigap policies, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage (Reference 10 below).\n    Comment: HSA distributions for covered dependents. Because the ACA did not amend Code Sec. 223, which governs HSAs, it appears that HSAs cannot reimburse medical expenses for adult children on a tax-free basis unless the child otherwise qualifies as a tax dependent of the account holder (in other words, the law before health reform). Any HSA reimbursements for medical expenses of adult children would be treated as nonqualified reimbursements subject to income inclusion and penalties, which increased from 10% to 20% in 2011.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nl PHSA \u00a7 2714.\t\t\n2 Code Sec. 105(b).\n3 Code Sec. 152(f).\t\t\n4 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n5 Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2714(b).\n6 Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2714(e).\n7 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Implementation Part V, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq\u00adaca5.html.\n8 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n9 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n10 Preamble to regulations issued jointly by EBSA, IRS, and HHS (75 FR 34538), June 17, 2010.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 370 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Health Insurance Benefits\n    The type of protection afforded employees depends on the kinds of benefits being provided and the way in which they are paid. Payment may be through insurance premiums, via a trust or fund, or directly from the employer. Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage or incur costs such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nHealth insurance\n    Health insurance may be an umbrella for medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits, although each of these may also be separate plans or part of a cafeteria plan (see KB-1 Topic 2000). In addition, specific benefits such as mental health, substance abuse management, and prescription drugs, although often part of the health plan, are receiving separate attention due to escalating costs and societal concerns.\n    Medical. Medical coverage protects employees and their families from the total cost burden of the treatment of disease, illness, pregnancy and birth, or accidents and the prevention of disease. Medical. plans cover care delivered in hospitals, physicians' offices, and outpatient settings. Increasingly, the cost of the coverage is shared between employers and employees through employee contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n    Dental. Dental plans cover treatment and preventive care of the teeth, gums, and mouth. Coverage normally is provided through insured plans, self-insured plans, and health maintenance organizations. Plan design varies for certain types of care, such as orthodontia, preventive mali:i.tenance, cosmetic and voluntary procedures, and for coinsurance percentages (see KB-1 Topic 385).\n    Vision. A vision plan is not a common benefit, although certain injuries to eyes may be covered under most medical plans. A vision benefit plan could underwrite the cost of eye examinations, eyeglasses or contact lenses, and eye surgery. Some provide discounted prices for eyeglasses and examinations (see KB-1 Topic 390).\n    Hearing. Separate hearing benefit plans occur in a few union plans, but are a rarity. The plans provide payment for the diagnosis, fitting, and purchase of hearing aids and the treatment of hearing loss.\n    Mental health. Mental health coverage is usually part of the medical plan, although some companies have provided employee assistance programs (EAPs), preferred provider networks (PPOs), and managed care counselling to facilitate treatment outside the traditional medical plan. The benefit plan generally covers a certain number of days per year in an inpatient setting or pays a portion of the cost of outpatient treatment for a specified number of visits to a licensed provider.\n    Pointer: Annual and lifetime dollar limits can be no more restrictive than the limits for medical/surgical coverage. In the past, the Mental Health Parity Act contained a sunset provision. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the mental health parity provisions will no longer expire. In addition, the provisions have been enhanced and substance abuse coverage has been added. For more information, see r 400.\n    Substance abuse management. \u00b7treatment for substance abuse has also become a growth industry and a problem for employers. Inpatient detoxification is normally part of the medical plan or health maintenance organization coverage (see KB-1 Topic 405). However, ongoing outpatient therapy often is arranged on an exception basis by the insurer and the employer, using a case manager as an intermediary (see r 960).\n    Prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is part of most medical plans. Independent drug plans, however, have become a popular alternative for larger companies as an adjunct to the medical plan. These offer generic drug substitution at prices lower than available over the counter and are often done on a mail-order basis. Prescription drug plans can produce cost savings for beneficiaries undergoing long-term therapies to treat illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure (see r 380).\n \nPayment mechanisms\n    Benefits may be insured, partially insured, or self-insured. Further, they are funded, self-funded, or unfunded. This terminology refers to the manner in which an employer shares the risk of the cost of claims and pays for the coverage (see also KB-1 Topic 500).\n\nInsured benefits\n    Medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits may be fully insured through insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, health mainte\u00ad nance organizations, preferred provider networks, associations, or welfare funds.\n    Fully insured benefits. When benefits are fully insured, the insurer estimates the total claim liability for all employees and beneficiaries and adds the projected cost for expenses such as administration, marketing, accounting reserves and trend to develop a cost for the plan year. This estimate represents the total cost for the employer for the plan year. The insurer absorbs any charges above the amount and profit when the total costs are below the estimate. The employer remits a premium on a monthly basis to the insurer.\n    Partially insured arrangement. Under a partially insured arrangement, a portion of estimated claims is insured, usually under stop loss policies, while the rest of the claims are paid on a self-insured basis.\n    Self-insured benefits. An employer that self-insures reimburses the claim payer for claims as they come due or on a delayed basis under agreement with the claim payer. In a self-insured arrangement, the employer assumes the responsibility for the entire cost of paying and processing the claims. A company contracting with an outside provider, such as a managed care vendor or mail-order drug supplier, may negotiate a contract involving minimal risk on either party and pay a charge based on the number of participants per month or on a formula representing the actual costs.\n\nFunding\n    Regardless of whether benefits are provided through insurance or self-insurance, the employer may fully or partially fund the benefits. A fully funded plan involves setting aside anticipated claim costs on a regular basis, sometimes using a trust. An unfunded plan would deduct claim costs from the general assets of the employer on an as-needed basis, with no advance reserving or budgeting. Sometimes funding arrangements are negotiated that involve a delay in remitting payment, subject to an interest charge.\n    A smaller employer is more likely to fully insure and fully fund a welfare benefit program, while larger companies tend to self-insure and self-fund, often with some form of stop-loss insurance as protection against catastrophic claims (see KB-1 Topic 470).\n \nEmployee cost participation\n    Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of insurance. In addition, employees often share in the cost of benefits through deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments (see KB-1 Topic 375).\n\nFor more information ...\n    Employer funding of health plans is discussed at KB-1 Topic 455.\n"

Like an HMO, the insurance company negotiates discounts with physicians and the hospitals and adds them to its \"network\" of providers. Employees enrolled in a PPO plan are encouraged to choose doctors and hospitals from the network. Employees who do choose providers from withing the network usually pay a set amount per office visit (typically $10 to $30) with the insurance company paying the rest.\n\n                        Unlike an HMO, PPO networks are generally smaller and you can see a specialist without having to see a Primary Care Physician (PCP) first. Also, you can see a physician outside of the network and you'll probably have your cost covered (although likely at a lower rate than for in-network physicians). However, premiums are usually higher than in HMOs and it's usual to have a deductible amount you have to meet each plan year before coverage kicks in.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Preferred-Provider Organizations\n\n\tA concept that continues to receive considerable attention from employers and insurance companies is the preferred-provider organization. A few PPOs existed on a small scale for many years, but since the early 1980s PPOs have grown steadily in number and in membership. Today, PPOs provide coverage for medical expenses to more Americans than do HMOs, primarily because of the flexibility of covered persons to choose their own medical providers.\n\nWhat Is a PPO?\npreferred-provider organization (PPO)\n\tThe term preferred-provider organization (PPO) tends to be used in two ways. One way is to apply it to health care providers that contract with employers, insurance companies, union trust funds, third-party administrators, or others to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. Using this definition, a PPO may be organized by the providers themselves or by other organizations, such as insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, or employers. Like HMOs, they may take the form of group practices or separate individual practices. They may provide a broad array of medical services, including physicians' services, hospital care, laboratory costs, and home health care, or they may be limited only to hospitalization or physicians' services. Some of these organizations are very specialized and provide specific services, such as dental care, mental health benefits, substance abuse services, maternity care, or prescription drugs. This book refers to these providers not as PPOs but as preferred providers or network providers.\n\tThe second use of the term PPO, and the one generally assumed when the term is used throughout this book, is to apply it to benefit plans that contract with preferred providers to obtain lower-cost care for plan members. PPOs typically differ from HMOs in several respects. First, the PPO generally pays the preferred providers on a fee-for-service basis as their services are used. However, fees are usually subject to a schedule that is the same for all similar providers within the provider network, and providers may have an incentive to control utilization through bonus arrangements. Second, employees and their dependents are not required to use the practitioners or facilities that contract with the PPO; rather, they can make a choice each time medical care is needed, and the PPO also pays benefits for care provided that nonnetwork providers furnish. However, employees have incentives to use network providers; they include lower or reduced deductibles and copayments as well as increased benefits, such as preventive health care. Third, most PPOs do not use a primary care physician as a gatekeeper; employees do not need referrals to see specialists.\n\tEmployers were disappointed with some of the early PPOs. Although discounts were available to members, they seemed to have little effect on benefit costs because discounts were from higher-than-average fees, or providers were more likely to perform diagnostic tests or prolong hospital stays to generate additional fees to compensate for the discounts. These PPOs seldom lasted long. Successful PPOs today emphasize quality care and utilization review. In selecting physicians and hospitals, PPOs look both at the type of care provided and the provider's cost effectiveness. In this era of fierce competition among medical care providers, these physicians and hospitals are often willing to accept discounts in hopes of increasing patient volume. It is also important for a PPO to monitor and control utilization on an ongoing basis and to deal with groups of preferred providers that monitor their own costs and utilization. Generally, however, PPOs do not monitor their preferred providers as closely as HMOs do.\n\nVariations\n\tOver time, PPOs have continued to evolve. A few PPOs compensate providers on a capitation basis, and a few others perform a gatekeeper function. If a member's primary care physician does not recommend a specialist, PPO benefits may be reduced. With these changes, it is sometimes difficult to determine the exact form of a managed care organization. However, those that operate as traditional HMOs generally provide medical expense coverage at a slightly lower cost than do those that operate as traditional PPOs, but there are wide variations among HMOs as well as among PPOs. Therefore, a careful analysis of quality of care, cost, and financial stability is necessary before the selection of a particular HMO or PPO.\n\nexclusive-provider organization (EPO)\n\tAnother variation of the PPO is the exclusive-provider organization, or EPO. The primary difference is that an EPO does not provide coverage outside the preferred-provider network, except in emergencies and those infrequent cases when the network does not contain an appropriate specialist. This aspect of an EPO makes it very similar to an HMO. The number of EPOs is small.\n\nSponsorship\n\tInsurance companies and the Blues established most of the early PPOs to provide products to compete with HMOs. In the early part of this decade, the number of PPOs grew significantly to over 1,000. However, primarily because of mergers, the number has decreased. The majority are still owned by insurance companies and the Blues. Some are owned by HMOs to give them another product in their health plan portfolios to offer employers. Others have a variety of ownership forms, including third-party administrators, private investors, and groups of physicians and/or hospitals.\n\nBenefit Structure\ncenters of excellence\n\tThe basic benefit structure of a PPO is very similar to that of the traditional comprehensive major medical contract. The most significant difference is that there is a higher level of benefits for care received from network providers than there is for care received from nonnetwork providers. Many PPOs have extensive networks of preferred providers, particularly in the geographic areas in which they operate, and there is little reason to seek care outside the network. Some of these PPOs also have reciprocity agreements elsewhere with networks of other PPOs and hospitals (called centers of excellence) that have excellent outcomes and reputations for certain types of medical procedures, such as cancer treatment, organ transplants, or burn treatment. Under these agreements, the PPO pays benefits as if a member receives care from network providers. Other PPOs have more limited networks, and the need and desire for treatment from nonnetwork providers is greater.\n\tThe level of benefits under PPOs may vary because of differences in deductibles, coinsurance, and precertification rules. There may also be a few additional benefits that are available only if a member receives care from a network provider. Finally, the procedures for filing claims also differ. The major purpose of these differences is to encourage an employee or dependent to receive care from preferred providers who agree to charge the plan a discounted fee.\n\nDeductibles\n\tA PPO may have annual deductibles that apply separately to network and nonnetwork charges. For examples, these might be $500 and $1,000, respectively. However, some PPOs have no deductible for network charges. A PPO may waive deductibles for some medical services, such as emergency services.\n\nCoinsurance\n\tPPOs often use coinsurance percentages that are 20 percent (and occasionally 30 percent) lower when a member receives care from nonnetwork providers. A frequently found provision applies 90 percent coinsurance to network charges and 70 percent coinsurance to nonnetwork charges. Coinsurance provisions of 100/80, 90/80, 100/70, and 80/60 are also commonly used. As with deductibles, a PPO may waive the percentage participation for certain medical services. In addition, different stop-loss limits or coinsurance caps, such as $1,000 and $3,000, may apply to network and nonnetwork charges.\n\tAlthough PPOs typically have higher coinsurance percentages for network charges than do traditional major medical plans, a covered person may be responsible for copayments in some circumstances. For example, there might be a copayment, typically ranging from $10 to $25, for each a visit to a primary care physician.\n\nallowable charge\n\tIn evaluating PPOs, it is important to determine the basis the PPO uses to apply the coinsurance percentage. For example, assume a plan uses 80 percent coinsurance for nonnetwork charges and that a charge of $100 is incurred for a medical procedure from a nonnetwork provider. Most PPOs first determine whether this charge is usual, customary, and reasonable. If it is, the plan pays $80. If the plan determines that the usual, customary, and reasonable charge is $90, it will be 80 percent of that amount, or $72. However, some plans apply the coinsurance percentage to what they often refer to as an allowable charge. In most cases, this is the amount that the PPO pays to network providers for the same procedure. In some cases, network discounts are quite large and, for example, the allowable charge in this example might be only $60. For a nonnetwork charge, the plan pays 80 percent of this amount, or $48. Thus the insured has an out-of-pocket expense of $52. Few employees and their families will seek nonnetwork care under this type of plan. For this reason, plans that pay nonnetwork charges on this basis are sometimes referred to as phantom PPOs.\n\nPrecertification Rules\n\tPPOs often have precertification requirements for many types of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, and medical supplies. For network benefits, the person responsible for obtaining the needed certification is the network provider, and the PPO does not penalize a member if the network provider fails to obtain the proper precertification. (This becomes an issue between the PPO and the provider.) However, this responsibility shifts to the employee or family member for nonnetwork services. If he or she does not obtain a required precertification, there usually is a reduction in benefits. For example, what was once 80 percent coinsurance might shrink to 60 percent.\n\nAdditional Network Benefits\n\tFor the most part, PPOs pay benefits for the same medical procedures, whether a network or a nonnetwork provider performs them. However, some PPOs cover a few procedures only if a member receives them from network providers.\n\nClaims\n\tNo claim forms are required for network services. The covered person merely pays any required copayment, and the provider of medical services does the paperwork needed to receive the additional amounts payable by the plan. Just as in traditional major medical plans, it is the ultimate responsibility of the covered person to file the claims forms necessary to receive benefits for nonnetwork care. Of course, the provider may do much of the paperwork and accept an assignment of benefits.\n\nExample\nThe following table shows excerpts of the benefit structure from a sample PPO.\n\nTable 9-2 Selected Benefits under a Sample PPO\n\tNetwork Benefit\tNonnetwork Benefit\nDeductible\tNone\t$500 per person per year. Family deductible equals 2 times the individual deductible. The deductible does not apply to emergency care or preventive\nservices.\nCoinsurance\t100% for most services\t70% for most services\nOut-of-pocket Limit\tNone\t$2,000\nLifetime Maximum\tUnlimited\tUnlimited\nHospital Services\t100% with a $250 copayment\nper hospitalization\t70% with a $500 copayment per\nadmission\nEmergency Room\t100% with $50 copayment\nper visit\t100% with $50 copayment per visit\nSurgical Services\t100%\t70%\nOutpatient Diagnostic Services\t100%\t70%\nCardiac Rehabilitation Therapy\n(limit 18 sessions per benefit period)\t100% with $15 copayment per session\t70%\nPsychiatric Services\t\t\nInpatient\t100%\t70%\n\t100% for 9 visits with $10\t\nOutpatient\tcopayment; $20 copayment\t\n\tthereafter\t50%\nOutpatient Diabetic Education\t100%\t70%\nPhysician Service\t100% with $20 copayment\nper visit for primary care physicians; $30 copayment for specialists\t70%\nPrescription Drugs\t100% with $10 copayment\nfor generic drugs and $20 for nongeneric drugs\t50%\n\nRegulation\n\tPPOs initially were subject to much less stringent regulation than HMOs with respect to their managed care activities. In fact, they were largely unregulated. As a result, the NAIC created the Preferred Provider Arrangements Model Act, which the majority of states adopted. The act is relatively brief and establishes only a minimal regulatory framework. The act requires that PPOs incorporate cost-containment mechanisms, such as utilization review, to determine whether a service is medically necessary. Covered persons must have reasonable access to medical services. The act also allows PPOs to provide incentives for persons to use the preferred-provider network and to place limitations on the number and types of providers with whom they contract.\n\tNote that most PPO contracts also meet the definition of insurance and are subject to the same regulation by state insurance departments as traditional insurance contracts with respect to contract provisions and benefit mandates.\n\n\n \n"

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider. Unlike HMOs, which determine fees on a per-person basis, however, PPOs determine fees on a per-service basis.\n    The following provider, financial, and customer-service factors should be considered in evaluating PPO performance:\n\nProvider information\n    Provider information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How are providers solicited and screened?\n\u25a1 Are there sufficient network providers for good freedom of choice?\n\u25a1 Are network providers accessible to employees?\n\u25a1 What is the turnover of providers in the program?\n\u25a1 Are providers generally available or are there special schedules?\n\u25a1 What providers are in the network, and are they the same providers employees use?\n\nFinancial information\n    Financial information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How long has the PPO been in existence?\n\u25a1 Is the sponsor financially sound?\n\u25a1 Are there administrative costs?\n\u25a1 What is the effect on insurance premiums?\n\u25a1 How much are the provider discounts?\n\u25a1 Are there utilization controls to prevent PPOs from making fraudulent claims or providing unnecessary services?\n\u25a1 Has credentialing been sought?\n\nCustomer service factors\n    Customer service factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 Does the sponsor help market the program to employees?\n\u25a1 Are there special program features for emergencies or information?\n\u25a1 Are the program mechanics convenient and easy for employees to use?\n\u25a1 How are problems resolved?\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 460 - Health Benefits - Funding of Health Benefits - Fully Insuring a Plan with Insurance\n\n    If a health plan fully insures, it pays a set premium amount based on the number of employees (and their spouses and dependents) who participate in the plan. This premium covers all health care costs that the plan will pay during the year based on the design of the plan.\n    If actual costs are lower than premiums. If costs are lower than the amount of the premiums, the insurance company either keeps the difference, returns some of it in the form of a dividend, or credits it against the following year's cost estimates.\n    If actual costs are higher than premiums. If actual costs are higher than the annual premiums, the insurance company is at risk and pays the difference. However, the insurer may increase premiums for the following year to make up the difference.\n\nAdvantages to employers\n    There is a great deal of security when using insurance to fully fund a plan. An employer is protected from the financial impact of catastrophic claims that exceed the budgeted premium amount.\n    This method also allows employers to budget their costs because the number of employees determines the monthly plan cost.\n    The insurance company is the claims payer and is responsible for adjudication of claims and the management of claims appeals.\n\nDisadvantages to employers\n    By using this method, however, an employer gives up any flexibility in funding benefits and has lost the use of the money (and any investment earnings on it).\n    This method also requires the payment of extra margin cost that represents the insurer's profit and marketing costs, as well as state premium taxes.\n    An employer who offers a fully insured plan may have difficulty in modifying any benefit provisions that are mandated by state insurance laws- see KB-1 Topic 640-670.\n"

This premium is determined by the HMO for the geographic area and includes all health care costs that an employer needs to pay during the year.\n   Pointer: This HMO premium also includes the costs of wellness and preven\u00ad tive medicine that HMOs often sponsor.\n   If costs are lower.

However, if the actual costs are higher than the yearly premiums, the HMO is at risk and pays the difference and may increase premiums the following year to make up the difference.\n\nAdvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, there is security in knowing what health care costs are; an employer is protected from catastrophic claims and can budget its costs.\n   The HMO usually does not require claims to be submitted, but rather simply provides the coverage for the pre-established rate.\n   HMOs offer a managed care approach to health care that may result in a lower monthly cost than other insurance arrangements.\n\nDisadvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, the employer has lost flexibility and has tied up its funds. It must also pay the HMO's margin cost that represents its profit and marketing costs.\n   The premium paid to the HMO is not based on the risk characteristics of the employer's own employee group but rather on all people in the geographic area who participate in the HMO. This is because HMOs use community rating (see KB-1 Topic 430). Premium increases for subsequent years are also based on costs incurred by the whole membership.\n"

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2215 - Health Care Spending Accounts\n\tGenerally, a health care flexible spending account (FSA) is designed to pay an employee's medical and dental expenses in pre-tax dollars. The annual deductibles for the medical and dental portions of the employer-provided health care plan, as well as expenses not covered by the plan (e.g., eye examinations, glasses, hearing aids, and orthodontia), can be reimbursed from the health care FSA\n\t2020 annual limits. Effective for tax years beginning in 2020, a health FSA will not be a qualified benefit under a cafeteria plan unless the plan provides for a $2,750 maximum salary reduction contribution to the FSA. (Reference 1 below) If the plan does allow salary reductions in excess of $2,750, then an employee will be subject to tax on distributions from the health FSA, thereby eliminating any of the tax benefits of health FSA contributions. Indexing of the annual limit applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 2013. The IRS has clarified that the term \"taxable year\" refers to the plan year of the cafeteria plan as this is the period for which salary\u00ad reduction elections are made. Furthermore, in the case of a plan providing a grace period (which may be up to two months and 15 days), unused salary-reduction contributions to the health FSA for plan years beginning in 2012 or later that are carried over into the grace period for that plan year will not count against the annual limit for the subsequent plan year. The IRS has also provided relief for certain salary-reduction contributions exceeding the annual limit that are due to a reasonable mistake and not willful neglect and that are corrected by the employer. (Reference 2 below)\n\tBenefits provided under health care FSAs are treated as \"excepted benefits\" under HIPAA-see KB-1 Topic 2226.\n\nPremiums for other health coverage\n\tA health care spending account cannot be used to pay the premiums for other health care coverage, such as an individual health plan premium, Medicare premiums, or group health insurance premiums incurred by the employee's spouse. (Reference 3 below)\n\tPointer: Although health care FSAs cannot be used to pay premiums for other health care coverage, premiums for current health plan coverage (including coverage under a health care FSA) may still be paid on a salary reduction basis through the ordinary operation of the cafeteria plan.\n\nFSA insurance features\n\tFSAs are required to incorporate features that are commonly associated with insurance arrangements, such as basic risk-shifting and risk-spreading characteristics. (Reference 4 below)\n\nReimbursement for incurred medical expenses\nReimbursements under health care FSAs must be paid specifically to reimburse the participant for medical expenses incurred previously during the period of coverage. (Reference 5 below) A health care FSA cannot operate under a cafeteria plan in a manner that enables participants to receive coverage only for periods for which the participants expect to incur medical expenses if such periods constitute less than a plan year.\n\tA reimbursement is not paid specifically to reimburse the participant for medical expenses if the participant is entitled to these amounts in the form of cash or any other taxable or nontaxable benefit, including health care coverage for an additional period, without regard to whether the employee incurs medical expenses during the period. A health care FSA cannot qualify for tax-favored treatment if the effect of the reimbursement arrangement eliminates all, or substantially all, risk of loss to the employer maintaining the plan or to the other insurer.\n\tPointer: Employers may wish to keep FSA participants informed of reimbursed expenses and account balances by issuing FSA status memos. This memo could also be used to remind participants of the deadline for submitting claims for the current year.\n \nAvailability of maximum reimbursement\n\tThe maximum amount of reimbursement elected by each participant must be available to the participant throughout the coverage period, subject to reduction for prior claims paid. (Reference 6 below) The amount of the available reimbursement cannot be based on the amount of premiums paid by the individual at the time the claim is made, nor can an employer accelerate the premium payment schedule based upon claims.\n\tReimbursement will be deemed to be available at all times: (Reference 7 below)\n\t1. if it is paid at least monthly; or\n\t2. when the total amount of the claims submitted is at least a specified minimum amount (e.g., $50).\n\tIf the employee revokes existing elections, the employer must reimburse the employee for any amount previously paid for coverage or benefits relating to the period after the date of the employee's separation from service, regardless of the employee's claims or reimbursements as of such date. (Reference 8 below)\n\tExample 1: Employee Arnold Carter elects coverage under a health care FSA providing coverage of up to $300 in medical expenses, and the annual premium for a calendar year of coverage is $300. Arnold is permitted to pay the $300 premium through salary reductions of $25 per month throughout the coverage period. He must be eligible to receive the maximum amount of reimbursement of $300 at all times throughout the coverage period (reduced by prior reimbursements).\n\tThus, if Arnold incurs $250 of medical expenses in January, the full $250 must be available for reimbursement even though he has made only one premium payment. If Arnold incurs another $50 in health expenses in February, the remaining $50 of the $300 maximum must be available for reimbursement. The employer or plan may not provide for an acceleration of the required premium payments based on Arnold's incurred claims and reimbursements.\n\tExample 2: Employee Ernie Brock elects coverage under a health care FSA with a maximum reimbursement limit of $500 for a calendar year of coverage and is required to pay the $450 premium for such coverage in two equal $225 installments, one at the beginning of the period of coverage and the second installment by the beginning of the sixth month of coverage. Ernie incurs a\n$400 medical expense in February, and the FSA makes a $400 reimbursement to the employee in March. Ernie does not incur any additional medical expenses before the end of June, at which time he separates from service.\n\tIf Ernie fails to make the second premium installment, his coverage under the FSA may be terminated as of the end of June so that medical expenses incurred after June are not covered. If Ernie pays the second premium installment, his coverage under the FSA must continue, so that additional medical expenses (up to the remaining $100) incurred before the end of December are covered.\n \nTwelve-month period of coverage\n\tA health care FSA must provide coverage for a period of 12 months, although there are exceptions for short first plan years or short plan years when the entire cafeteria plan year is being changed. (Reference 9 below) Election changes to increase or decrease the level of coverage under a health care FSA during the 12-month period of coverage are not permitted. However, a cafeteria plan may permit participants to make health care FSA election changes if there is a change in the employee's status(see KB-1 Topic 2070).\n\tEmployees who make the total premium payment for the 12-month period cannot be terminated from the health care FSA merely because they separate from service with the employer. (Reference 10 below)\n\tExample 3: Ellen Nelson has elected a $300 calendar year health care FSA, with monthly premium payments of $25 during the 12-month period of cover\u00ad age. She separates from the service of her employer at the end of June and ceases to make additional premium payments. The cafeteria plan may provide that the FSA's period of coverage does not extend beyond June if she does not continue to make the required premium payments. However, if Ellen makes the total premium payment for the 12-month period of coverage, the cafeteria plan may not terminate the FSA's period of coverage merely because she separated from service before the end of the coverage period.\n\nProhibited reimbursements\n\tReimbursements under health care FSAs must be paid specifically to reimburse medical expenses incurred during the coverage period. A health care FSA cannot reimburse participants for premiums for other health coverage. This includes premiums paid for health coverage maintained by the employer of the employee's spouse or dependent.

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - What is a Health Savings Account (HSA) and how does it work?\n\n\tHealth savings accounts are an alternative to standard group insurance plans. A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"
