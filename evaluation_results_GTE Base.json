                    "text": "KB-5 -  Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - Health Savings Accounts\n\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs)\n\n\tIn addition to providing prescription drug coverage for older Americans, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs are designed as successors to Archer MSAs, which are briefly discussed later, and the two have many features in common. However, they also have some notable differences that make HSAs more attractive than Archer MSAs and available to a much larger pool of consumers.\n\n\tHSAs were allowed as early as 2004. Various surveys indicate that by 2009 there were 6 to 7 million people with high-deductible health plans that met the criteria for them to also have HSAs. About three-quarters of these people have such health plans through employer-provided medical expense arrangements, but only about half of this group have either established HSAs or had their employers establish HSAs for them.\n\nGeneral Nature\n\n\tAn HSA is a personal savings account from which unreimbursed medical expenses, including deductibles, percentage participation, and copayments, can be paid. The HSA must be in the form of a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established in conjunction with a high-deductible health (medical expense) plan. An HSA is established with a qualified trustee or custodian in much the same way that an IRA is established. Any insurance company or bank (as well as certain other financial institutions) can be a trustee or custodian, as can any other person or entity already approved by the IRS as a trustee or custodian for IRAs.\n\n\tHSAs are individual trusts, which prohibits a husband and wife from having a joint HSA. But as long as both are eligible, each may have a separate HSA.\n\n\tSome insurers that sell high-deductible health plans for use with HSAs also market the HSA accounts; other insurers leave it to the purchasers of a high-deductible health plan to establish their HSAs with other institutions.\n\n\tEven though employers can sponsor HSAs, these accounts are established for the benefit of individuals and are portable. If an employee changes employers or leaves the workforce, the HSA, including the balance in the account, remains with the individual.\n\nEligibility\n\n\tEmployees, the self-employed, and anyone else can establish HSAs as long as they meet the following rules for qualification:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual must be covered by a high-deductible health plan. That plan may be insured or self-insured if offered by an employer as long as it meets the criteria for a qualifying high-deductible plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual is not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person's federal income tax return.\n\n\t\t\u2022 With some exceptions, a person who is covered under a high-deductible health plan is denied eligibility for an HSA if he or she is covered under another health plan that does not meet the definition of a high-deductible plan but that provides any benefits that are covered under the high-deductible health plan. The exceptions include coverage for accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care as well as liability insurance, insurance for a specified disease or illness, and insurance paying a fixed amount per period of hospitalization. Participation in a typical FSA would make an individual ineligible to participate in an HSA unless the FSA only provided reimbursement for types of expenses not covered under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\n\tAn employer can establish HSAs for its employees, or an individual (whether employed or not) may establish his or her own HSA.\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plan\n\n\tFor purposes of HSA participation, a high-deductible health plan is defined as having the following deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limitations for covered services. These figures are for 2012 and subject to annual inflation adjustments:\n\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of self-only coverage, the deductible must be at least $1,200, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $6,050.\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $12,100.\n\n\tIf these high-deductible plans use preferred-provider networks, they can have higher out-of-pocket limits for services provided outside the network, and any deductibles for nonnetwork services are not taken into account when determining the out-of-pocket limits specified above.\n\n\tOne point should be emphasized about the deductible for family coverage. It is not a family deductible as was described in the discussion on major medical insurance. In that situation, there is an individual deductible that\napplies to each family member as well as a separate deductible for the family. This is sometimes referred to as an embedded deductible, and the policy pays benefits for any family member once his or her deductible is satisfied, even if the family deductible is not yet met.\n\n\tIn the case of a high-deductible policy used with an HSA, there will usually not be an individual deductible if a policy is written for a family. Rather, there will be a single deductible-referred to as a common deductible-that must be satisfied before any benefits are payable, even if all claims are for one family member. It is permissible, however, to use an embedded deductible, but only if the individual deductible is equal to at least the required HSA family deductible of $2,400.\n\n\tThe following incurred expenses do not count toward the plan's required deductible and out-of-pocket limit:\n\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services not covered by the high-deductible health plan\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services received from nonnetwork health care providers, if the plan uses a preferred-provider network\n\t\t\u2022 amounts above a plan's reasonable allowable specific service maximums\n\t\t\u2022 amounts in excess of reasonable and customary fees \n\t\t\u2022 penalties for failure to obtain a plan-required certification\n\n\tNevertheless, copayments and required percentage participation count toward the out-of-pocket limit, even if the plan does not consider them as contributing toward the satisfaction of the deductible. In addition, the deductible amount counts towards the out-of-pocket limit. However, employee contributions paid for the coverage do not count.\n\nPreventive Care\n\n\tGenerally, a high-deductible health plan established in conjunction with an HSA cannot provide benefits before the deductible is satisfied, but there is an exception for benefits for preventive care. A high-deductible health plan may provide benefits for the following preventive care services before the insured satisfies the plan's required high deductible:\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual physicals, immunizations, and screening services\n\n\t\t\u2022 routine prenatal and well-child care\n\n\t\t\u2022 tobacco cessation programs and obesity weight-loss programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 employee-assistance, disease management, or wellness programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 treatment of a related condition that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive care service or screening, such as removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy\n\n\t\t\u2022 drugs or medications taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease before the disease manifests itself or to prevent the reoccurrence of a disease from which the person has recovered. An example is the drug treatment of high cholesterol to prevent heart disease, or the treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with medications to prevent a recurrence. Other prescription drugs that do not qualify under this exception remain subject to the plan's high deductible.\n\nPreventive care must be offered with no cost-sharing.\n\nContributions\n\n\tContributions to an HSA may be made solely by individuals who have such accounts. They may also be made by employers that provide their employees with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIndividual Contributions\n\n\tIndividuals often fund HSAs without employer contributions because they are not employees or because their employer makes no contribution to HSAs. Contributions must be in the form of cash, and they are deductible for federal income tax purposes even if the individual does not itemize deductions.\n\n\tThe maximum annual contribution to an HSA in 2012 is $3,100 if the account holder has self-only coverage and $6,250 if the account holder has family coverage. These amounts are subject to annual indexing for inflation. As a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the full maximum contribution is allowed even if it exceeds the policy deductible amount under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\tIf both a husband and wife establish an HSA and have family coverage (that is, a single policy covering both of them), they can allocate the maximum contribution in any way they determine. If they have separate policies, each is subject to the limits that apply to self-only coverage.\n\n\tIndividuals aged 55 or older are also permitted an additional annual catch-up contribution of up to $1,000. If both a husband and wife are aged 55 or older, the catch-up contribution is available to each of them only if they have separate HSAs.\n\n\tAnnual contributions can be made in a lump sum or spread out over time. However, the contributions for a specific tax year cannot be made before the tax year begins or after the taxpayer's original filing date (without extensions) for that tax year. For most individuals, this is the earlier of April 15 of the following year or the date a return is filed. This is similar to the rules for IRA contributions.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJack and Eva, a married couple, retired last year when they each reached age 56. They purchased a family medical expense policy with a $5,000 deductible, and Jack established an HSA. The maximum contribution to the HSA for 2012 is $7,250, which consists of the regular $6,250 limit and an additional catch-up amount of $1,000 for Jack.\n\n\tHowever, i\u00a3 they each established an HSA, they both would be eligible to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution to their own accounts. The$6,250 regular contribution could be allocated between the two accounts as they agree upon. The net effect is that the total HSA contributions would increase to $8,250.\n\n\tThey can make these contributions in one or more payments between January 1, 2012 and the date they file their 2012 tax return.\n\n\tIf an individual stops participating in an HSA during a tax year, the actual HSA contribution that can be deducted for the tax year is limited to 1/12 of the annual amount, as described previously, times the number of months that an individual is eligible for HSA participation. Until 2007, the same rule applied if an individual began participating in an HSA after January of the tax-year-only a proportionate contribution could be made. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act changed the rule as long as an individual is still eligible to participate in an HSA during the last month of a tax-year. In such a situation, the individual is allowed to make the full annual tax-deductible contribution for the year. However, if he or she fails to remain eligible for an HSA for at least 12 months thereafter (other than because of death or disability), the contribution for the prior year that is attributable to months when the account holder did not have an HSA is includible in gross income and subject to a 20 percent penalty tax.\n\n\tAn excess contribution occurs to the extent that contributions to an HSA exceed the tax-deductible limits or are made for an ineligible person. The account holder is subject to a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions (including those made by an employer) for each year these contributions are in an account. This excise tax can be avoided if the excess amount and any net income attributable to the excess amount are removed from the HSA prior to the last day prescribed by law, (including extensions) for filing the account holder's income tax return. The net income attributable to the excess contributions is included in the account holder's gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is made.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\tPaul, aged 55, is eligible for an HSA and has a self-only high-deductible policy. In January 2012, he made a contribution of $2,000 to the HSA. On July 1, Paul decided to cease being a self-employed freelance editor and become an employee of a magazine. He cancelled his previous medical expense policy and enrolled in his new employer's, which did not qualify as a high-deductible health plan. As a result, Paul's allowable HSA contribution for the year is only 6/12 of $3,000, or $1,500. He is now in the position of having made an excess contribution for the year. As long as he withdraws the other $500 plus any earnings on this amount before filing his 2012 tax return, he will avoid any adverse tax consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\tJane, aged 39, did just the opposite of Paul. She left her prior job with an employer and became a self-employed consultant. This occurred on November 1, 2012, when she dropped her former HMO coverage through the employer and purchased a high-deductible medical expense policy for herself and her son. She also established an HSA. She is eligible to make the full 2012 contribution of $6,250 and took it as a deduction on her 2012 tax return. However, if she does not continue to be covered under a high-deductible health plan through 2013, a portion of this amount will have to be included as taxable income for 2013.\n\nRoll-Over Contributions\n\n\tAn account balance from an Archer MSA can be rolled over to an HSA on a tax-free basis. Similarly, account balances from an existing HSA can be rolled over to a new HSA.\n\n\tThe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also allows certain other types of tax-free rollovers in specific circumstances. For example, an account holder who establishes an HSA is allowed a one-time rollover of funds from an HRA or health FSA. The amount of the rollover, which is in addition to any regular contribution for the year, is limited to the lesser of the balance in such an account on (1) September 21, 2006, or (2) the date of the rollover. If the account holder does not remain eligible to participate in an HSA for at least one year after the rollover, the amount of the rollover is included in income for tax purposes and subject to a penalty tax. Finally, an account holder may make a one-time-only rollover from an IRA. The amount of the rollover is limited to the tax-deductible HSA contribution for the year and reduces any regular contribution allowed.\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\n\tMany persons with HDHPs have their coverage under an employer-provided plan, and their employer may make contributions to the HSAs of employees. Employer contributions belong to the employee and are nonforfeitable. The employer might make the maximum annual contribution as previously described. However, it is also possible that the employer contribution will contribute a lower amount. In this case, an employee can make any remaining allowable contribution.\n\n\tAn employer that contributes to HSAs is subject to a nondiscrimination rule that requires the employer to make comparable contributions for all employees who have HSAs. Failure to comply with this rule subjects the employer to an excise tax. However, full-time employees and part-time employees (those working fewer than 30 hours per week) are treated separately. The comparability rule generally requires that the employer contribute either the same dollar amount for each employee or the same percentage of each employee's deductible under the health plan. However, it is permissible for an employer to make larger contributions for nonhighly-compensated employees than for highly compensated employees.\n\nHSA Account Growth\n\n\tUnused amounts in an HSA accumulate on a tax-free basis and carry over to subsequent years without limit. The size of an HSA balance carried over from prior years has no effect on a current year's contribution.\n\nDistributions from an HSA\n\n\tAn individual can usually take distributions from an HSA at any time, but the trust or custodial document may put reasonable restrictions on both the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. Generally, accounts are set up so that they can be accessed with debit cards or checks written by the account holder as an alternative to actually filing for reimbursement. The amount of the distribution can be any part or all of the account balance. Subject to some exceptions, distributions of both contributions and earnings are excludible from an account holder's gross income if used to pay medical expenses of the account holder and the account holder's legal spouse and tax dependents as long as these expenses are not paid by other sources of insurance. There is no requirement that these family members be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. If both a husband and wife have HSAs, the reimbursement for any family can come from either or both HSAs but together cannot exceed the amount of the unreimbursed expense.\n\n\tFor the most part, the eligible medical expenses are the same ones that would be deductible, ignoring the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation (10 percent in 2013), if the account holder itemized his or her income tax deductions. Tax-free withdrawals are permitted for the purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for the purchase of health coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation. They are also permitted for the purchase of long-term care insurance up to certain deductible limits. However, tax-free withdrawals are not otherwise permitted for the purchase of health insurance by persons under age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tEric has accumulated $6,000 in his HSA account during the last 3 years. Because hjs wife has medical expense coverage with her employer, Eric's high-deductible policy is for him only.\n\n\tIn February, Eric incurred his first medical expenses for the year when he severely sprained his wrist. He incurred $1,000 in medical expenses that were not covered under his policy because the $5,000 deductible had not been met. Eric can pay for these expenses with funds from his HSA.\n\n\tIn April, Eric had a routine eye examination that cost $120. This examination was not covered under his medical expense policy, but it qualifies as a medical expense for IRS purposes. Therefore, Eric can take a $120 tax-free distribution from his HSA.\n\n\tIn July, Eric's wife had a crown installed by her dentist. Her employer-provided health insurance paid only $600 of the dentist's bill. Eric can use his HSA to pay the remaining $400 because HSA funds can be used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses of an account holder's legal spouse. (Note that the IRS considers medical expenses to include charges for dental services.)\n\n\n\tEven though contributions cannot be made after an individual reaches age 65 and becomes a Medicare beneficiary, tax-free distributions can still be used for any future qualified medical expenses, which include premiums for original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage plans, and medical expense coverage under employer-sponsored plans. However, an account holder cannot use tax-free distributions to pay premiums for a Medicare supplement policy.\n\n\tFrom a financial planning standpoint, account holders may want to wait until after retirement or age 65 to take HSA distributions as long as they have the resources to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses prior to that time. This will allow their HSA balances to grow on a tax-favored basis for use in their older years when unreimbursed medical expenses may be higher and/or income may be lower.\n\n\tDistributions are permitted for other reasons, but they are subject to income taxation and possibly to a 20 percent penalty tax. However, the penalty tax does not apply in the case of distributions after an individual's death, disability, or the attainment of age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKirby has a balance of $7,000 in his HSA. At age 67, he rediscovered his childhood sweetheart and fell madly in love. She agreed to marry him and he wants to give her a big diamond ring. Because she told Kirby that she would take care of him for life, he decided to cash in his HSA and apply the proceeds to purchase the ring. His tax accountant informed Kirby that this arrangement would not be a qualified medical expense. He can withdraw the funds without penalty because he is at least age 65, but the $7,000 must be included in his gross income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\n\tFormer employees, including retirees, may continue HSAs that were established prior to termination of employment, and the rules for contributions and distributions are as previously described.\n\n\tRetirees who did not have an HSA prior to retirement can establish one at that time as long as all the proper rules are satisfied. Such an HSA may present an opportunity for a retiree to reduce income taxes. However, the requirement of having a high-deductible plan will probably negate this advantage if an individual has substantial medical expenses.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKathleen, a widow, retired at age 60 from her job as an attorney. She likes the concept of consumer-directed health plans and has decided to establish an HSA. In order to be eligible for the HSA, she purchased a major medical policy with an annual deductible of $2,500. She plans to make the maximum allowable contribution to the HSA until she is eligible for Medicare. She will then use her HSA balance to pay her Medicare premiums.\n\n\tThere are fees involved in establishing an HSA. These fees may affect any potential tax advantages if an HSA is established near the time of Medicare enrollment.\n\nEstate Tax Treatment of HSAs\n\n\tUpon death, the remaining balance in an HSA is includible in the account holder's gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the account is a surviving spouse, the HSA belongs to the spouse and he or she can deduct the account balance in determining the account holder's taxable estate. The surviving spouse can then use the HSA for his or her medical expenses. If the beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, the HSA ceases to exist, and the beneficiary must include the fair market value of the account in his or her gross income for tax purposes. If no beneficiary is named, the tax is payable by the estate or the beneficiary of the estate.\n\nEstablishing and Maintaining HSAs\n\n\tThere are a number of issues that need to be evaluated by an individual who has the option to establish an HSA. Perhaps the most important question is whether such an account is appropriate. After a person decides to establish an HSA, issues such as account fees, investment options for funds, and record keeping must be addressed.\n\nAppropriateness of HSAs\n\n\tFor some persons, an HSA is very appropriate and offers significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities. For other persons, an HSA may not be an attractive financial commitment. An HSA's viability depends on individual circumstances such as income, tax rates, the funds available to fund such an account, when account balance will be withdrawn, earnings on account funds, and account fees. Some of these issues are addressed in the following example.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJohn and his wife, both aged 50, no longer have any dependent children. They are self-employed and have a joint income of $150,000. For the last few years, they have had an HSA-compatible policy with a $5,000 deductible, but have not established HSAs. They are in good health and have paid aU unreimbursed medical expenses from current income. Their financial advisor has suggested that one or both of them should establish an HSA. They have decided to do so, and make an annual contribution of $5,000, which is an affordable financial commitment. This will result in an annual income tax savings of $1,300 (based on IRS estimates). They have also decided to continue paying any unreimbursed medical expenses from current income and to let the HSA funds accumulate until they retire at age 65. They plan on investing the funds and expect them to grow at about 5 percent per year. If this return is achieved, they will have a fund of about $100,000 when they retire. They will then withdraw amounts as needed on a tax-free basis to pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nAccount Fees\n\n\tOne factor that varies widely among financial institutions that offer HSAs is the fees that they charge. If an individual uses an HSA that has been established by his or her employer, the employer may pay some of these fees. But no matter how an account is established, a potential account holder should look at the fees and their impact on the account balance. Unfortunately, this is not always easy to do. Although financial institutions often have information about their HSAs on Web sites or in print, the fee structure is often conspicuously absent or hard to locate. Unlike other types of financial products, such as IRAs, there are no requirements to provide potential account holders with\na prospectus that details the fees. Therefore, it is often necessary to ask specific questions. As the next example demonstrates, these fees may have an effect on the decision to establish an HSA. Even if an HSA is an obvious choice, the account balance will be affected by the fee structure.\n\n\tHSA fees fall into several categories that might include one or more of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 account setup fee. This is a one-time fee to establish the HSA. Such fees typically range from $0 to $50, with $15 or $20 being common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual fee. An HSA may have an annual fee that ranges up to $200, but amounts of $10 to $20 are most common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 monthly maintenance fee. An HSA may have a monthly maintenance fee that ranges up to $10, but amounts like $2 to $3 seem most common. Although there may be both a monthly maintenance fee and an annual fee, this is very uncommon; there is usually one or the other. In either case, the amount of the fee may be lower for higher account balances.\n\n\t\t\u2022 transaction fee. An HSA may have a fee that is levied on each transaction. The fee may apply to contributions, but is most likely to be levied on withdrawals only. Fees may be as high as $5, but $.25 to $.50 are quite common. Sometimes a few transactions are allowed without a fee, but fees are levied on transactions in excess of this number.\n\n\t\t\u2022 account closing fee. It is not unusual for an HSA to have an account closing fee that can range up to $25 or $30, although $10 is a more common amount.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tAmber is an administrative assistant who earns about $40,000 annually. She has an employer-provided medical expense policy with a $2,500 deductible. Her employer has not set up HSAs for employees and makes no HSA contributions. Amber enjoys traveling and what money she has left is being saved for a new car that she hopes to buy within the next 2 years. Amber is healthy and incurs about $500 in unreimbursed medical expenses annually. This typically includes two doctor's visits and quarterly refills of a prescription drug. To minimize her taxes, Amber decides toestablish an HSA. She plans on putting the $500 into an HSA account and taking a withdrawal each time she incurs an unreimbursed medical expense. This will lower her taxes by about $75. When she looks into establishing such an account with her local bank, she finds that they have an account setup fee of $15. There is also a $2 monthly maintenance fee ($24 per year) and a $3 fee for each withdrawal ($18 for her six transactions). Therefore, she will incur expenses of $57 to save $75 the first year. When Amber finds out that her account balance will be too small to earn more than 1 percent interest, she decides that an HSA is not worth the administrative hassle for such a minimal tax savings.\n\nInvestment Options for HSA Funds\n\n\tFinancial institutions often offer several types of investment options for HSA funds. Account holders can invest HSA funds in essentially the same manner as IRA funds. Allowable investments include bank accounts, annuities, certificates of deposit, stocks, mutual funds, and bonds. Investments in life insurance policies or most types of collectibles are prohibited. In addition, an HSA trust or custodial agreement may limit the investment options available.\n\n\tAlthough mutual funds and stocks may result in the best return over a number of years, they are probably unsuitable if an account holder has modest amounts in an HSA that will be used for medical expenses in the near future. Like many types of investments, they will fluctuate in value over time. Such investments may also be unavailable unless an account holder has an account balance of several thousand dollars. The prior example regarding John under the heading Appropriateness shows when such an investment makes sense.\n\n\tIn most cases, an individual will be using some type of bank account that allows easy access to the available funds. In this case, it is important to evaluate the return that these funds will earn, which is set by each bank. In some cases, nothing is paid unless the account exceeds a minimum balance, such as $1,000. Interest rates may also vary by the size of the account's average daily balance. In still other cases, a specified interest rate, which can change, is paid on any size balance. Even with these variations, there are significant differences among banks.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\tCustodians and trustees for HSAs report the amount of annual contributions to and distributions from each HSA to the IRS. Under IRS rules, it is the account holder's responsibility to determine whether distributions from HSAs are for eligible medical expenses. Therefore, individuals who establish such accounts should maintain records in case they are audited. They should also become familiar with the types of expenses that are deductible. Guidance can be found in IRS Publication 502, which is available on the IRS Web site: irs.gov."

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 470 - Health Benefits - Funding of Health Benefits - Partially Insuring a Plan with Stop-Loss Insurance\n   Stop-loss insurance is a form of insurance that protects employers that self insure or self fund their health plans from the financial impact of catastrophically large claims. In general, these plans enter into a contract with an insurance carrier to provide insurance coverage in the event that claims exceed a specified dollar amount over a predetermined period of time, usually a plan year.\n   Pointer: The benefits of a stop-loss policy are payable to the employer, rather than to the plan.\n\nTypes of coverage\n   Generally, there are two types of stop-loss coverage:\n1. specific (coverage pays when any individual in the plan has claims over a specified amount during one plan year); and\n2. aggregate (coverage pays after total plan claims exceed a dollar limit for a plan year).\n   The essence of stop-loss coverage is protection of self-insured plans against a claim for a catastrophic illness or injury, such as cancer, spinal cord injury, bypass surgery, delivery of a premature infant, or AIDS. Without stop-loss coverage, a single claim could jeopardize the financial integrity of an employer's self-insured plan.\n   Pointer: Stop-loss insurance is relatively inexpensive (generally up to five percent of claims).\n\nPooling or attachment point\n   When purchasing stop-loss coverage on either a specific or aggregate basis, the employer and the insurer determine a dollar limit beyond which the stop-loss insurance begins to pay benefits. This is known as the pooling point or the attachment point. Benefit payments beyond the dollar limit are paid from a pool or group of shared risks, usually administered and underwritten by an insurance company.\n   The pooling point for specific stop-loss varies among employers and depends on their individual level of comfort with risk and the cost of coverage.\n   Pointer: Employers using aggregate stop-loss insurance usually pick a point that is 120 to 125 percent of expected incurred claims. For specific stop-loss coverage, there is no set standard-the pooling point is based on the em\u00ad ployer's acceptance of risk.\n\nPurchasing stop-loss coverage\n   Stop-loss coverage may be purchased from an insurance carrier, a specialty carrier, a third-party administrator, or a reinsurer or syndicate.\n   Data on plan benefits, recent plan claims experience, and a census of employ\u00ad ees and dependents including COBRA participants, disabled or other special em\u00ad ployees, and retirees is needed to market the coverage. In addition, the employer must specify the following information:\n\u25a1 attachment or pooling point;\n\u25a1 benefits that are considered for aggregate coverage, for exam\u00ad ple, medical only, or medical, dental, prescription drug, and disability; and\n\u25a1 basis of coverage including the number of months for paid claims or run-in and any maximum on run-in.\n   Pointer: Generally, stop-loss carriers expect a high level of participation by employees-for example, at least 75 percent of those eligible should be covered.\n"

We call this an \"actuarial\" methodology because it uses trend to adjust an historic period's experience and compares it with that of the intervention period. An example of an application of this methodology is provided below.\n\nExample of a Savings Calculation\n\tIn this example, we apply the data assembled in Table 6-3. The calculation is shown in Table 6-4.

Assuming that the underlying cost of a Medicare population ranges between $6,000 and $8,000 per member per year, for 150,000 members,\n\nTABLE\t6-4\nExample of a Savings Calculation\n\nEstimated Savings due to Averted Admissions=\nBaseline Admissions/1,000 x Utilization Trend\t600.0 X 1.053 = 631.8\nMinus:\tActual Admissions/1,000/year\t576.0\nEquals:\tReduced Admissions/1,000/year\t55.8\nMultiplied by:\tActual member years in measurement period/1000\t50.0\nEquals:\tTotal reduced admissions\t2,790.0\nMultiplied by:\tTrended unit cost/admission\t$..8..Q.QQ\nEquals:\tEstimated Savings due to Averted Admissions\t$22,320,000\n\nthe total population cost will be $900,000,000 to $1.2 billion. While estimated savings of $22.3 million from a program in the chronic population may seem high in absolute terms, relative to the total cost of the Medicare population, the savings represent 1.9 percent to 2.5 percent, which is consistent with results from other studies of this type.\n\tPlausibility, a method that is widely used as a check on the results of a savings calculation, is discussed later in the chapter.\n\nThe Importance of Trend\n\tThe importance of trend in the calculation should be obvious from the above example. A small change in the measured (or assumed) trend can have a significant effect on the estimated savings. Trend is the rate of increase in per-member per-month cost, or the difference between year two and year one costs per member per month, divided by year-one cost per member per month. Trend may be defined on a calendar-year or on any 12-month basis, and, with appropriate adjustment, may be annualized to a 12-month period.\n\tA study that compares observed trends in commercial chronic and nonchronic populations by Bachler, Duncan, and Juster (Reference 7 below) found that, under some chronic identification methodologies, a \"migration bias\" may be present that results in lower trend being observed in the chronic population than either the nonchronic population or the overall population. Therefore, adjustment of historical observed claims per member per month by nonchronic or population savings could result in an upward bias in the estimated savings. The authors found that one way to avoid this bias is to retroactively identify the chronic population (i.e., all members who ever meet the chronic criteria are included in the chronic population from the beginning of the study). Other potential corrections identified by the authors are the application of requalification (i.e., members who do not continue to meet qualifying criteria on an annual basis are eliminated from the chronic population) and a risk score adjustment.\n\nSize of Population and Credibility\nAs programs have been applied to conditions with smaller prevalence, and to smaller employer populations, the issue of population and credibility of outcomes has become more prominent. A paper by Farah and others (Reference 8 below) provides guidance in terms of the credibility of the outcomes of different size populations. Only the largest employer populations are of a sufficient size that their financial results can be considered credible without adjustment. Financial results of smaller employers are unlikely to be credible, but if utilization outcomes are measured, results of smaller employer populations may be credible. Appendix 6.1 contains examples of relative group size requirements for financial and utilization credibility.\n\nValidation of Savings Calculations\n\tIn addition to the obvious validation of the data by tying claims and membership to a reliable source, the actuary may wish to review utilization data to ensure that these are trending in line with the calculated savings. For example, because disease management achieves its effect through reductions in hospitalizations and specialist visits, while increasing drug and primary care provider utilization, changes in utilization measures should be consistent with this pattern. A related technique that has achieved prominence is the use of plausibility analysis. This technique essentially tracks changes in utilization between the pre- and post-period of a program, comparing the measured (dollar) savings with the savings implied by reduction in utilization.\n\tPlausibility analysis requires the calculation of the following statistic (the plausibility factor) for the entire health plan:\n\n1 _ Disease-specific admissions/1,000 (program year) Disease-specific admissions/1,000 (baseline year)\n\n\tA small positive value of the plausibility statistic implies that there has been an overall reduction in admissions. This reduction should be consistent with the claimed (dollar) savings from the program. We can apply this technique to the data in Table 6-4.\n\nPlausibility factor = (1-\t576) = 0.04\n600\n\n\tIf a vendor had claimed savings of $22.3 million without supporting evidence, a quick calculation of the plausibility factor would demonstrate that indeed a positive reduction in admissions had occurred.\n\tThe use and the limitations of utilization-based measures, however, need to be clearly understood. Plausibility factors, being utilization based, are a special case of the more general example of causality demonstration using changes in utilization. They deserve closer scrutiny, however, because they are being promoted, and are becoming accepted, as demonstrating validity. However, the factors themselves have never been subjected to the type of scrutiny that has been applied to calculation methodologies.\n\nUse of Plausibility Factors\n\tThe theory of plausibility factors use is that they independently validate the measured financial results of a savings calculation by demonstrating that utilization is reduced by the intervention, consistent with the financial measurement. Plausibility factors generally are utilization rates per 1,000 of the overall population for hospital admissions and emergency room visits for the primary diagnoses that are targeted by the program. The proposed interpretation of the plausibility measures is that if the savings calculation results in positive savings but the utilization-based measures do not, the savings are not validated. Rather than reconciling the two contradictory results, the plausibility factors are so dispositive that their results always trump any other outcomes calculation.\n\nHow Valid Is the Utilization-based Calculation?\n\tIn order to be a valid test of the outcomes of a savings calculation, utilization-based measures must be calculated on the same basis as the savings. With plausibility factors, this is not the case. The plausibility factors are a poor validator for the following reasons:\n1. In a disease management evaluation, the measurement population is carefully constructed to consist of members with sufficient eligibility to be enrolled and managed by the program and to exclude members and conditions that may confound the calculation. As calculated, the plausibility factors bear only a tenuous relationship to the population being managed and measured. Their use implicitly assumes comparability between populations, but this comparability is not demonstrated.\n2. Because they apply to admissions and ER visits for primary diagnoses only, plausibility factors represent a very small percentage of all admissions and costs for chronic patients. For example, within a commercial population, these admissions and ER visits only account for 3 percent of the total claims costs for members with diabetes and the admissions only account for approximately 7 percent of inpatient spend. Even a very successful program that avoided 25 percent of diabetes admissions could never demonstrate enough savings to justify program costs under this methodology. Therefore, by definition, purchasers must be assuming that the program beneficially affects other utilization measures of the population. So failure to demonstrate reduction in the direct utilization measures does not necessarily imply lack of success with other types of utilization.\n3. Plausibility factors do not take account of the risk profile of a population. For example, it is entirely possible that from one year to the next a new group of relatively high-risk members may replace a relatively low-risk group, increasing the measured chronic admission rate per 1,000.\n4. The plausibility factors take no account of volatility in admission rates.\n5. The plausibility factors, unlike the underlying adjusted historical control methodology, take no account of underlying trends in the population. While admission trends are low (lower than overall trend), they are still nonzero. To understand this point, consider Table 6-5, which reports the actual discharges per 1,000 for selected chronic conditions for Medicare patients between 1998 and 2007. Over the nine-year period, the average trend in admissions for all chronic conditions except renal failure and syncope is negative. Trends in individual years deviated from the average, increasing in the early part of the 21st century, indicating the volatility in admission rates per 1,000.\n\n\tFigure 6-6 illustrates the important point that the underlying discharge trend present in the population (which may well be negative) will need to be taken into consideration in plausibility analysis. However, much as the program sponsor may wish to avoid the issue of trend, as with the adjusted historical control method, plausibility analysis requires consideration of and adjustment for trend.\n\nTABLE\t6-5\nMedicare Discharges per 1,000 by Condition\n\n(DRG)\t294\t316\t096\t088\t132-144\t141-142\n\nYear\t\nDiabetes\tRenal Failure\tBronchitis and Asthma\t\nCOPD\t\nHeart\t\nSyncope\n1998\t2.214\t2.455\t1.597\t10.254\t17.954\t3.283\n1999\t2.187\t2.566\t1.773\t10.617\t17.738\t3.367\n2000\t2.280\t2.768\t1.470\t9.925\t18.744\t3.608\n2001\t2.458\t3.001\t1.352\t10.047\t19.949\t3.915\n2002\t2.516\t3.174\t1.428\t10.275\t19.682\t4.089\n2003\t2.450\t3.984\t1.385\t10.335\t18.706\t4.259\n2004\t2.425\t4.498\t1.276\t9.564\t19.320\t4.230\n2006*\t2.267\t5.632\t1.217\t8.878\t15.976\t4.001\n2007t\t2.172\t6.105\t1.128\t8.295\t15.270\tn/a\nAnnualized Trend\t-0.2%\t10.7%\t-3.8%\t-2.3%\t-1.8%\t2.5%\nSource: Medicare and Medicaid Statistical Supplements, various years.

Essentially, pharmaceutical pricing is based on the supply chain where manufacturers sell to wholesalers and distributors who, in turn, sell to pharmacies, hospitals, physicians, and other end users. The various prices involved in the supply chain are detailed below. Health plan pricing is commonly based on the average wholesale price, but a recent court case that was decided against the publishers of the AWP has changed the marketplace to favor contracts based on wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). WAC pricing contracts are expected to replace AWP-based contracts in 2011 and 2012 agreements.\n\nAVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE\n\n\tThe AWP of a medication is the price assigned by the drug manufacturer. This price is used as a reference price for all discounts paid to pharmacies and PBMs. PBM contracts usually refer to the price that will be paid to pharmacies as a discount off the average wholesale price for a branded medication. It is important to understand that the average wholesale price may have no direct relationship to the actual cost of providing the medication. However, public and private contracts include the AWP as a reference for pricing guarantees.\n\n\tThe WAC is the list price for wholesalers, distributors and other direct accounts before any rebates, discounts, allowances or other price concessions that might be offered by the supplier of the product. The WAC is what the wholesaler buys the drugs for from the manufacturer.\n\n\t\tIn the USA, the wholesaler industry is a concentrated market dominated by five firms. Wholesalers act as distributors, buying pharmaceuticals from manufacturers at the average manufacturer price, (which is equal to the WAC), and then selling them on to pharmacies using a \"cost-plus\" approach (plus a mark-up percentage) or a \"list less\" (less a discount percentage) approach.(Reference 7 below)\n\n\tOn March 17, 2009, the United States District Court in Massachusetts entered the Final Order and Judgment approving a class action settlement in two cases-one involving First DataBank (FDB) and one involving Medi-Span. FDB is the most widely used publisher of prescription drug prices in the United States and Medi-Span is a provider of electronic drug data to health care professionals. Beginning September 26, 2009, the AWP of over 400 brand name drugs will decrease as a result of these two lawsuits.\n\nNew England Carpenters Health Benefits Fund, et al. v. First DataBank, Inc. and McKession Corp.\n\n\tIn 2005, a class-action lawsuit was brought against FDB and McKesson Corporation by New England Carpenters Health Benefits Fund, et al., a third-party payor class. McKesson Corp. is one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in the nation. The plantiffs accused FDB and McKesson Corp. of artificially inflating the AWP of over four hundred brand name drugs by 5 percent for drugs purchased from August 1, 2001 through March 15, 2005. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants inflated the AWP while keeping the WAC the same so that large retail chains and other pharmacies, many of whom were customers of McKesson, received larger profits on those drugs. As a result, many drug purchasers were overpaying for these drugs. These mark-ups were not noticed for many years because the derivation of WAC and AWP is not subject to regulatory review.\n\nDistrict Council 37 Health & Security Plan v. Medi-Span, a division of Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.\n\n\tThere was a related lawsuit against Medi-Span which published its AWP for prescription drugs based on data provided to it by FDB from December 2001 to April 2004. As a result, the lawsuit claims that the AWP published by Medi-Span was also illicitly inflated.\n\n\tIndependent of the settlement, FDB and Medi-Span have voluntarily offered to discontinue publishing AWP data within the next two years. Both companies will continue to publish other drug pricing data information to facilitate the establishment of a drug pricing benchmark. A source of concern throughout the industry is that there is no standard to take the place of using AWP as a pricing benchmark.(Reference 8 below)\n\nMAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST\n\n\tThe maximum allowable cost of a generic medication places a ceiling on the reimbursement for generics. The genesis of the MAC concept is in the federal Medicaid program. CMS publishes a federal upper limit (FUL) price for all generic medications paid in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Unfortunately, not all therapeutic categories of medications are covered on the FUL, nor is it updated as frequently as manufacturers change prices. As a result, health plans, PBMs, and TPAs developed their own MAC lists to cover all generic medications. Since generics are made by many manufacturers, several options are used for pricing the MAC. It may be the average cost of all manufacturers' average wholesale prices, or the lowest average wholesale price, or a formula for arriving at an aggregate average wholesale price discount for the entire MAC list. Most plans offer payers a MAC list that will deliver a 50 percent or more discount off the average wholesale price. As a reference price for generics, the MAC is referred to in PBM contracts, but it may or may not apply to all generic claims. The MAC may be quoted as an \"average\" or as a range of discounts.\n\nAVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE\n\n\tThe average manufacturer price (AMP) is the \"average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade, after deducting customary prompt payment discounts.\"(Reference 9 below) The AMP was originally designed as a basis for rebates paid to the states. It is now being expanded as the basis for payments of drugs to pharmacies under the Medicare Part D program. It will eventually replace AWP as the basis for retail pharmacy payments.\n\nAVERAGE SALES PRICE\n\n\tAverage sales price (ASP) is a manufacturer's average price to all purchasers, net of discounts, rebates, chargebacks, and credits for drugs. ASP is determined using manufacturers' sales reports, which include information on total units sold and total revenue for each drug. ASP is commonly used for payment of Medicare Part B drugs and is subject to audit by Medicare. In other words, the average sales price is a reference price based on purchase price rather than drug cost. The ASP price is used for Medicare reimbursements to providers.\n\nWIDELY AVAILABLE MARKET PRICE\n\n\tSections 1847A(d)(l) and (2) of the Social Security Act (the Act), as added by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), P.L. No. 108-173, directs the Office of Inspector General (OIG) to undertake pricing studies that compare ASPs to widely available market prices and AMP. Section 1847A(d)(5)(A) of the Act defines the widely available market price (WAMP) to be the price that a prudent physician or supplier would pay for the drug, net of any routinely available price concessions. In determining widely available market prices, OIG is authorized to consider information from sources including (but not limited to) manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, physicians, and suppliers.\n\n340B PRICING\n\n\tThe 340B Drug Pricing Program resulted from enactment of Public Law 102-585, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, which is codified as Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act. Section 340B limits the cost of covered outpatient drugs to certain federal grantees, federally qualified health center look-alikes and qualified disproportionate share hospitals. Significant savings on pharmaceuticals may be seen by those entities that participate in this program.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n7. www.doh.gov.uk/generics/oxera_report_a7.htm\n8.

This premium is determined by the HMO for the geographic area and includes all health care costs that an employer needs to pay during the year.\n   Pointer: This HMO premium also includes the costs of wellness and preven\u00ad tive medicine that HMOs often sponsor.\n   If costs are lower. If the actual costs are lower than the premiums, the HMO keeps the difference.\n   If costs are higher. However, if the actual costs are higher than the yearly premiums, the HMO is at risk and pays the difference and may increase premiums the following year to make up the difference.\n\nAdvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, there is security in knowing what health care costs are; an employer is protected from catastrophic claims and can budget its costs.\n   The HMO usually does not require claims to be submitted, but rather simply provides the coverage for the pre-established rate.\n   HMOs offer a managed care approach to health care that may result in a lower monthly cost than other insurance arrangements.\n\nDisadvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, the employer has lost flexibility and has tied up its funds. It must also pay the HMO's margin cost that represents its profit and marketing costs.\n   The premium paid to the HMO is not based on the risk characteristics of the employer's own employee group but rather on all people in the geographic area who participate in the HMO. This is because HMOs use community rating (see KB-1 Topic 430). Premium increases for subsequent years are also based on costs incurred by the whole membership.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 22 - Social Insurance Programs - Workers' Compensation - Appendix 22.1 Calculating Insurance Premiums\n\nCALCULATING INSURANCE PREMIUMS\n\n\tWorkers' compensation insurance premiums are determined by a multi\u00adstep process. Table A22.l-1 shows the \"traditional\" procedure used in states that rely on the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) for actuarial assistance.(Reference 31 below) The following discussion indicates some of the recent changes in the process.(Reference 32 below)\n\n\tEach employer who purchases insurance is assigned to a particular insurance classification (e.g., a bakery is assigned to class 2003). The first step shown in Table A22.l-1 is to determine the initial insurance rate by looking in an insurance manual that specifies the \"manual rate\" for each insurance classification.\n\n\tManual rates have two components: pure premiums and an expense loading. The pure premiums cover expected payments for cash benefits, medical care, and (in most jurisdictions) loss-adjustment expenses. The expense-loading factor provides an allowance for other insurance carrier expenses, such as general administrative expenses, taxes, licenses, fees, commissions, profits, and contingencies. In most states using manual rates, the loading factor is usually 35 to 40 percent of the manual rates.\n\n\tManual rates are specified as dollars per hundred dollars of payroll. The manual rates vary substantially within each state, reflecting the previous experience with benefit payments for all the employers in that classification. Manual rates in a particular state might range from $40 per $100 of payroll for logging to $0.75 per $100 of payroll for clerical workers.\n\n\tManual rates (line 1) multiplied by the employer's total payroll (line 2) equals manual premium without constants (line 3). In practice, few employers pay such a premium, because of several modifications. The first modification arises from the firm-level experience rating that is permitted for medium and large employers. Experience rating uses the employer's\n\nT A B L E\tA22.1-1\n\nCalculation of Net Workers' Compensation Costs to Policyholders\n\n1.\t\tManual rates (MR)\n2.\tX\tPayroll\n3.\t=\tManual premium without constants\n4.\tX\tExperience-rating modification\n5.\t=\tStandard earned premium excluding constants\n6.\t+\tAdjustment for expense constants\n7.\t=\tStandard earned premium at bureau rates (DSR)\n8.\tX\tAdjustment for deviations\n9.\t=\tStandard earned premium at company level\n10.\tX\tAdjustment for premium discounts, retrospective rating, and schedule rating\n11.\t=\tNet earned premium\n12.\tX\tDividends adjustment\n13.\t=\tNet cost to policyholders\n\nSource: Based on Thomason, Schmidle, and Burton (2001, Table C.5).\n\nown past record of benefit payments to modify the manual rates that would otherwise apply. If, for example, the employer's record is worse than the experience of the average employer in its classification, then its actual premium for the current policy period is larger than its manual premium. The product of the manual premium without constants (line 3) and the experience-rating modification (line 4) is line 5, the standard earned premium excluding constants.\n\n\tThe standard earned premium excluding constants is also modified for most employers, although the form of this modification depends on the size of the employer's premium. Employers in almost every state are assessed a flat charge, termed an \"expense constant,\" to cover the minimum costs of issuing and servicing a policy. In addition, prior to recent years, employers in some states were assessed another flat charge, termed a \"loss constant,\" because of the generally inferior safety record of small businesses. When the standard earned premium excluding constants (line 5) is divided by line 6, the adjustment for the expense constants), the result is the standard earned premium at bureau rates (DSR) (line 7), also termed the \"standard earned premium at the designated statistical reporting (DSR) level.\"\n\n\tThe standard earned premium at bureau rates is further adjusted for many employers. Deviations are a competitive pricing device that has been in active use in many jurisdictions since the 1980s. In a state allowing deviations, individual carriers may use the manual rates promulgated by the rating organization or may deviate from those rates. The carrier might, for example, use manual rates that are 10 percent less than those issued by the rating organization. The deviations offered by a particular carrier must be uniform for all policyholders in the state in a particular insurance class (although different deviations for different classes are sometimes possible). If the standard earned premium at bureau rates (line 7) is multiplied by the adjustment for deviations (line 8), the result is the standard earned premium at company level (line 9).\n\n\tThere are several additional factors that may reduce workers' compensation insurance premiums. Premium discounts apply to employers with annual premiums in excess of a specified amount ($5,000 was a typical figure in the 1980s, while $10,000 is now used in most NCCI states), which basically reflect reductions in carrier expenses for larger policies because of economies of scale. The discounts based on a specified schedule are compulsory in the NCCI states, unless both the insurance carrier and the employer agree to substitute \"retrospective rating\" for the premium discounts. Although these retrospective rating plans vary among the NCCI states, they are basically similar in that they allow the employer to increase the effect of its own claims experience on the published manual rates.\n\n\tThe main difference between experience rating and retrospective rating is that the former uses the employer's experience from previous periods to modify the premium for the current policy period rate, whereas the retrospective plan uses experience from the current policy period to determine the current premium on an ex post facto basis. The same expense gradation (reduction in premiums for the employer) provided by the premium discount is built into the retrospective rating plans.\n\n\tSchedule-rating plans have also been actively used in many jurisdictions since the 1980s. Under these plans, insurers can change (usually decrease) the insurance rate the employer would otherwise pay through debits or credits based on a subjective evaluation of factors such as the employer's loss-control program. There are two types of schedule rating. In states with uniform schedule-rating plans, regulators authorize all carriers to use identical schedule-rating plans. If all carriers are not given this permission, then individual carriers can apply for approval of their own schedule-rating plans.\n\n\tThe result of multiplying the standard earned premium at company level (line 9) by the adjustment for premium discounts, retrospective rating, and schedule rating (line 10) is the net earned premium (line 11). One final adjustment factor, a policyholder dividends adjustment (line 12), needs to be used to compute the premiums actually paid by employ\u00ad ers. Mutual companies or stock companies with participating policies write a substantial portion of the workers' compensation insurance. While these companies normally use a quantity discount schedule less steeply graded than that of the nonparticipating stock companies, they pay dividends that usually decrease policyholders' net costs to levels below that charged by nonparticipating stock companies, especially for large employers. The product of the net earned premium (line 11) and the dividends adjustment is the net cost to policyholders (line 13), which is the premium actually paid by employers purchasing workers' compensation insurance.\n\n\tAs complicated as the process in Table A22.1-l appears, there are actually additional charges that many if not most employers are assessed in determining their premiums. For example, an employer with a limited payroll may be required to make an additional payment in order to achieve a minimum amount of standard earned premium at step 5 of the process. And, depending on the state, there may be surcharges for the uninsured employers' fund, for terrorism, for catastrophes, for the second injury fund, and for the operating expenses of the state's workers' compensation agency.\n\n\tThe multistep process summarized in Table A22.l-1 is also inapplicable under several circumstances. First, in a number of states, the starting point for calculating the employer's premium is pure premium rates (or loss costs), rather than manual rates.(References 33 below) In these states, carriers add their own expense loadings to cover expenses, such as administrative expenses and commissions, rather than relying on the expense loadings built into manual rates.\n\n\tSecond, most workers' compensation insurance is provided in the voluntary insurance market. However, because the employers who cannot purchase policies in the voluntary market must still have insurance, all states that do not have state funds have established assigned-risk plans.(References 34 below) The national average for the assigned-risk (or residual) market share in NCCI states ranged between 3.2 percent and 28.5 percent between 1975 and 2004. Recently, the share has declined from 12.7 percent in 2004 to 6.2 percent in 2008.(References 35 below) There are several types of residual market pricing plans used in various states, including those that use different manual rate (or loss costs) in the voluntary and residual markets and those that eliminate or modify premium discounts for large policyholders.\n\n\tThird, the four states with exclusive state funds determine premiums using state-specific procedures. For example, each fund has a unique set of insurance classifications and experience rating formula, and Washington bases premiums on hours worked rather than payroll (as in all states with private carriers).\n\n\tEmployers that self-insure-that is, pay benefits to their own employees without use of an insurance carrier-represent a \"pure\" form of experience rating in which an employer's costs are solely determined by the benefits to that firm's employees. This characterization needs to be qualified to some degree because self-insuring employers generally purchase excess risk policies that protect them against unusually adverse experience; have administrative expenses that may not vary in proportion to benefit payments; and may be subject to assessments to support state workers' agencies or other purposes that are not solely based on benefit payments.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n31.

The salary reduction feature allows employers to share costs with employees on a cost-effective basis. The employer decides how much it is able or willing to pay for health coverage and then employees pay the difference through salary reduction.\n\n\tIn general, health care FSAs may not be used to pay for medical plan premiums (see KB-1 Topic 2215). However, health care premiums may be paid on a pre-tax basis through the premium conversion feature.\n\nA premium-only plan is not a separate welfare plan under Title I of ERISA.\n\n1 PWBA Opinion Letter 96-12A, July 17, 1996\n"

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

A federal government agency known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the program. Medicare is designed to protect retirees age 65 and over from devastating medical costs that result from long-term hospitalization. Long-term care outside of a hospital is a cost not adequately covered by government or employer medical plans.\n\tThe Medicare program has a role in assisting employers to provide retiree health care.\n\nEligibility\n\tBroadly, Medicare entitles those individuals who are age 65 or over and eligible to receive Social Security benefits, survivor benefits, or disability benefits to hospital coverage and, at an additional cost, to insured physician payments. These are the two parts of Medicare, known as Part A and Part B.\n\nPart A coverage\n\tPart A of Medicare pays for inpatient hospital care and services and covers skilled nursing home services. Inpatient care includes medically necessary nursing, drugs, diagnostic or therapeutic care, supplies, equipment, and appliances. Home health care or hospice care may also qualify for reimbursement by Medicare.\n\tPart A is subject to deductibles on a per-episode basis ($1,408 for 2020) and to coinsurance for each day of care beyond the sixtieth. There are limits on the number of days allowed for skilled nursing care and psychiatric hospitalization.\n\tMost people do not pay a monthly Part A premium because they or a spouse has 40 or more quarters of Medicare-covered employment. In fact, only about one percent of people with Medicare pay a premium for Part A services. For people who have to buy Part A, the full Part A premium for 2020 is $458 per month.\n\n\nPart B coverage\n\tPart B applies to physician and professional services. This coverage is voluntary and costs the Medicare beneficiary a premium on a monthly basis. The standard Part B premium amount in 2020 will be $144.60, though an income-related adjustment will be applied to individuals and couples at higher incomes. However, most people who get Social Security benefits will pay less than this amount. The annual deductible for Part B for 2020 is $198 per year. Covered services include ambulance, X-ray and diagnostic tests, ambulatory surgical care, outpatient hospital care, physical and occupational therapy, durable medical equipment, and physician charges whether the patient is hospitalized or not.\n\tThe Medicare beneficiary may pay for Part B services by assigning payment or by seeking reimbursement for payments made to the health care provider. Reimbursement allowances are based on reasonable and customary charges, except for physician's services, which are based on a fee schedule. Physicians are allowed to collect coinsurance amounts from the beneficiary.\n\tPointer: Because of the deductibles and co-insurance amounts required under both Parts A and B, a large percentage of Medicare beneficiaries have some type of private supplemental health insurance (known as Medigap) to fill specific gaps in the Medicare coverage system.\n\nMedicare Part D\n\tThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) created a new Medicare Part D Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program. The program became effective January 1, 2006, and is the primary payor of prescription drugs for Medicare-eligible individuals who are no longer employed.\n\tA standard prescription drug plan beginning in 2020 requires a $435 deductible. The beneficiary pays 25 percent of the drug costs up to $4,020 (in 2020) after the deductible is met. Drug costs above $4,020 are paid out-of-pocket until the beneficiary has paid $6,350 in 2020. In 2020, after exiting the donut hole, co-pays are $3.60 for generics and preferred multiple source drugs and $8.95 for all other drugs. After the $5,100 figure is met, the beneficiary pays 5 percent of the drug cost, or a modest copayment. A subsidy is available for low-income beneficiaries. However, many prescription plans are available which offer better than the standard benefits, with deductibles of zero, and coverage in the \"gap.\"\n\tThe Act also provides for a nontaxable subsidy to employers that maintain retiree drug benefits that are \"actuarially equivalent\" to Medicare Part D. Employers will have to retain records that are sufficient to ensure the adequacy of the coverage and the accuracy of the payments made. The employers must also tell HHS and Part D-eligible individuals whether or not the plan meets the actuarial equivalence standard.\n\tElimination of deduction for Part D subsidy. Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the provision that allows an employer to disregard the value of any qualified retiree prescription drug plan subsidy in calculating the employer's business deduction for retiree prescription drug costs was repealed, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. Thus, the amount otherwise allowable as a business deduction for retiree prescription drug expenses will be reduced by the amount of the excludable subsidy payments received.(Reference 1 below)\n\nMedicare payment systems\n\tMedicare pays for most Part A services under a prospective payment system (PPS). Under this system, payment for care is based on the assignment of the case to a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). See below.\n\nMedicare as secondary payer\n\tOriginally, Medicare was the primary insurer for the working aged (those individuals who are age 65 and older but continue to work for an employer of 20 or more employees). As the expenses of Medicare rose, Congress began to look for ways to shift the cost burden to private insurance companies.\n\tIn 1980, Congress enacted the first set of Medicare Secondary Payer provisions that transferred the responsibility of paying primary health care benefits for the working aged to private employer health plans. The laws were refined subsequently to permit the government to recover overpayments from the person, the employer plan, the provider, any third party, or \"any entity that would be responsible for payment with respect to such item or service.\"\n\tWhen a payment by Medicare is on behalf of a plan for which the insurer acts solely as administrator, the government must look to the employer, rather than to the insurer, for reimbursement. Furthermore, an insurer must notify the government when. it learns of a possible primary payment by Medicare, regardless of whether the payment has actually been made.\n\tGenerally, Medicare has carved out certain segments of the age 65 and over population. For individuals who continue to work past age 65, Medicare is the secondary payer. For spouses 65 or older, even if the employee is under age 65, Medicare is the secondary payer.\n\n\tEmployers are required to offer employees age 65 or over the same group health plan coverage as is available to younger employees. The employee and spouse then have the option of choosing the employer plan or Medicare as their primary plan. If they choose Medicare as the primary plan, the employer may not offer complementary coverage, however, if the employer plan is primary, Medicare is the secondary plan.\n\tPointer: This does not require\u00b7 employers to offer coverage if they do not normally do so. However, it does mean that employers must extend the coverage to persons who work past age 65 if the employer offers a health plan.\n\nDiagnosis related groups\n\tIn order to try to cope with spiraling medical costs, Medicare adopted in 1983 a payment system to regulate the cost of care based on the type of illness. Diseases were categorized into Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Reimbursement from Medicare for inpatient hospital care depended on the DRG assigned, which was based on the diagnosis and procedure, age of the patient, and complications, if any. The type of hospital and its mix of cases also contributed to the weight assigned to each DRG.\n\tAt first, physicians and hospitals accepted Medicare's estimate based on reasonable and customary charges as payment in full. As their costs escalated and the freeze on physician cost increases continued, however, the doctors no longer accepted the Medicare amount as full payment, but began to shift costs to the patient. This cost-shifting affected both individuals and employers whose plans paid for what Medicare did not cover or reimburse fully.\n\tDRGs assign patients and the kinds of resources used to treat them into approximately 510 categories within 25 major diagnostic categories (MDCs).\nThe assignment to a DRG is made by compiling the diagnoses and any procedure codes for the treatment. When the initial and subsequent diagnoses are made, a code is assigned. If a surgical procedure is performed, a procedure code is noted. These codes, the patient's age and sex, and any complications are consid\u00ad ered together and a DRG is assigned to the case.\n\tUnder PPS, the DRG may be weighted for the type of facility, case mix, and location. The system then assigns a fixed price for the discharge. Hospitals may retain any difference between the DRG reimbursement and the actual cost, but are to absorb any shortfall.\n\nPhysician reimbursement system\n\tMedicare has extended the DRG concept of payment to physician fees by establishing a resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). The program is de\u00ad signed not only to control costs but also to encourage prevention and discourage technical medical intervention. Rather than reasonable and customary being the basis for accepting charges from a physician, RBRVS considers the resources required for each service, a monetary conversion factor, and the geographic location. Services of family practitioners are valued higher than those of surgeons and radiologists. In addition, balance billing by nonparticipating physicians is limited.\n\nCase review\n\tMedicare also attempts to ensure appropriate care by reviewing cases. Peer review organizations (PROs) evaluate the medical necessity of the treatment on a retrospective basis. If PROs find treatment was not needed, physicians must refund to the patient any fees collected for this care. The burden for efficient care now rests with the facilities that choose to accept Medicare patients. The patients are protected against extreme costs since their doctors have accepted the Medicare payment.\n\nEmployers and Medicare\n\tEmployers attempting to coordinate a retiree health care program with Medi\u00ad care are aiming at a moving target. Coverage and premium costs change, yet employers do not want to absorb the full burden of hospital costs so long as the government program is adequate. Medicare does not cover all retirees. People who retired before attaining age 65 are not covered until they reach age 65. Those who are 65 but are not eligible for Social Security benefits may not be eligible for Medicare.\n\tHowever, many employers have found that coordinating a retiree medical plan similar in design to preretirement medical plans with Medicare is the least expensive way for an employer to provide coverage to retirees age 65 and over.\n\n\tThe three most common methods of coordinating retiree medical benefits with Medicare are the following:\n\tl. carve-out method-this method enables a company to limit plan liability to the difference between the amount covered by Medicare and the amount the company's plan would normally pay;\n\t2. standard coordination method-this method requires the plan to pay the usual benefit, not exceeding the amount of an expense that has not been paid by Medicare-this provides the most generous net benefit of the three choices; \t\tand\n\t3. government exclusion or Medicare exclusion method\u00ad this method allows a plan to reduce the amount of an expense not covered by Medicare by applying the plan deductible and coinsurance amounts to determine the actual benefit \t\tpayable.\n\nMedicare coverage\n\tAs currently structured, Medicare has several significant exclusions, namely, long-term custodial care, non-hospital mental health care, and elective care.\n\nSupplementary insurance\n\tBecause of the deductibles and coinsurance amounts required under both Parts A and B, most Medicare beneficiaries have some type of private supplemental health insurance coverage. The law provides rules governing Medigap insurance (i.e., supplemental insurance policies that are designed to fill specific gaps in the Medicare benefit structure).\n\nFor more information ...\n\tMedicare risk HMOs are addressed in more detail at KB-1 Topic 1007.\n\tMedicare is covered in greater depth at KB-1 Topic 53,140 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 Code Sec. 139A, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act) (P.L. 111-148); Act Sec. 9012(b) of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by Act Sec. 1407 of the Health Care and Education Reconcilia\u00ad tion Act of 2010 (P.L. ill-152).\n"

States have special coordination concerns because of their dual status as employers and insurers. The critical question in COB is \"Who pays first?\" Table 21-3 summarizes the answers to this question.\n\n                Some categories of drugs are made to providers for Medicare Parts A and B, and, therefore, not Part D. Medicare Parts A and B cover bundled payments to acute care hospitals and SNFs that generally cover all treatment provided during the stay. (Exceptions for inpatient hospital stays are clotting factors, while exceptions for SNF stays are high-cost chemotherapy.) Medicare Parts A and B also cover payments to physicians for drugs and biologicals that are administered by infusion or injection, but they do not cover self-injectables and most outpatient prescriptions. (See Appendix 21.7 for a list of medications specifically covered under Medicare Part B.)\n\nMedications Covered Under Medicare Part D\nCMS provides the following definitions for medications covered under Part D:\n\u25a0 A Part D-covered drug is available only by prescription, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (or is a drug described under Section 1927(k)(2)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act), used and sold in the United States, and used for a medically accepted indication (as defined in Section 1927(k)(6) of the Act).\n\nTABLE\t21\u00b73\n\nCOBPrimary Payers\n\nPart D plus...\tPays First\nState Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs)\tPart D\nRetiree covered under former employer's group health plan (GHP)\tPart D\nAlso covered under the GHP of retired spouse\tPart D\nRetiree GHP + SPAP\t(1) Part D, (2) GHP, (3) SPAP\nMedicaid\tEither Part D or Medicaid\nRetiree GHP + Medicaid\tPart D, then GHP\nGHP, then Medicaid\t\nCurrently working with coverage through GHP\tGHP, then Part D\nCovered under GHP of actively working spouse\tGHP, then Part D\nCovered under Workers' Compensation (WC)\tWC, then Part D for injury-related treatment\nNo-fault or liability coverage (NF/LC)\tNF/LC, then Part D for injury/ illness-related treatment\n\n\n\u25a0 A covered Part D drug includes prescription drugs, biological products, insulin as described in specified paragraphs of Section 1927(k) of the Act, and vaccines licensed under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act.\n\u25a0 The definition also includes \"medical supplies associated with the injection of insulin (as defined in regulations of the Secretary). We define those medical supplies to include syringes, needles, alcohol swabs, and gauze.\"\n\u25a0 The definition of supplies associated with the delivery of insulin to the body was expanded to include injection and inhalation, effective June 9, 2008.\n\u25a0 Effective January 1, 2008, fees for vaccine administration were included in Part D.\n\n            Drug benefits will now be available or coordinated with Part D for populations that previously did not have pharmacy benefits. These groups include benefits provided to state employees, retirees, and dependants, many of whom may be Medicare beneficiaries; Medicaid coverage provided to low-income beneficiaries, many of whom may be Medicare dual-eligibles who will now receive most drug coverage from Medicare Part D; and supplemental drug coverage offered to seniors through the State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAPs). Coordination with SPAPs is a high priority for CMS\n\nMedications Excluded from Medicare Part D\nThe following medications and categories of medications are not covered under Medicare Part D\n\u25a0 Medications available under Parts A or B (even though a deductible may apply)\n\u25a0 Drugs or classes of drugs, or their medical uses, that may be excluded from coverage or otherwise restricted under Medicaid under Section 1927(d)(2) of the Act, with the exception of smoking cessation agents. The drugs or classes of drugs that may currently be otherwise restricted under Medicaid include\n  0 Agents when used for anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain\n  0 Agents when used to promote fertility\n  0 Agents when used for cosmetic purposes or hair growth\n  0 Agents when used for the symptomatic relief of cough and colds\n\u25a0 Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations\n\u25a0 Nonprescription drugs\n\u25a0 Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer or its designee as a condition of sale\n\u25a0 Barbiturates (Reference 15 below)\n\u25a0 Benzodiazepines (Reference 15 below)\n\u25a0 Exclusions added, effective June 9, 2008\n  0 Drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED)\n  0 Drugs used to treat morbid obesity\n\nDrug plan sponsors can generally include the Part D-excluded medications as part of supplemental benefits, provided they otherwise meet the definition of a Part D drug. For example, because nonprescription over\u00ad the-counter (OTC) drugs do not otherwise meet the definition of a Part D drug, they may not be included as part of supplemental benefits; however, OTC medications may be covered under the following condition:\n\u25a0 Under certain conditions as part of a utilization management program (including a step-therapy program), nonprescription drugs can be provided at no cost to enrollees.\n\u25a0 The cost of these drugs to the plan would be treated as administrative costs under such programs.\n\nFDA  Nonmatch List\n          CMS has published a list of \"Nonmatched\" National Drug Codes (NDCs) that are not eligible for reimbursement under Part D plans after January 1, 2010. (Reference 16 below) CMS will use this updated list to establish new edits that will reject prescription drug event (PDE) submissions from Part D sponsors for NDCs identified on the list. The nonmatched NDC list was developed as part of an ongoing joint initiative between CMS and FDA to increase transparency and clarity with respect to the regulatory status of marketed prescription drug products.\n\nCMS has also provided clarifications to the use of the drug list: (Reference 17 below)\n\u25a0 This list cannot be used to determine a drug's status as approved or unapproved.\n\u25a0 This list may not identify all NDCs not properly registered and listed with the FDA.\n\u25a0 Not all NDCs on the nonmatched NDC list are otherwise Part D drugs (e.g. some NDCs are for excluded drugs) and, therefore, proper listing of such products with the FDA will not necessarily result in coverage under Part D.\n\u25a0 Edits apply only to PDEs with dates of service on or after January 1, 2010.\n\u25a0 CMS planned to update the list at least twice during the 2010 plan year by deleting NDCs that have been registered and listed with the FDA since the fall 2009 posting of the list and removing associated PDE edits. Removal of edits will apply both retrospectively and prospectively for all dates of service.\n\u25a0 Additional NDCs were not to be added to the CY 2010 Nonmatched NOC list during the 2010 plan year. CMS expects Part D sponsors to rely on the FDA NOC Directory to determine when NDCs get listed and not wait for CMS to update the nonmatched NOC list. While this may result in a time lag between the CMS edit updates and the FDA NOC Directory listings, which could require resubmission of previously rejected PDEs, Part D sponsors should not wait to remove associated point-of-sale edits once NDCs are listed with the FDA.\n\u25a0 At this time, CMS is not considering making any changes to the Formulary Reference File or accepting negative formulary change requests in relation to the nonmatched NOC list.\n\u25a0 Questions or concerns about FDA's NOC Directory, FDA's drug listing procedures, or possible inaccuracies in the nonmatched NOC list, should be addressed to the FDA's Drug Registration and Listing Team. (Reference 18 below)\n\u25a0 Questions or concerns about PDE reject edits for NDCs listed on the nonmatched NOC list should be addressed to the CMS. (Reference 19 below)\n\nCMS Contractor for Oversight of COB\n            In 1999, CMS named Group Health, Inc. (GHI) as the COB contractor. The COB contractor consolidates activities to support the collection, management, and reporting of all health insurance coverage of Medicare beneficiaries to implement an improved plan for coordinating Medicare benefits with other insurance coverage. The COB contractor will use a variety of methods and programs to identify situations in which Medicare beneficiaries have other health insurance that is primary to Medicare. In such situations, the other health plan has the legal obligation to meet the beneficiary's health care expenses first before Medicare.\n\nAs part of its contract, the COB contractor coordinates the following activities:\n\u25a0 Various questionnaires sent to beneficiaries, employers, providers, and insurers about group health plan coverage\n\u25a0 Voluntary data sharing agreements (VDSAs) among CMS and employers and insurers to exchange enrollment information on Medicare beneficiaries\n\u25a0 Coordination of benefits agreements (COBAs) between CMS and supplemental health insurers to coordinate the payment of claims after Medicare has made its payment\n\u25a0 Sharing of drug enrollment data by\n  \u00b0 Facilitating the calculation of TrOOP by the Part D Plans\n  \u00b0 Facilitating billing in the appropriate order at the pharmacy point of sale\n    0  Ensuring that SPAPs have the information they need to develop their benefit structures\n    0  Ensuring that Medicaid agencies know which of their beneficiaries are dual-eligibles\n    0 Simplifying the exchange of enrollment files for employers claiming the employer subsidy\n\n\nVoluntary Data Sharing Agreements\n           VDSAs were originally developed to enable CMS, insurers, and employers to coordinate benefits and reduce mistaken payments and administrative expenses. They also allow an exchange of employer group health program (GHP) coverage information for Medicare entitlement information. Concurrently, they allow GHPs to meet Medicare secondary payer reporting requirements and provide them with Medicare entitlement information so they can determine when Medicare should be the primary payer. VDSAs also collect drug coverage information that is supplemental to Medicare for TrOOP facilitation, in exchange for Part D entitlement information. Finally, they allow employers to use VDSAs to submit drug coverage enrollment files to claim the employer subsidy.\nState Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs must also share data. They use a process similar to the VDSA program so that SPAPs can receive Medicare Part D entitlement information. To comply with Part D, the SPAP must submit a monthly electronic file of all its enrollees to the COB contractor. The COB contractor then responds with a file detailing the Medicare Part D entitlement of those enrollees. This information includes Part D entitlement dates, the enrollee's Part D Plan, the monthly Part D Plan pre\u00ad mium amount, and effective dates and the level of the low-income subsidy.\n\nCoordination of Benefits Agreements\n             CMS consolidated the claims crossover trading partner agreements with Medicare contractors into the COBA process at the COB contractor. These agreements are negotiated and maintained between CMS and supplemental health insurers (and Medicaid State Agencies, and their fiscal agents) for the exchange of entitlement and paid claims data. The overall goal of this process is to (1) coordinate correct claim payments by Medicare and supplemental health insurers; and (2) report other drug coverage that is supplemental to Part D to facilitate the tracking of TrOOP and to facilitate billing at the pharmacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n15. Effective in 2013, plans must cover benzodiazepines, as well as barbiturates if used to treat epilepsy, cancer, or a chronic mental health disorder.\n16.

                    "text": "KB-4 - Chapter 1 - Introduction - 1.05 Overview of ERISA\u2019s Regulation of Employee Benefit Plans\n\n\tEnacted in 1974 and amended a multitude of times since then,(Reference 54 below) ERISA is a very complex and extensive piece of legislation. It contains four separate titles and is administered by four different administrative agencies.(Reference 55 below) Indeed, the breadth and complexity of ERISA can be seen by the fact that six different sections of the American Bar Association have committees on employee benefits and executive compensation.(Reference 56 below)\n\n[A] Statutory Framework\n\n\tERISA is not a single statute.(Reference 57 below) Rather, it consists of four separate titles which are codified in three separate titles of the United States Code (U.S.C.):\n\n\t\t(1) 29 U.S.C., the labor laws,\n\t\t(2) 26 U.S.C., the Internal Revenue Code, and\n\t\t(3) 42 U.S.C., the Public Health Service Act.\n\n[1] Title I\n\n\tTitle I of ERISA is entitled Protection of Employee Benefits Rights. It contains definitions,(Reference 58 below) extensive reporting and disclosure requirements,(Reference 59 below) vesting and participation rules,(Reference 60 below) minimum funding standards,(Reference 61 below) fiduciary rules,(Reference 62 below) administration and enforcement provisions,(Reference 63 below) and rules governing group health plans.(Reference 64 below)\n\n\tFor the most part, Title I of ERISA is codified in 29 U.S.C. as part of the labor laws and is generally administered by the Department of Labor. One section of Title I of ERISA, section 715,(Reference 65 below) regarding group health plans, incorporates elements of the Public Health Service Act,(Reference 66 below) which is codified in Title 42 of the U.S.C. The Public Health Service Act is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n[2] Title II\n\n\tTitle II of ERISA sets forth amendments to the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"), which are codified in 26 U.S.C., and are generally administered by the Department of Treasury. Many of the provisions in the IRC are substantially parallel to provisions in Title I of ERISA. For example, like Title I of ERISA, the IRC imposes minimum participation,(Reference 67 below) minimum funding,(Reference 68 below) vesting,(Reference 69 below) and anti-alienation requirements(Reference 70 below) on qualified plans. Generally, a plan must satisfy the requirements set forth in the IRC in order to receive favorable income tax treatment.\n\n[3] Title III\n\n\tTitle III of ERISA allocates regulatory jurisdiction over ERISA. Although Title I is generally regulated by the Department of Labor and Title II is generally regulated by the Department of Treasury, this is not always true. With respect to ERISA's provisions that are duplicated in both Title I and Title II, Title III of ERISA directs the Department of Treasury and the Department of Labor to work together to avoid unnecessary expense and duplication(Reference 71 below) and specifically grants regulatory authority over the minimum participation, funding, and vesting standards to the Department of Treasury.(Reference 72 below) In addition, Title III requires that the two agencies provide certain notifications to each other.(Reference 73 below)\n\n\tTitle III is intended to ease plan administration and ensure that plan sponsors are not required to comply with two separate, potentially conflicting, sets of regulations.(Reference 74 below) Like Title I, Title III is codified in the labor laws in 29 U.S.C.\n\n[4] Title IV\n\n\tTitle IV of ERISA governs the termination of defined benefit pension plans.(Reference 75 below) It creates the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\") which is then charged with administering a termination insurance program for defined benefit plans in the event of insolvency. Title IV is intended to ensure that participants in covered plans receive a minimum guaranteed benefit in the event their plan is terminated. Covered plans are required to pay annual premiums to fund the PBGC and its insurance program.\n\n\tLike Titles I and III, Title IV is codified in the labor laws in 29 U.S.C.\n\n[B] ERISA's Numbering System\n\n\tERISA's numbering system is a bit complicated. ERISA has its own numbering system covering Titles I, III, and IV of ERISA. It begins with section 1, the short title and table of contents, and continues (with significant gaps)(Reference 76 below) through section 4402, effective date and special rules.\n\n\tERISA practitioners always refer to the provisions in Titles I, III, and IV of ERISA by their ERISA section number. Thus, an ERISA practitioner refers to ERISA's general preemption provision as ERISA \u00a7514.\n\n\tTitles I, III, and IV of ERISA are codified in Title 29 of the U.S.C., the labor laws. The section number in the codified labor law is quite different from the ERISA section number. For example, ERISA's general preemption provision, ERISA \u00a7 514, is codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144, and ERISA's general minimum funding standards provision, ERISA \u00a7 302, is codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1082.\n\n\tAlthough ERISA practitioners refer to ERISA's provisions by their ERISA section number, courts often refer to them by their codified labor law number. Thus, for example, courts may refer to ERISA's preemption provision as 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144.(Reference 77 below) Moreover, courts sometimes erroneously refer to the labor law codification number as an ERISA section number.(Refernce 78 below) For example, courts have referred to ERISA \u00a7 511, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140, as ERISA \u00a7 1140,79 and ERISA \u00a7 404, codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104, as ERISA \u00a7 1104.(Reference 80 below)\n\n\tThroughout the text, this book follows the ERISA practitioner convention of referring to ERISA's provisions using the ERISA numbering system. Appendix A identifies each of the section numbers in ERISA and the corresponding section number in 29 U.S.C.\n\n\tTitle II of ERISA differs from the other titles of ERISA in that it amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which is codified at 26 U.S.C. These sections are not separately included as ERISA section numbers. Instead, they are contained in the IRC and are referred to by the section number in which they are codified in the IRC. Thus, for example, IRC \u00a7401 refers to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7401.\n\n[C] Coverage\n\n\tERISA's coverage has been described as \"curious.\"(Reference 81 below) In essence, ERISA applies to private sector employee benefit plans but does not apply to governmental plans.(Reference 82 below) Generally speaking, defined benefit pension plans are subject to the most significant regulation under ERISA while welfare benefit plans are least regulated by ERISA.(Reference 83 below)\n\n\tCongress relied on the Commerce Clause for the basis of its power to regulate employee benefit plans. Thus, ERISA \u00a7 4(a) provides that ERISA generally applies to any \"employee benefit plan\"(Reference 84 below) established or maintained by an employer \"engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce\" or any plan established or maintained by unions representing employees engaged in commerce.(Reference 85 below) ERISA \u00a7 4(b) then expressly excepts from coverage five types of plans, the most significant of which is governmental plans.(Reference 86 below) Thus, ERISA applies to almost all private sector employee benefit plans but does not apply to any public sector plans.\n\n\n\tSome of ERISA's provisions apply to all employee benefit plans subject to ERISA. For example, ERISA's reporting and disclosure requirements,(Reference 87 below) fiduciary rules,(Reference 88 below) and administration and enforcement provisions(Reference 89 below) apply to all (or essentially all) employee benefit plans subject to ERISA. Other provisions, in contrast, only apply to a subset of employee benefit plans. For example, the vesting and participation rules only apply to pension plans,(Reference 90 below) while the minimum funding rules(Reference 91 below) and Title IV termination insurance program(Reference 92 below) apply only to defined benefit pension plans. Moreover, some provisions apply solely to group health plans.(Reference 93 below)\n\n[D] Risks against Which ERISA Protects\n\n\tERISA was designed to address two principal risks plan participants and beneficiaries faced under pre-ERISA law:\n\n\t\t(1) default risk, and\n\t\t(2) administration risk.(Reference 94 below)\n\n[1] Default Risk\n\n\tDefault risk is the risk that the employer (or other plan sponsor) may not honor its promise to provide plan participants and beneficiaries with benefits.(Reference 95 below)\n\n\tPension plans(Reference 96 below) give rise to default risk because pension plans promise workers benefits that will be paid in the future. Default risk is much less of a concern in the case of welfare benefit plans because welfare benefits,(Reference 97 below) such as health care benefits, are typically current benefits, that is, benefits that are earned and received in the same year.\n\n\tERISA addressed the default risk inherent in pension plans in three different ways. First, ERISA created minimum funding standards(Reference 98 below) that were intended to require that employers (or other plan sponsors) contribute, over time, sufficient amounts to their plans to ensure that the plans have sufficient funds available to pay the plan participants their promised benefits upon retirement.(Reference 99 below) Second, Title IV of ERISA created an insurance system administered by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)(Reference 100 below) to protect workers' pensions in the event that a pension plan is terminated before it is fully funded.Reference 101 below) Finally, ERISA introduced vesting rules(Reference 102 below) to ensure that employees' pension benefits become nonforfeitable within a reasonable period of time.(Reference 103 below)\n\n\tERISA's rules addressing default risk only apply to pension plans. They do not apply to welfare benefit plans.\n\n[2] Administration Risk\n\n\tAdministration risk concerns the risk that the individuals who are \"responsible for managing and investing plan assets and paying claims may abuse their authority.\"(Reference 104 below)\n\n\tUnlike default risk, administration risk is as likely to arise in the case of a welfare benefit plan as a pension plan.\n\n\tERISA enacted fiduciary provisions to address administration risk.(Reference 105 below) Unlike the rules designed to address default risk, ERISA's fiduciary rules apply to both pension and welfare benefit plans.(Reference 106 below) Thus, despite the fact that ERISA is officially titled the \"Employee Retirement Income Security Act:'(Reference 107 below) and in its early years was usually referred to as the \"Pension Reform Act;'(Reference 108 below) portions of ERISA regulate all employee benefit plans, not just pension or retirement plans.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n54.

ERISA's \"Reporting and Disclosure\" provisions, set forth in Part 1 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, do not have a section entitled \"Coverage:' Thus, the provisions apply to all employee benefit plans subject to ERISA.\n88. ERISA \u00a7 401, the first section of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, provides that the Part 4 fiduciary rules do not apply to certain unfunded plans and agreements providing for payments to retired partners. Thus, the Part 4 fiduciary rules apply to all employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, with these two limited exceptions.\n89. ERISA's \"Administration and Enforcement\" provisions, set forth in Part 5 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, do not have a section entitled \"Coverage.\" Thus, the provisions apply to all employee benefit plans subject to ERISA.\n90. ERISA \u00a7 201, the first section of Part 2 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, provides that the Part 2 participation and vesting rules do not apply to welfare benefit plans. ERISA \u00a7 201(1). Section 201 ofERISA also contains a few other exceptions. See ERISA \u00a7201(2)-(6).\n91.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 13 - Basics of ERISA - Checklist for Determining Whether Welfare Benefit Arrangement Is an ERISA Plan\n\n\tInadvertently creating an ERISA plan could have unintended, and expensive, consequences for employers. In some situations, even minimal employer involvement has led to a court's finding that an arrangement has created an ERISA plan. \n\tHowever, determining whether a particular arrangement is an ERISA plan sometimes can be surprisingly tricky.\n\nIn a nutshell, an ERISA plan exists if:(Reference 1 below)\n\t1. a plan, fund, or program\n\t2. is established or maintained\n\t3. by an employer or an employee organization, or both\n\t4. for the purpose of providing specified kinds of benefits\n\t5. to participants or their beneficiaries.\n\nBelow is a checklist of factors relating to each of these categories that can assist an employer in determining whether a benefits arrangement is an ERISA plan.\n\nPLAN,FUND,OR PROGRAM?\n\n\tCould a reasonable person ascertain what the intended benefits of the arrangement are?\n\tAn employee need not show the exact dollar amount he or she would expect to receive in benefits, as long as a court is able to ascertain benefits due under the plan.\n\tIf payments are made on an ad hoc basis to only a few employees, an ERISA plan is not established because intended beneficiaries cannot reasonably be ascertained.\n\n\tCould a reasonable person determine the class of beneficiaries?\n\n\tCould a reasonable person determine the source of the arrangement's financing?\n\tExamples of an ascertainable source of financing, for this purpose, include a funded trust or the general assets of employer.\n\n\tCould a reasonable person determine the procedures for applying for and receiving benefits under the arrangement?\n\nESTABLISHED OR MAINTAINED?\n\n\tDid the employer intend to create a plan? Did the employer take actions or are there events that record, exemplify, or implement an employer's decision to extend benefits?\n\tAlthough an employer's intention to create (or not create) an ERISA plan is evidence of whether or not there is such a plan, it is not conclusive. Courts may still be willing to find such a plan even without employers' intent.\n\tWhile an employer's decision to extend benefits to employees is not conclusive of whether an ERISA plan exists, an employer's actions or events that record, exemplify, or implement the decision are strong evidence that the decision is real.\n\n\tIs the employer clearly involved in plan administration?\n\tNo single employer act, in itself, is conclusive proof. This is a fact based determination courts look at the level of an employer's involvement.\n\n\tFactors arguing against an ERISA plan:\n\tEmployer merely performs ministerial tasks in assisting the plan's establishment and operation;\n\tEmployer's only act is to collect premiums through payroll deductions and pay them to an insurer; or\n\tEmployer merely publicizes a plan.\n\n\tFactors arguing in favor of an ERISA plan (though none of these alone is conclusive) employer:\n\t\"endorses\" a program (such as by urging or encouraging employees to participate in the plan);\n\tpurchases insurance;\n\tdrafts the plan;\n\tdetermines eligibility for coverage;\n\tinterprets policy language;\n\tadministers or litigates claims; or otherwise engages in activities that reasonably lead an employee to conclude that an employer exercises control over the plan and that the plan is part of the employer's own benefit package.\n \nCaution: An ERISA plan may be found even where an em\u00ad ployer has little or no involvement in plan administration and claims processing where the employer does at least some of the following acts:\n\tdirects employees to fill out enrollment cards;\n\tprovides change of beneficiary cards;\n\tdeducts employees' dependent premiums from their paychecks;\n\tsends enrollment cards and change of beneficiary forms to the plan administrator;\n\treceives and distributes copies of booklets about the\n\tpolicy and copies of the administrator's letter explaining coverage;\n\tinstructs employees to send questions about the plan to the plan administrator; or\n\tallows premiums to be paid through payroll deductions and keeps insurance forms on file.\n\nIs there a written plan document?\n\tA formal, written plan is not a prerequisite to an ERISA plan. While a written plan document is strong proof of\n\tthe existence of an ERISA plan, courts have determined that ERISA plans exist even where there is no written plan document. A plan need not be formalized in writing as long as it is more than a mere decision to extend benefits.\n\tOral assertions or representations by an employer that a plan has been created, if combined with actions that\n\tconfirm those assertions, such as withholding wages or distribution of a brochure from the plan administrator describing the plan, may outweigh an employer's failure to establish a plan formally.\n\tAn employer's failure to reduce a plan to writing does\n\tnot mean that the plan is not an ERISA plan it goes to the issue of whether ERISA is violated because ERISA requires plans to be in writing.\n\nAre employees aware of the plan? Have they reasonably relied on the existence of a plan?\n\tA court may be willing to find the existence of a plan if employees reasonably relied on its existence or on an employer's representations as to its existence.\n\tIn determining whether a formal plan exists, look to all of the events and surrounding circumstances that could lead employees to reasonably think that a plan exists.\n\n \nDoes the arrangement include ongoing administration?\n\tA separate ongoing administrative scheme is necessary for an ERISA plan. An arrangement (such as an employ\u00ad ment contract with severance pay provisions) is not an ERISA plan if the employer could not exercise discretion over the timing, amount, or form of payment.\n\tPayments should be definite and systematic. Ad hoc and unsystematic payments are not enough.\n\tA one time only event does not require ongoing administration.\n\tSingle sum benefits do not require ongoing administration.\n\tThe administrative scheme must be substantial. Simple or mechanical determinations don't require a substantial administrative scheme.\n\nIs the arrangement merely an informal practice, such as a payroll practice, or does it include a funding mechanism?\n\tFor some types of benefits (such as vacation pay and scholarships), whether a benefit has its own funding mechanism (such as a funded trust) can be critical in determining whether it is an ERISA arrangement. For instance, a vacation trust is more likely to be an ERISA plan while a vacation payroll practice (i.e., using an employer's geri.etal assets to pay for benefits) might not be an ERISA plan.\n\tHowever, payment of benefits from the employer's general assets rrtay be enough to meet the ascertainable source of funding rule.\n\tAn income replacement plan is considered a payroll practice and not an ERISA plan if paid from the employer's general assets and independently administered through an administrative services only (ASO) contract.\n\nBY AN EMPLOYER, EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION, OR BOTH?\n\tIs the arrangement offered by an employer or by an employee organization?\n\tTo be a welfare benefit plan covered by ERISA, an arrangement must be established or maintained by an employer, an employee organization, or both.\n\tAn employer includes any person acting directly as an employer or indirectly in the employer's interest, including a bona fide group or association of employers acting for an employer.\n\tImportant factors are the extent of control by employer members and the purpose of the association's existence.\n\tAn employee organization is any labor union or organization, agency, association, group, or plan in which employees participate and which is designed to deal with employers regarding an employee benefit plan or other matters relating to the employment relationship. Membership in an employee organization must be based upon an individual's status as an employee.\n\nEmployer and employee organizations generally should have:\n\texclusivity of membershipe mployer groups and unions with exclusive memberships may jointly establish and maintain welfare benefit plan arrangements.\n\torganizational relationship an employer organization is not recognized if there is no genuine organizational relationship between employers. Employers that participate in a benefit plan must, either directly or indirectly, exercise control over the program, both in form and in substance, in order to qualify as a bona fide employer group.\n\tcommonality of interest an entity maintaining an employee welfare benefit plan and the individuals benefiting from the plan must have a common economic or representation interest unrelated to the provision of benefits. An organization whose members engage in a variety of disparate businesses in different locations throughout the country and whose primary function is\n\tto offer its members the opportunity to purchase health care does not have the necessary commonality of interest.\n\nFOR PROVIDING SPECIFIED KINDS OF BENEFITS?\n\tDoes the arrangement cover subject matter specifically covered by ERISA as a welfare benefit plan?\n\tWelfare benefit plans are plans, funds, or programs that provide participants or their beneficiaries with:\n\tmedical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits;\n\tsickness, accident, disability, or death benefits;, D vacation benefits;\n\tapprenticeship or other programs;\n\tday care centers;\n\tscholarship funds (but only if funded);\n\tprepaid legal services;\n\tunemployment benefits; or\n\tholiday and severance pay plans (or any similar benefits).\n \nDoes the arrangement cover subject matter specifically exempted by ERISA?\n\n\tCertain payroll or workplace practices are specifically exempted by ERISA Under ERISA, welfare benefit plans do not include the following:\n\n\tovertime or other premium pay - the payment of overtime pay, shift premiums, holiday premiums, weekend premiums, or other compensation payments in excess of the normal rate.\n\tsick pay - the payment of normal compensation out of the employer's general assets for periods when an employee is absent from work due to a physical or mental inability to perform job duties or due to medical reasons, such as pregnancy or psychiatric ailments.\n\tleave pay - the payment of compensation out of the employer's general assets while an employee is absent from work on account of vacation, holiday, military service, jury duty, sabbatical, or educational leave.\n\ton-premises facilities - the maintenance (on the premises of an employer or employee organization) of recreation, dining, or other facilities (other than day care centers) for use by employees or members.\n\tfirst-aid centers - the maintenance of facilities, on the employer's premises, for treatment of minor injuries or illness or rendering first aid in case of accidents during working hours.\n\tholiday gifts - distribution of gifts such as turkeys or hams by an employer to employees at Christmas and other holiday seasons.\n\tsales to employees - sale by an employer to employ\u00ad ees of articles or commodities of the type that are offered for sale by the employer in the regular course of business, whether or not at a discount.\n\thiring halls - maintenance by an employer or em\u00ad ployee organization of a hiring hall facility.\n\tremembrance funds - programs designed to provide flowers, obituary notices, and small gifts on events such as sickness, hospitalization, death, or termination of employment.\n\tstrike funds - funds maintained by an employee or\u00ad ganization to provide payments to its members during strikes and for related purposes.\n\tindustry advancement programs - maintenance of an industry advancement program which has no em\u00ad ployee participants and does not directly provide benefits for employees (trusts providing apprenticeship training, services for obtaining federally mandated medical examinations for employees, and training and certification of employees are not considered industry advancement programs).\n\ngroup insurance programs - group insurance programs offered by insurers to employees where:\n\t1. the employer or employee organization does not contribute to the program;\n\t2. participation in the program is voluntary;\n\t3. the employer's or employee organization's only involvement is in (a) permitting the insurer to publicize the program to employees or members and in collecting premiums through payroll deductions or dues check-offs, and (b) without endorsing the program, allowing the insurer to publicize the program; and\n\t4. the employer or employee organization receives no cash or other compensation in con\u00ad nection with the program except for reasonable compensation for services rendered.\n\n\tunfunded scholarship funds - scholarship programs, including tuition and education expense refund programs, under which payments are made from the general assets of an employer or employee organization.\n\tlabor management cooperation funds - funds created under collective bargaining agreements to finance programs to improve working relationships, productivity, health, safety, training, education, or to fund investment in technology and human resources is not a welfare plan if it does not actually provide education or training benefits to employees but only encourages use of local programs.\n\tjob banks - programs that offer alternative jobs to employees whose positions are eliminated because of technological innovations (these are not triggered by the loss of employment and do not provide unemployment benefits to participants).\n\nTO PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES?\n\tWho receives benefits provided under the arrangement? Does it cover employees or only partners or other non employees?\n\nERISA plans cover participants because of their employee status in an employment relationship. A plan in which no employees participate is not an ERISA employee benefit plan.\n\tAn ERISA plan must cover employees, former employees,union members, or beneficiaries of any of these.\n\tPartners are not considered employees for purposes of determining the existence of an ERISA plan. However, a plan that covers only partners might be considered an ERISA plan if it was derived from a group policy that originally covered both partners and non-partner employees.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 This is based on factors first set forth in Dono\u00ad van v.

ERISA simply sets the rules governing employee benefits - it doesn't require employers to provide any benefits or offer any financial incentive to do so.\n\tOriginally ERISA included very few rules that restricted an employer's choices about how they set up their benefit plans (outside of a few provisions to ensure fairness in defined benefit plans). Since then however, ERISA has been amended repeatedly to add mandatory provisions for different types of benefit plans.\n\tERISA doesn't regulate all employee benefits, just those that are part of an \"employee benefit plan\" (which doesn't have to be a written document). For ERISA to apply, the benefit has to be on ERISA's list of covered benefits, there has to be a plan, program, or fund to provide the benefit and the benefit has to apply to at least one employee.\n"

If an employee dies, becomes incapacitated, loses his or her job or suffers a reduction in work hours, health care coverage can be extended for up to 18 or 36 months, depending on circumstances. \n\n                       The cost of health insurance provided under COBRA is usually high, because the recipient pays the entire premium including the portion that was being paid by the employer. In that sense, COBRA coverage is primarily a stop-gap until less expensive health insurance can be found.\n\n                       To qualify for COBRA coverage, an employee has to have been enrolled in a company-sponsored group health insurance plan on the day before the qualifying event (loss of job, reduced hours, etc.) occurs and the insurance plan must have been in effect on more than 50% of the employer's typical business days during the previous calendar year. ln addition, the employer must still be offering existing employees a group health plan; if the employer stops offering health coverage or goes out of business or drops below 20 employees the employee seeking COBRA coverage may no longer be eligible for extended insurance benefits.\n\n                       Even small employers with less than 20 employees may be required to provide extended insurance coverage to employees who have suffered a qualifying event. Many states have laws similar to COBRA. These \"mini-COBRA\" laws generally apply to employers of all sizes, including those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n"

Small employer plans.-plans of employers who normally employed fewer than 20.employees on a typical business day during the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which a qualifying event with respect to any qualified beneficiary occurred;\n\t\t2. Governmental plans.-plans that are established by and maintained for the employees of the federal government or state or local governments; and\n\t\t3. Church plans.-plans established by a church, or tax-exempt convention or association of churches, for its employees or their beneficiaries as defined by Code Sec. 414(e).\n\nGroup health plans\n\tFor COBRA purposes, a group health plan is a plan maintained by an employer or a union or other employee organization to provide health care to individuals (or their families) who have an employment relationship to the employer or employee organization. People who have an employment-related connection include employees, former employees, the employer and others associated or formerly associated with the employer or employee organization in a business relationship (including union members who are not currently employees).(Reference 2 below)\n\n\tPlans subject to COBRA.-The following group health plans are subject to COBRA:(Reference 3 below)\n\t\t\u25a1 insured and self-insured health plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 retiree health plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 executive health plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 cafeteria plans that include health plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other managed care plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs); D dental plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 vision plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 hearing plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 on-site medical facilities providing more than first aid;\n\t\t\u25a1 prescription drug plans;\n\t\t\u25a1 alcohol and substance abuse treatment programs; and\n\t\t\u25a1 mental health plans.\n\n\tPlans not subject to COBRA. The following plans are not subject to COBRA requirements:\n\t\u25a1 qualified long-term care services;\n\t\u25a1 medical savings accounts; \n\t\u25a1 health savings accounts;\n\t\u25a1 life insurance programs;\n\t\u25a1 accidental death/dismemberment plans; \n\t\u25a1 vacation benefit plans; and\n\t\u25a1 disability plans (generally speaking).(Reference 4 below)\n\n\tPointer: Status of some plans is unclear. For COBRA purposes, the status of certain employer-sponsored plans (such as wellness or health promotion programs, employee assistance programs, and annual physical examination allowances or plans) and fringe benefits (such as in-house exercise rooms or first aid facilities) is unclear. These must be examined on a case-by-case basis.\n\tFor example, an employee assistance plan (EAP) that provides crisis counseling and referral probably does not provide medical care. On the other hand, an EAP that offers ongoing counseling would be more likely to qualify as offering medical care, and thus, need to be included for COBRA purposes.\n\nSmall employer plans\n\tAn employer is exempt from the COBRA rules if it normally employed fewer than 20 employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year.(Reference 5 below) An employer qualifies for the COBRA small employer exception if it employed fewer than 20 individuals on at least 50 percent of its work days in the previous year.(Reference 6 below)\n\tCounting employees. When counting the number of employees, only full\u00adtime and part-time common law employees are taken into account.(Reference 7 below) A full-time employee counts as a full employee and a part-time employee counts as a fraction of a full-time employee. The fraction is equal to the number of hours that the part-time employee works for the employer, divided by the number of hours that an employee would have to work in order to be considered a full-time employee. Full-time employee status must be determined in a manner consistent with the employer's general employment practices, although not more than eight hours a day or 40 hours a week may be used.(Reference 8 below)\n\tEmployers may either count employees for each typical business day or count them for a pay period and attribute the total number of employees for that period to each typical business day falling within the pay period. The same method has to be used for all employees and for the entire year with respect to which the small\u00ad employer plan determination is made. Employers are permitted to count part-time employees on either an aggregate basis or on an individual basis, as both methods produce identical results, according to the IRS.\n\tEven if the employer's normal workforce falls below 20 employees, its employees may continue to be protected by COBRA if the employer had 20 or more employees in the year preceding the qualifying event.(Reference 9 below)\n\tState law treatment. Over 35 states have enacted so-called mini-COBRA laws.These state laws often require small employers to offer continuation coverage.\n\tEntities under common control. In determining whether the small employer exemption applies, all entities under common control are treated as one employer. A multiemployer plan includes members of a controlled group.(Reference 10 below)\n\t\n\tThe following example illustrates this common control limitation:\n\tExample: David Whitney owns 100 percent of the stock in each of two corporations, ABC Corporation and XYZ Corporation. ABC Corporation has 15 employees and XYZ Corporation has 16 employees. Since corporations ABC and XYZ are members of a controlled group of corporations (by virtue of being a brother-sister controlled group), both companies must be treated as one employer with 31 employees. Therefore, the small employer exemption does not apply and COBRA continuation coverage would be required in this situation.\n\n\tSmall employers and business reorganizations. In a case where two separate employers who normally employed fewer than 20 employees became a single employer after a stock transfer, the IRS determined that a group health plan maintained by the combined entity ceased to be exempted from COBRA as a small\u00ad employer plan as of the date of the stock transfer since the combined entities normally employed at least 20 employees during the previous calendar year.\n\tWhere one employer acquired substantial assets of another employer and continued the business operation associated with those assets, the IRS held that the acquisition of the assets did not make the acquiring employer a single employer with any part of the seller of the assets. Therefore, the acquiring employer's plan continued to be exempted from COBRA until the year following the year in which the acquiring employer had at least 20 employees. Note: if the acquiring company is a successor employer to the seller of the assets, then the acquiring company does take on any COBRA obligations that the seller would have had.(Reference 11 below)\n \nGovernmental plans\n\n\tPlans maintained for employees of the federal government or state or local governments are exempt from the COBRA rules.(Reference 12 below)\n\n\tCaution: Although governments are not required to comply with COBRA, similar requirements under the Public Health Service Act impose nearly identical continuation coverage requirements on state and local government employers (other than those with fewer than 20 employees). \n\t(Reference 13 below) Enforcement of the Public Health Service Act requirements is achieved through suits for equitable relief filed by qualified beneficiaries.\n\nCOBRA-like rules also apply to employees of the federal government (Reference 14 below)\n\n1 Code Sec. 4980B(d).\n2 Code Sec. 4980B(g); Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-2, Q/ A-l(a).\n3 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-2, Q/ A-l(f).\n4 Code Sec. 4980B (g)(2); IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-2, Q/A-l(f); IRS Notice 2004-2, I.R.B. 2004-2, 1/12/2004.\n5 Code Sec. 4980B(d)(l).\n6 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-2, Q/ A-5(a).\n7 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-2, Q/ A-5(c).\n8 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-2 Q/ A-5(e). \n9 Code Sec. 4980B(d).\n10 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-2.\n11 Revenue Ruling 2003-70, I.RB. 2003-27, July 7,2003.\n12 Code Sec. 4980B(d).\n13 Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300 et seq.), Act Sec. 2201, which parallels ERISA Secs. 601 et seq.\n14 Federal Employees Health Benefits Amend\u00ad ments Act (P.L. 100-654).\n"

If an EAP provides counseling for medical conditions as well as for financial problems, legal difficulties, family problems, and marital difficulties, are the nonmedical benefits subject to COBRA? COBRA and its regulations are silent on the question.\n\tIf an EAP is merely a toll-free referral service that provides employees with contact information to receive legal, financial, or psychological assistance, it is probably not covered by COBRA since diagnosis of an illness or injury is not included.\n\n\tPointer: Where both medical and nonmedical counseling are provided by an EAP, the employer might consider doing whatever is administratively most convenient, as long as eligible beneficiaries are given the opportunity to elect to continue that part of the EAP providing medical benefits. As noted above, however, COBRA and its regulations are silent on the matter.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. Code Sec. 213(d)(l) (A).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 842 - Health Care Reform - Eligibility Rules - Grandfathered Health Plans\n\n\tAccording to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), certain group health plans and health insurance coverage which are in effect as of March 23, 2010, and which make no prohibited changes in plan provisions, are subject only to certain provisions of the ACA. These plans are called grandfathered health plans.\n\n\tACA provisions that apply. A grandfathered plan is subject to the following provisions of the ACA:\n\n\t\t\u2022 extension of adult child coverage(Reference 1 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 880);\n\t\t\u2022 prohibition on rescinding coverage (Reference 2 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 880);\n\t\t\u2022 elimination of annual and lifetime limits (Reference 3 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 880);\n\t\t\u2022 prohibition on excessive waiting periods (Reference 4 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 892);\n\t\t\u2022 requirements to provide uniform explanations of coverage and standardized definitions (Reference 5 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 926);\n\t\t\u2022 insurer requirements to provide loss-ratio reports and rebate premiums if loss ratios fall below 80% (Reference 6 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 920); and\n\t\t\u2022 elimination of preexisting condition exclusions (Reference 7 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 894).\n\n\tDefinition of grandfathered health plan coverage. A group health plan or group health insurance coverage does not cease to be grandfathered health plan coverage merely because one or more (or even all) individuals enrolled on March 23, 2010, cease to be covered, provided that the plan or group health insurance coverage has continuously covered someone since March 23, 2010 (not necessarily the same person, but at all times at least one person). This determination is made separately with respect to each benefit package made available under a group health plan or health insurance coverage.(Reference 8 below)\n\t\n\tDisclosure of grandfathered status. To maintain status as a grandfathered health plan, a plan or health insurance coverage must:\n\t\t\n\t\t1. include a statement, in any plan materials provided to participants or beneficiaries describing the benefits provided under the plan or health insurance coverage, that the plan or health insurance coverage believes that it is a grandfathered health plan, and\n\t\t2. provide contact information for questions and complaints.\n\n\tDocumentation of plan or policy terms. In addition, to maintain status as a grandfathered health plan, a plan must maintain records documenting the terms of the plan that were in effect on March 23, 2010, and any other documents necessary to verify, explain, or clarify its status as a grandfathered health plan. Such documents could include intervening and current plan documents, health insurance policies, certificates or contracts of insurance, summary plan descriptions, documentation of premiums or the cost of coverage, and documentation of required employee contribution rates. The plan must make such records available for examination.\n\n\tFamily members enrolling after March 23, 2010. If family members of an individual who is enrolled in a grandfathered health plan as of March 23, 2010, enroll in the plan after March 23, 2010, the plan or health insurance coverage is also a grandfathered health plan with respect to the family members.  \n\t\n\tNew employees joining current plan. A group health plan that provided coverage on March 23, 2010, generally is also a grandfathered health plan with respect to new employees (whether newly hired or newly enrolled) and their families who enroll in the grandfathered health plan after March 23, 2010.9 If the principal purpose of a merger, acquisition, or similar business restructuring is to cover new individuals under a grandfathered health plan, the plan ceases to be a grandfathered health plan.\n\n\tChange in plan eligibility. A group health plan ceases to be a grandfathered health plan if:\n \n\t1. Employees are transferred into the plan (the transferee plan) from a plan under which the employees were covered on March 23, 2010 (the transferor plan).\n\t2. The transferee plan is treated as an amendment to the transferor plan, and this results in a loss of grandfather status under the cessation of grandfathered status rules discussed below.\n\t3. There was no bona fide employment-based reason to transfer the employees into the transferee plan. For this purpose, changing the terms or cost of coverage is not a bona fide employment-based reason.\n\nFor plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, bona fide employment\u00adbased reasons include when:\n\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is being eliminated because the issuer is exiting the market;\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is being eliminated because the issuer no longer offers the product to the employer;\n\t\u25a1 low or declining participation by plan participants in the benefit package makes it impractical for the plan sponsor to continue to offer the benefit package;\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is eliminated from a multiemployer plan as agreed upon as part of the collective bargaining process; or\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is eliminated for any reason and multiple benefit packages covering a significant portion of other employees remain available to the employees being transferred.(Reference 1 below)\n\n\tCollective bargaining agreements. In the case of health insurance coverage maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements ratified before March 23, 2010, the coverage is a grandfathered health plan at least until the date on which the last agreement relating to the coverage that was in effect on March 23, 2010, terminates. Thus, before the last of the applicable collective bargaining agreement terminates, any health insurance coverage provided pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements is a grandfathered health plan, even if there is a change in issuers during the period of the agreement. This provision applies only to insured plans maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and not to self-insured plans.(Reference 11 below)\n\n\tChanges causing cessation of grandfathered status. Certain changes made to the terms of a plan or health insurance coverage will cause the plan or coverage to cease to be a grandfathered health plan. These changes include the following:(Reference 12 below)\n\t\t\n\t\t\u2022 eliminating all or substantially all benefits to diagnose or treat a particular condition;\n\t\t\u2022 increasing a percentage cost-sharing requirement (such as coinsurance);\n\t\t\u2022 increasing a fixed-amount cost-sharing requirement other than a copayment;\n\t\t\u2022 increasing a fixed-amount copayment by more than the greater of $5 (adjusted annually for medical inflation) or a percentage equal to medical inflation plus 15 percentage points;\n\t\t\u2022 decreasing the employer's contribution rate by more than five percentage points; and\n\t\t\u2022 adding or tightening an overall annual limit on the dollar value of benefits.\n\n\t\n\tChanges to only one of several benefits options. In the case where only one of several plan options is changed such that it loses grandfathered status, only that option loses status, while the \"unchanged\" options retain grandfathered status.(Reference 13 below)\n\n\tChanges in employer contribution through restructured tiers. If a group health plan modifies the tiers of coverage it had on March 23, 2010 (for example, from self-only and family to a multi-tiered structure of self-only, self-plus-one, self\u00ad plus-two, and self-plus-three-or-more), the employer contribution for any new tier would be tested by comparison to the'contribution rate for the corresponding tier on March 23, 2010. For example, if the employer contribution rate for family coverage was 50% on March 23, 2010, the employer contribution rate for any new tier of coverage other than self-only (i.e., self-plus-one, self-plus-two, self-plus-three or more) must be within 5 percentage points of 50% (i.e., at least 45%),\n\t\n\tIncrease in copayment level for just one category of services. If a plan increases the copayment higher than the allowed standard for just one category of services (i.e., outpatient services), the plan loses grandfathered status. Each change in cost sharing is tested separately.\n\n\tChanges in contribution rates unknown to issuers. Until final regulations are issued, a group health plan will generally not immediately be treated as losing grandfathered status based on a change in an employer's contribution rate if, (1) upon renewal, the plan issuer requires the plan sponsor to make a representation regarding its contribution rate for the plan year covered by the renewal, as well as its contribution rate on March 23, 2010 and (2) if the issuer's policies, certificates, or contracts of insurance disclose in a prominent and effective manner that plan sponsors are required to notify the issuer if the contribution rate changes at any point during the plan year. This relief would no longer apply as of the earlier of the first date on which the issuer knows that there has been at least a 5-percentage\u00ad point reduction or the first date on which the plan no longer qualifies for grandfathered status for a reason unrelated to the 5-percentage-point reduction.(Reference 14 below)\n\n\tChanges to insurance coverage. A group health plan does not cease to be a grandfathered health plan merely because the plan (or its sponsor) enters into a new policy, certificate, or contract of insurance after March 23, 2010. (Reference 15 below) For example, a plan that enters into a contract with a new issuer or a new policy that is issued with an existing issuer does not lose grandfathered plan status. This applies to such changes to group health insurance coverage that are effective on or after November 15, 2010. It does not apply retroactively to such changes that were effective before this date,\n \n\n \nREFERENCES \n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2714.\n2 PHSA \u00a7 2712.\n3 PHSA \u00a7 2711.\n4 PHSA \u00a7 2708\n5 PHSA \u00a7 2708,\n6 PHSA \u00a7 2718.\n7 PHSA \u00a7 2704.\n8 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-1251(a); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251(a).\n9 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9815-1251(b); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251 (b).\n10 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9815-1251(b)(2)(iii); ERISA Reg.\u00a72590.715-1251(b) (2) (iii).\n11 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-1251(f); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251(!).\n12 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-1251(g)(l); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251 (g) (1).\n13 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Imple\u00ad mentation Part II, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/ faq-aca2.html, October 8, 2010.\n14 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Imple\u00ad mentation Part I, www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq\u00ad aca.html, September 20, 2010.\n15 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9815-1251 (a)(1); ERISA Reg.\u00a72590.715-1251(a)(l).\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Preferred-Provider Organizations\n\n\tA concept that continues to receive considerable attention from employers and insurance companies is the preferred-provider organization. A few PPOs existed on a small scale for many years, but since the early 1980s PPOs have grown steadily in number and in membership. Today, PPOs provide coverage for medical expenses to more Americans than do HMOs, primarily because of the flexibility of covered persons to choose their own medical providers.\n\nWhat Is a PPO?\npreferred-provider organization (PPO)\n\tThe term preferred-provider organization (PPO) tends to be used in two ways. One way is to apply it to health care providers that contract with employers, insurance companies, union trust funds, third-party administrators, or others to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. Using this definition, a PPO may be organized by the providers themselves or by other organizations, such as insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, or employers. Like HMOs, they may take the form of group practices or separate individual practices. They may provide a broad array of medical services, including physicians' services, hospital care, laboratory costs, and home health care, or they may be limited only to hospitalization or physicians' services. Some of these organizations are very specialized and provide specific services, such as dental care, mental health benefits, substance abuse services, maternity care, or prescription drugs. This book refers to these providers not as PPOs but as preferred providers or network providers.\n\tThe second use of the term PPO, and the one generally assumed when the term is used throughout this book, is to apply it to benefit plans that contract with preferred providers to obtain lower-cost care for plan members. PPOs typically differ from HMOs in several respects. First, the PPO generally pays the preferred providers on a fee-for-service basis as their services are used. However, fees are usually subject to a schedule that is the same for all similar providers within the provider network, and providers may have an incentive to control utilization through bonus arrangements. Second, employees and their dependents are not required to use the practitioners or facilities that contract with the PPO; rather, they can make a choice each time medical care is needed, and the PPO also pays benefits for care provided that nonnetwork providers furnish. However, employees have incentives to use network providers; they include lower or reduced deductibles and copayments as well as increased benefits, such as preventive health care. Third, most PPOs do not use a primary care physician as a gatekeeper; employees do not need referrals to see specialists.\n\tEmployers were disappointed with some of the early PPOs. Although discounts were available to members, they seemed to have little effect on benefit costs because discounts were from higher-than-average fees, or providers were more likely to perform diagnostic tests or prolong hospital stays to generate additional fees to compensate for the discounts. These PPOs seldom lasted long. Successful PPOs today emphasize quality care and utilization review. In selecting physicians and hospitals, PPOs look both at the type of care provided and the provider's cost effectiveness. In this era of fierce competition among medical care providers, these physicians and hospitals are often willing to accept discounts in hopes of increasing patient volume. It is also important for a PPO to monitor and control utilization on an ongoing basis and to deal with groups of preferred providers that monitor their own costs and utilization. Generally, however, PPOs do not monitor their preferred providers as closely as HMOs do.\n\nVariations\n\tOver time, PPOs have continued to evolve. A few PPOs compensate providers on a capitation basis, and a few others perform a gatekeeper function. If a member's primary care physician does not recommend a specialist, PPO benefits may be reduced. With these changes, it is sometimes difficult to determine the exact form of a managed care organization. However, those that operate as traditional HMOs generally provide medical expense coverage at a slightly lower cost than do those that operate as traditional PPOs, but there are wide variations among HMOs as well as among PPOs. Therefore, a careful analysis of quality of care, cost, and financial stability is necessary before the selection of a particular HMO or PPO.\n\nexclusive-provider organization (EPO)\n\tAnother variation of the PPO is the exclusive-provider organization, or EPO. The primary difference is that an EPO does not provide coverage outside the preferred-provider network, except in emergencies and those infrequent cases when the network does not contain an appropriate specialist. This aspect of an EPO makes it very similar to an HMO. The number of EPOs is small.\n\nSponsorship\n\tInsurance companies and the Blues established most of the early PPOs to provide products to compete with HMOs. In the early part of this decade, the number of PPOs grew significantly to over 1,000. However, primarily because of mergers, the number has decreased. The majority are still owned by insurance companies and the Blues. Some are owned by HMOs to give them another product in their health plan portfolios to offer employers. Others have a variety of ownership forms, including third-party administrators, private investors, and groups of physicians and/or hospitals.\n\nBenefit Structure\ncenters of excellence\n\tThe basic benefit structure of a PPO is very similar to that of the traditional comprehensive major medical contract. The most significant difference is that there is a higher level of benefits for care received from network providers than there is for care received from nonnetwork providers. Many PPOs have extensive networks of preferred providers, particularly in the geographic areas in which they operate, and there is little reason to seek care outside the network. Some of these PPOs also have reciprocity agreements elsewhere with networks of other PPOs and hospitals (called centers of excellence) that have excellent outcomes and reputations for certain types of medical procedures, such as cancer treatment, organ transplants, or burn treatment. Under these agreements, the PPO pays benefits as if a member receives care from network providers. Other PPOs have more limited networks, and the need and desire for treatment from nonnetwork providers is greater.\n\tThe level of benefits under PPOs may vary because of differences in deductibles, coinsurance, and precertification rules. There may also be a few additional benefits that are available only if a member receives care from a network provider. Finally, the procedures for filing claims also differ. The major purpose of these differences is to encourage an employee or dependent to receive care from preferred providers who agree to charge the plan a discounted fee.\n\nDeductibles\n\tA PPO may have annual deductibles that apply separately to network and nonnetwork charges. For examples, these might be $500 and $1,000, respectively. However, some PPOs have no deductible for network charges. A PPO may waive deductibles for some medical services, such as emergency services.\n\nCoinsurance\n\tPPOs often use coinsurance percentages that are 20 percent (and occasionally 30 percent) lower when a member receives care from nonnetwork providers. A frequently found provision applies 90 percent coinsurance to network charges and 70 percent coinsurance to nonnetwork charges. Coinsurance provisions of 100/80, 90/80, 100/70, and 80/60 are also commonly used. As with deductibles, a PPO may waive the percentage participation for certain medical services. In addition, different stop-loss limits or coinsurance caps, such as $1,000 and $3,000, may apply to network and nonnetwork charges.\n\tAlthough PPOs typically have higher coinsurance percentages for network charges than do traditional major medical plans, a covered person may be responsible for copayments in some circumstances. For example, there might be a copayment, typically ranging from $10 to $25, for each a visit to a primary care physician.\n\nallowable charge\n\tIn evaluating PPOs, it is important to determine the basis the PPO uses to apply the coinsurance percentage. For example, assume a plan uses 80 percent coinsurance for nonnetwork charges and that a charge of $100 is incurred for a medical procedure from a nonnetwork provider. Most PPOs first determine whether this charge is usual, customary, and reasonable. If it is, the plan pays $80. If the plan determines that the usual, customary, and reasonable charge is $90, it will be 80 percent of that amount, or $72. However, some plans apply the coinsurance percentage to what they often refer to as an allowable charge. In most cases, this is the amount that the PPO pays to network providers for the same procedure. In some cases, network discounts are quite large and, for example, the allowable charge in this example might be only $60. For a nonnetwork charge, the plan pays 80 percent of this amount, or $48. Thus the insured has an out-of-pocket expense of $52. Few employees and their families will seek nonnetwork care under this type of plan. For this reason, plans that pay nonnetwork charges on this basis are sometimes referred to as phantom PPOs.\n\nPrecertification Rules\n\tPPOs often have precertification requirements for many types of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, and medical supplies. For network benefits, the person responsible for obtaining the needed certification is the network provider, and the PPO does not penalize a member if the network provider fails to obtain the proper precertification. (This becomes an issue between the PPO and the provider.) However, this responsibility shifts to the employee or family member for nonnetwork services. If he or she does not obtain a required precertification, there usually is a reduction in benefits. For example, what was once 80 percent coinsurance might shrink to 60 percent.\n\nAdditional Network Benefits\n\tFor the most part, PPOs pay benefits for the same medical procedures, whether a network or a nonnetwork provider performs them. However, some PPOs cover a few procedures only if a member receives them from network providers.\n\nClaims\n\tNo claim forms are required for network services. The covered person merely pays any required copayment, and the provider of medical services does the paperwork needed to receive the additional amounts payable by the plan. Just as in traditional major medical plans, it is the ultimate responsibility of the covered person to file the claims forms necessary to receive benefits for nonnetwork care. Of course, the provider may do much of the paperwork and accept an assignment of benefits.\n\nExample\nThe following table shows excerpts of the benefit structure from a sample PPO.\n\nTable 9-2 Selected Benefits under a Sample PPO\n\tNetwork Benefit\tNonnetwork Benefit\nDeductible\tNone\t$500 per person per year.

In fact, they were largely unregulated. As a result, the NAIC created the Preferred Provider Arrangements Model Act, which the majority of states adopted. The act is relatively brief and establishes only a minimal regulatory framework. The act requires that PPOs incorporate cost-containment mechanisms, such as utilization review, to determine whether a service is medically necessary. Covered persons must have reasonable access to medical services. The act also allows PPOs to provide incentives for persons to use the preferred-provider network and to place limitations on the number and types of providers with whom they contract.\n\tNote that most PPO contracts also meet the definition of insurance and are subject to the same regulation by state insurance departments as traditional insurance contracts with respect to contract provisions and benefit mandates.\n\n\n \n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Provider Networks\n\nprovider network\t\n         Networks of providers of health care services and the contracts that establish them are essential to managed care plans. These plans manage care primarily through the provider network that members in the plan are encouraged to use. Members may be required to receive covered medical care services from network providers only, or they must use these providers in order to obtain full plan benefits. To be successful, a managed care plan must create and maintain provider networks that do the following:\n\u2022 contain qualified providers of health care services\n\u2022 meet member needs for medical care services\n\u2022 compensate network providers in a manner that encourages efficient use of resources\n\n\nQualified Providers of Health Care Services\ncredentials\t\n          Managed care plans specify the qualifications, known as credentials, that providers must have and maintain to be a network participant. Physicians, for example, must document their training, licensure, certification in a specialty, and malpractice insurance coverage. In addition, they must be free of limitations, suspensions, or impairments that would affect their practice of medicine and hospital admitting privileges. Hospitals and other institutions must be licensed, accredited, and approved for participation in the Medicare program. Generally, a credentialing verification organization hired by the managed care plan obtains the information to determine if a provider has the qualifications that the plan requires. The plan repeats the credentialing process periodically to make sure that network providers continue to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMember Needs for Medical Care Services\n           A managed care plan's provider network must encompass the broad scope of health services that members may need and be conveniently accessible to those members.\n\n           Network providers include physicians, hospitals and other institutions, diagnostic radiology and laboratory services, and therapy services. Among the other institutions in a network are facilities that provide outpatient care, including surgery, rehabilitation, and skilled-nursing care. Although a few managed care plans may hire their health care professionals and own their facilities, most managed care plans establish their networks through contracts with providers. These providers may be solo practitioners or participate in various types of groups under a variety of organizational structures. A provider often participates in several networks and also treats patients who are not members of managed care plans. Plans may also contract with specialty care organizations for specific services. These services may include psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, radiology, laboratory and pathology services, transplant surgeries, and prescription drug services.\n\n             Networks need to allow members to have reasonably convenient access to the broad range of services that the managed care plan offers. Therefore, managed care plans must develop and maintain sufficient numbers and types of providers to meet member health care needs in a geographic area. In addition, most network physicians must remain open to accepting as patients those members who are new to the plan as well as those who may wish to change providers. As a result, most plans maintain active recruitment and management programs to make sure that their networks keep pace with the needs of their ever-changing member populations in the areas and regions where these members reside. However, competition for members frequently requires managed care plans to expand their networks to offer members a choice of physicians, specialists, and hospitals beyond that required by scope of service and convenience alone.\n\nProvider Compensation\n             A major objective of managed care plans is cost containment through the efficient use of health care resources. The method of provider compensation is one major component of this objective.\n\n             Providers are willing to grant preferred rates to managed care plans because as participants in the plan's network they anticipate an increased number of patients who will utilize their services. Or conversely, they will not lose patients to providers who are network providers. The specific payment method for network providers varies by the type of provider and the negotiating strength of the plan. However, the managed care plan's objective remains the same under any payment arrangement: to control the price of services and the overall increase in the cost of services utilized.\n\n             The compensation for services is determined by agreement in advance of the provision of services and a plan cannot change it for a specified period without notification. It also usually requires the agreement of each party. An important part of the contract with a provider outlines the provider's obligation to accept the agreed-upon amount as payment in full, except for copayments and other clearly identified amounts which the provider must collect from plan members.\n\n              The payment method also intends, if possible, to have providers participate to some degree in the increased cost of services utilized either through incentive payments for meeting utilization targets or penalties for failure to do so. The payment methods managed care plans use include capitation, modification of the traditional fee-for-service payment system, and per-day and per-case rates.\n\n\nCapitation\ncapitation\t\t\n              Although far from dominant, the payment method historically associated with managed care plans is capitation. HMOs frequently employ this method for the payment of primary care physicians if each HMO member is required to select or is assigned a primary care physician who is responsible for the member's care. Primary care physicians provide members with basic health care services and coordinate additional care needs through referrals to other network physicians for certain medical specialist services. Under capitation, these physicians receive a fixed payment per month for each member without regard to the services a member may receive in any particular month. These rates reflect likely utilization of services by the plan's members based on age and gender and the cost of care in the area. Capitation provides physicians no financial incentives to overtreat patients.\n\n\nincentive payment program\nwithhold arrangement\n              In conjunction with capitation, a managed care plan commonly establishes an incentive payment program that rewards physicians who meet budgeted cost and utilization levels for hospital and ancillary services. This program may include other criteria such as meeting member satisfaction and quality standards. Such an incentive program is called a withhold arrangement if it imposes financial penalties or decreases compensation for failure to meet these same criteria.\n\n              HMOs may also use capitation in some cases for the payment of specialty physicians and services such as substance abuse care and chronic condition management. Although infrequent, payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services may also use capitation.\n\n\nModified Fee-For-Service Payments\nmodifiedfee-for-service payment system\n              Despite the cost containment advantages of capitation,\na modified fee-for-service payment system is the dominant method for compensating physicians in managed care plans. Many specialty physicians in managed care plans and most physicians in PPO networks receive payment in this manner. Managed care organizations also occasionally used it with hospitals.\n\n               With this method of compensation, the plan pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, subject to negotiated maximums per procedure. In most cases, this involves a discount from what the physician would charge a patient who did not participate in the managed care plan.\n\n               Modified fee-for-service payment arrangements employed by managed care plans often include some element of physician financial involvement in cost containment through rewards or penalties based on success in achieving the plan's utilization and cost targets. These rewards and penalties are similar to the incentive and withhold arrangements discussed previously under capitation payment.\n\n\nPer-Day and Per-Case Payments\nper-day rate\n                The dominant arrangement used by managed care plans for payment of inpatient hospital services is a negotiated per-day rate. With this approach, a plan pays a hospital a specified amount for each day a plan member is hospitalized, regardless of the actual cost of services on any particular day. The rate usually differs by type or level of care such as intensive care, obstetrics, or rehabilitation. The rate may decrease in relation to the days the member stays in the hospital or the aggregate days of stay for all plan members.\n\nper-case rate\ndiagnosis-related groups\n                 A managed care plan may be able to control costs more effectively by using a per-case rate to pay for hospital stays. With this approach, the plan pays a specified fee for all inpatient costs, regardless of a member's length of stay. This fee is based on such factors as a member's principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, gender, and presence of complications. This system of classification of services is often referred to as diagnosis-related groups.\n\n                 Managed care plans also often use a per-case rate to reimburse hospitals and other providers for nonphysician services that members receive on an outpatient basis.\n"

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider.

                    "text": "KB-5 - Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - HIPAA Administrative Standards\n\nprotected health information (PHI)\n\tAnother important result of HIPAA is the various administrative standards that it imposes on medical expense plans. The act authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set administrative standards for the privacy, security, and electronic exchange of personal health information, which the act refers to as protected health information (PHI). PHI is individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in electronic or other media, including both written and oral communications. It specifically includes genetic information.\n\tThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) expands HIPAA's privacy and security standards. For the most part, ARRA's provisions become effective in February 2010. The provisions on required notifications in the event of a breach of privacy take effect in September 2009. ARRA is referenced subsequently as recent legislation.\n\tEntities subject to these standards include health plans, health information data processors (known as clearinghouses) and health care providers. For purposes of the standards, HIPAA broadly defines health plans to include essentially all individual policies and group plans that provide or pay the cost of medical care, both public and private. However, self-administered plans with fewer than 50 participants are not included in the definition. The definition extends to most insurance companies that provide medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, and long-term care insurance. Employers and plan sponsors are also subject to the rules to the extent they handle PHI.\n\tThe administrative standards impose significant penalties for noncompliance. Civil penalties, increased under recent legislation, now encompass five tiers that range from a low of $100 per violation, not to exceed $25,000 per calendar year, to as high as $50,000 per violation, not to exceed $1.5 million per calendar year. The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines the penalty based on the nature and extent of the harm resulting from the violations. However, the Secretary may use a corrective action plan in place of a penalty.\n\tViolations relating to PHI under the standards may also result in criminal penalties. These penalties can be as high as (1) $50,000 and one year in prison for obtaining or disclosing PHI; (2) $100,000 and 5 years in prison for obtaining PHI under false pretenses; and (3) $250,000 and 10 years in prison for obtaining or disclosing PHI information with the intent to sell, transfer, or use it for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.\n\tIn addition, if there is a breach of PHI, the covered entity is required to notify the affected person within 60 days after discovery. If the breach affects more than 500 individuals, the covered entity must notify the Secretary of HHS and media outlets. Personal health record vendors must also notify individuals of a breach of PHI. A breach is the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of patient health information. Although the law allows certain exceptions to this definition when the disclosure occurs in good faith, an inadvertent disclosure is considered a breach if it results in information being disclosed outside of the confines of a covered entity.\n\tThe Secretary of HHS has the responsibility not only for the creation of the standards for PHI, but also for their enforcement. Subject to the Secretary's jurisdiction, the recent legislation also grants limited authority to the state attorneys general who can bring law suits in federal court on behalf of state residents for the enforcement of these HIPAA provisions.\n\tThe HIPAA provisions that authorize the creation of these standards are known collectively as administrative simplification because of the consistency and efficiency they seek to achieve. These provisions generate extensive regulations that the following headings summarize:\n\u2022 privacy standards\n\u2022 security standards\n\u2022 identifier standards\n\u2022 transaction and code set standards\n\nPrivacy Standards\n\tPrivacy standards provide the first comprehensive federal protection for the privacy of personal health information. At the same time, many states have their own privacy rules and federal standards do not override those rules if they contain stricter provisions. The federal privacy standards extend protection to all PHI relating to physical or mental health condition, the provision of health care, or the payment for the provision of health care.\n\tThe standards give covered entities flexibility to design their own policies and procedures to meet the privacy requirements. Covered entities, however, generally have to adopt written procedures regarding certain privacy issues. These include who has access to protected information, how the entity will use PHI, and when the entity may disclose information. Covered entities must also train their employees in privacy procedures and designate a privacy officer who is responsible for ensuring that the employees follow the procedures.\n\tUnder the privacy standards, individuals have significant rights to control and understand how their health information is used. These rights include the following:\n\u2022 Providers and health plans must give patients and members a clear written explanation of how the covered entity may use and disclose health information.\n\u2022 Patients must be able to see and obtain copies of their health records and to make amendments. In addition, a history of nonroutine disclosures of personal health information must be available to patients.\n\u2022 Individuals must give a separate authorization for nonroutine and most nonhealthcare-related disclosures of their personal health information. The sale of patient health information for marketing purposes is an example of a disclosure requiring such an authorization. Individuals also have the right to request restrictions on the uses and disclosures of their information.\n\u2022 Individuals have the right to file a formal complaint with a covered provider or health plan, or with HHS, about violations of the privacy regulations or the policies and procedures of the covered entity.\n\tThe standards do allow use and disclosure of PHI without authorization for specified purposes. All other purposes require an individual's authorization. A covered entity must also establish an agreement with any business associate to which it discloses personal health information in the conduct of the covered entity's business.\n\nUse and Disclosure without Specific Authorization\n\tA covered entity may use or disclose PHI without written authorization for treatment, payment, or health care operations, or in other situations permitted by the privacy standards.\n\tTreatment, Payment, or Health Care Operations. Treatment includes the provision, coordination, and management of health care and related services by health care providers. Payment consists of a health plan's activities to obtain premium, determine or fulfill responsibilities for coverage and provision of benefits, and provide reimbursement for health care services to an individual. Payment also extends to the activities of a health care provider to obtain payment for services. However, recent legislation allows patients to pay for their services out-of-pocket and request nondisclosure of services for claim payment or other operational purposes. Health care operations covers a broad spectrum of administrative services that support or otherwise relate to the delivery of health care services including such insurance functions as underwriting, rating, and reinsurance. Covered entities are required to provide, upon the patient's request, an accounting of health information made through an electronic health record system for any of these purposes.\n\tOther Situations. The privacy standards allow disclosure of personal health information without an individual's authorization for several other purposes or situations that include the following:\n\u2022 informal situations in which the individual may be asked directly or has the opportunity to agree or object, such as in the case of a pharmacist dispensing a prescription to a person acting on the patient's behalf\n\u2022 incidental uses and disclosures such as when a health plan employee discusses a patient's health claim on the phone and may be overheard by another employee who is not authorized to handle personal health information\n\u2022 public interest and benefit activities such as research, public health and safety, and law enforcement\n\nAuthorized Use and Disclosure\n\tFor purposes other than those previously identified, a covered entity must request an individual's written authorization. Authorization is defined as a specific written permission from individuals to use and disclose their personal health information. Examples of situations that would require an individual's authorization are disclosures to an insurer for coverage purposes, to an employer of results of a preemployment physical, or to a pharmaceutical firm for its own marketing purposes. Although the standards do not dictate the specific form, an authorization must be in plain language and contain specific items among which are the information to be disclosed, persons disclosing and receiving the information, expiration date, and right to revoke the authorization.\n\tIn limited circumstances, a covered entity may condition treatment, payment, enrollment, or benefits on an individual's granting an authorization. For instance, a health plan may condition enrollment on an authorization to obtain personal health information to establish eligibility for enrollment or for underwriting or premium determination.\n\nBusiness Associate Agreements\nbusiness associate\n\tThe privacy standards not only require that a covered entity ensure compliance by its workforce, but they also contain requirements for agreements between a covered entity and its business associates. A business associate is a person or organization, other than a member of the covered entity's workforce, that performs services for a covered entity that involve PHI. These services may be legal, actuarial, accounting, consulting, data aggregation, management, administrative, accreditation, or financial functions.\n\tThe recent legislation requires noncovered entities such as health information exchanges, regional health information organizations, e-prescribing gateways, and personal health record vendors to have business associate agreements with covered entities for the electronic exchange of PHI. Perhaps, more significantly, HIPAA violations can now be enforced directly against business associates as well as covered entities.\n\tA covered entity's agreement with a business associate must do the following:\n\u2022 ensure that the business associate establishes safeguards to protect the confidentiality of, integrity of, and appropriate access to PHI\n\u2022 assure that the agents and subcontractors to whom the business associate provides PHI meet the same standards and report to the covered entity any security incident of which they become aware\n\u2022 authorize termination of the contract if the business associate commits a material violation of the privacy provisions\n\tThe privacy standards do not specifically mention agents and brokers, and the HHS has issued no guidance on their role under the standards. There seems to be a general (but not unanimous) consensus, however, that agents or brokers are business associates if they have access to PHI. As a result, covered entities may ask agents or brokers with whom they deal to sign a business associate contract.\n\nSecurity Standards\n\tThe security standards require covered entities to implement measures to maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for electronic PHI. These safeguards aim to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the PHI that a covered entity creates, receives, stores, or transmits. They must also protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the data and unauthorized use or disclosure of the information. Policies and procedures must effectively control physical access to the data and establish technical security measures to protect networks, computers, and other electronic devices. Business associate agreements as required by the privacy standards must also contain these safeguards.\n\tAlthough the scope of the security standards is limited to PHI in electronic form, the privacy standards, previously discussed, provide a security requirement for all PHI, regardless of form or medium.\n\nIdentifier Standards\n\tHistorically, providers, employers, and health plans have used nonstandard identification formats when conducting business with each other. Each physician, for example, has a different provider number with each insurer or health plan to which he or she submits claims. The identifier standards will ensure the use of uniform identifiers among these health care organizations in order to reduce errors, uncertainty, and duplication. The employer identification standard adopted for electronic transactions is an employer's tax identification number or employer identification number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service. Health care providers and health plans now have unique identifiers.\n\nTransaction and Code Set Standards\n\tStandard data elements and electronic processes are expected to promote cost effective, efficient, accurate, and prompt health care transactions. The transaction and code set standards apply to code systems for diagnosis and treatment as well as data fields and electronic formats for transmitting data. Transactions subject to the national electronic standards include health claims or claims status, patient encounters, benefit eligibility inquiries, enrollments and disenrollments, provider and premium payments, referral certifications and other authorizations, and related communications. Providers that use nonelectronic transactions with private health plans are not required to adopt and use the standards.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 725 - Health Benefits - HIPAA: Privacy of Medical Records\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released final regulations designed to secure the confidentiality of health plan participants' medical information. The final regulations extend privacy protection to all types of personal health information, including medical records and other individually identifiable health information, created or held by covered entities, including oral records and paper records that have not existed in electronic form. Covered entities include health plans (including employer-sponsored plans), health care clearing\u00ad houses, and health care providers.(Reference 1 below)\n\tProtected health information. With few exceptions, an individual's protected health information (PHI) can be used for health purposes only. This includes such things as health care treatment, payment, and operations. PHI is defined as all individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained by a covered entity, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally.(Reference 2 below) Health information cannot be used for purposes not related to health care, such as use by employers to make personnel decisions or use by financial institutions, without explicit authorization from the individual. Disclosures of information must be limited to the minimum necessary for the purpose of the disclosure. This rule does not apply to the transfers of medical records for treatment purposes because physicians and other providers need access to the full medical record.(Reference 3 below)\n\tNot all medical information kept by a company is protected PHI. Whether it is protected depends on whether an entity creates or receives the information in its role as an employer or in its role as a group health plan, and thus as a covered entity. For example, when an individual gives his or her medical information to the covered entity as the employer, such as when submitting a doctor's statement to document sick leave, or when the covered entity as employer obtains the employee's written authorization for disclosure of protected health information, such as an authorization to disclose the results of a fitness for duty examination, that medical information becomes part of the employment record, and, as such, is no longer protected health information. (Remember, though, that the covered entity as employer may be subject to other laws and regulations applicable to the use or disclosure of information in an employee's employment record).(Reference 4 below)\n\tHealth plan defined. A \"health plan\" includes any employee welfare benefit plan as defined under ERISA Sec. 3(1) (regardless of whether it is insured or self\u00adinsured) to the extent that the plans provide medical care, an HMO, a long-term care policy, an employee welfare benefit plan that provides health care to the employees of two or more employers, and any other individual or group health plan that provides or pays for the cost of medical care. Health FSAs are, therefore, covered by the privacy rule.(Reference 5 below)\n\tNotice requirements. The privacy rules require covered entities to provide patients with notice of the patients' privacy rights and the privacy practices of the covered entity, although this requirement is optional for health plans. The strengthened notice requires direct treatment providers to make a good faith effort to obtain patients' written acknowledgement of the notice of privacy rights and practices.(Reference 6 below)\n\tDisclosure of full medical record for treatment. For most disclosures, such as information submitted with bills, covered entities are required to send only the minimum information needed for the purpose of the disclosure. Under the final rules, however, providers are given full discretion to determine what personal health information to include when sending patients' medical records to other providers for treatment purposes.(Reference 7 below)\n\tRequired procedures. The final regulation establishes privacy safeguard standards that covered entities must meet but it leaves detailed policies and procedures for meeting these standards to the discretion of each covered entity. Covered entities must:\n\t\t\u25a1 Adopt written privacy procedures, including who has access to protected information, how it will be used within the entity, and when the information would or would not be disclosed to others. They must also take steps to ensure that their business associates protect the privacy of health information.\n\t\t\u25a1 Train employees and designate a privacy officer. Covered entities must provide sufficient training so that their employees understand the new privacy protection procedures and designate an individual to be responsible for ensuring the procedures are followed.\n\t\t\u25a1 Establish grievance processes. Covered entities must provide a means for patients to make inquiries or complaints regarding the privacy of their records.(Reference 8 below)\n\tPointer: The HHS generally does not consider facility redesigns, such as office space redesigns or computer system upgrades, as necessary to meet the reasonableness standard for minimum necessary uses. However, covered entities may need to make certain adjustments to their facilities to minimize access, such as isolating and locking file cabinets or records rooms, or providing additional security, such as passwords, on computers maintaining personal information.\n\tOral communications. According to the HHS, although covered entities must take reasonable safeguards to protect PHI, it is not expected that these safeguards guarantee the privacy of PHI from any and all potential risks. In determining whether safeguards are reasonable, HHS will take into account all the circumstances, including the potential effects on patient care and the financial and administrative burden of any safeguards. Covered entities will not be required to soundproof rooms, provide private rooms for each communication, or encrypt their telephones as long as reasonable safeguards, such as speaking with lowered voices, are taken. Also, the guidelines clarify that covered entities do not need to provide patients access to oral information.(Reference 9 below)\n\tMinimum necessary requirement. HIPM requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The rule requires that for all uses and many disclosures and requests for disclosures, covered entities implement policies and procedures for minimum necessary uses and disclosures. These policies and procedures will allow covered entities to avoid making a \"minimum necessary\" determination on a case-by-case basis. To allow covered entities the flexibility to address their unique circumstances, the rule requires covered entities to make their own assessment of what PHI is reasonably necessary for a particular purpose, given the characteristics of their business and workforce, and to implement policies and procedures accordingly.This is not a strict standard and covered entities need not limit information uses or disclosures to those that are absolutely needed to serve the purpose. Rather, this is a \n\treasonableness standard that calls for an approach consistent with the best practices and guidelines already used by many providers today to limit the unnecessary sharing of medical information.(Reference 10 below)\n\tPrivacy breaches. Privacy provisions for PHI set forth in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (ARRA) must be followed by both business associates and covered entities. A breach of privacy is defined in ARRA as unauthorized acquisition, access, or use, or disclosure of PHI which compromises security or privacy of PHI except where an unauthorized person would not reasonably have been able to retain PHI.(Reference 11 below)\n\tDefinition of ''breach.\" The term \"breach\" means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule that compromises the security or privacy of the PHl.(Reference 12 below) Compromising the security or privacy of the PHI means posing a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI constitutes a breach, covered entities and business associates will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is a significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. In performing the risk assessment, covered entities and business associates should consider the following factors:\n\t\t\u25a1 the type and amount of protected health information involved;\n\t\t\u25a1 who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;\n\t\t\u25a1 whether the covered entity took immediate steps to mitigate an impermissible use or disclosure; and\n\t\t\u25a1 whether PHI was returned prior to it being accessed for an improper purpose.(Reference 13 below)\n\t\n\tBreach exclusions. A breach does not occur in the following situations:\n\t\t1. any unintentional acquisition, access, or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a covered entity or a business associate if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule;\n\t\t2. any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a covered entity or business associate to another person authorized to access PHI at the same covered entity or business associate, or organized health care arrangement in which the covered entity participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule; and\n\t\t3. a disclosure of PHI where a covered entity or business associate has a good faith belief that an authorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.(Reference 14 below)\n\tExample: A billing employee receives and opens an e-mail containing PHI that a nurse mistakenly sent to the employee. The billing employee notices that he is not the intended recipient, alerts the nurse of the misdirected e-mail, and then deletes it. The billing employee's use of the information was done in good faith and within the scope of authority, and, therefore, would not constitute a breach and notification would not be required, provided the employee did not further use or disclose the information accessed in a manner not permitted by the Privacy Rule.\n\tExample: A receptionist at a covered entity who is not authorized to access PHI decides to look through patient files in order to learn of a friend's treatment. In this case, the impermissible access to PHI would not fall within the exceptions because such access was neither unintentional, done in good faith, nor within the scope of authority.\n\tExample: A covered entity, due to a lack of reasonable safeguards, sends a number of explanations of benefits (EOBs) to the wrong individuals. A few of the EOBs are returned by the post office, unopened, as undeliverable. In these circumstances, the covered entity can conclude that the improper addressees could not reasonably have retained the information. The EOBs that were not returned as undeliverable, however, and that the covered entity knows were sent to the wrong individuals, should be treated as potential breaches.\n\tBreach notice requirements. In instances of breach, ARRA requires notification of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed as a result of the breach. If a business associate discovers the breach, it must notify the covered entity, and a covered entity must make notification to the HHS no later than 60 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. In situations where a major breach covering the PHI of more than 500 individuals occurs, notice must be provided to prominent media outlets in the appropriate state or jurisdiction. Major breaches must be provided to the HHS immediately. Breaches covering fewer than 500 individuals require the covered entity to maintain a log of the breaches and submit it on an annual basis to the HHS.(Reference 15 below) The privacy rules require covered entities to provide patients with notice of the patient's privacy rights and the privacy practices of the covered entity, although this requirement is\noptional for health plans.(Reference 16 below) The strengthened notice requires direct treatment providers to make a good faith effort to obtain patient's written acknowledgment of the notice of privacy rights and practices.(Reference 17 below)\n\tHHS has clarified that the breach notification requirements only apply to unsecured PHI, which is PHI not secured through HHS-approved technology or guidance. In addition, once PHI is rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals by one or more HHS-approved method, such as encryption or destruction, then such information is not considered to be unsecured PH1.(Reference below)\n\tContent of breach notice. Final regulations require the breach notification to include, to the extent possible, the following elements:\n\t\t1. a brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;\n\t\t2. a description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code, or other types of information were involved);\n\t\t3. any steps individuals should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the breach;\n\t\t4. a brief description of what the covered entity involved is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals, and to protect against any further breaches; and\n\t\t5. contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which must include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, Web site, or postal address.(Reference 19 below)\n\tMethods of notification. A covered entity must provide breach notice to the individual in written form by first-class mail at the last known address of the individual. Written notice may be in the form of electronic mail, provided the individual agrees to receive electronic notice and such agreement has not been withdrawn.(Reference 20 below) Where the individual affected by a breach is a minor or otherwise lacks legal capacity due to a physical or mental condition, notice to the parent or other person who is the personal representative of the individual will satisfy these requirements. If an individual is deceased, such notice may be sent to either the individual's next of kin or personal representative.\n\tIf a covered entity does not have sufficient contact information for some or all of the affected individuals, or if some notices are returned as undeliverable, the covered entity must provide substitute notice for the unreachable individuals.(Reference 21 below) If there are fewer than 10 individuals for whom the covered entity has insufficient or out-of-date contact information to provide the written notice, the covered entity may provide substitute notice to such individuals through an alternative form of written notice, by telephone, or other means. If a covered entity has insufficient or out-of\u00ad date contact information for 10 or more individuals, the covered entity must provide substitute notice through either a conspicuous posting for a period of 90 days on the home page of its Web site or conspicuous notice in major print or broadcast media in geographic areas where the individuals affected by the breach likely reside.(Reference 22 below)\n\tNotification to the media. Covered entities must provide notice to prominent media outlets serving a state or jurisdiction following the discovery of a breach if the unsecured PHI of more than 500 residents of such state or jurisdiction is, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach. A covered entity must notify prominent media outlets without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.(Reference 23 below) Notification to the media must include the same information required to be included in the notification to the individual (see \"Content of breach notice\" discussion above) .(Reference 24 below)\n\tNotification to the HHS Secretary. Covered entities must notify the Secretary of breaches of unsecured PHI. For breaches involving 500 or more individuals, covered entities must notify the Secretary immediately and, at the same time, provide individual notification (as discussed above).(Reference 25 below) The notification must be provided in a manner to be specified on the HHS Web site. HHS will post instructions on its Web site for submitting this notification.(Reference 26 below)\n\tFor breaches involving less than 500 individuals, covered entities may maintain a log of such breaches and annually submit such log to the Secretary documenting the breaches occurring during the year involved.(Reference 27 below) The log must be submitted no later than 60 days after the end of each calendar year. The information must be provided to the Secretary in the manner specified on the HHS Web site. HHS will specify on its Web site the information to be submitted and how to submit such information.(Reference 28 below)\n\tNotification by a business associate. Following the discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI, a business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach no later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. (Reference 29 below) Business associates, to the extent possible, must provide covered entities with the identity of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached.(Reference 30 below)\n\tBusiness associates. The requirements that covered entities have under the HIPM privacy rule now apply directly to their business associates. Covered entities have to obtain satisfactory assurances through written agreements from their business associates who have access to protected health information that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information.(Reference 31 below) HHS has clarified, however, that a covered entity is not liable for privacy violations of a business associate and that covered entities do not have to actively monitor the means by which the business associate carries out safeguards. Business associate relation\u00ad ships arise when a covered entity has the right to use or disclose protected health information and another party is using that information to perform a function or activity on behalf of the covered entity. Members of a covered entity's workforce are not business associates and entities that share common ownership or control can be designated as one covered \nentity.(Reference 32 below)\n \n\tSome of the items that should appear in a business associate agreement include:\n\t\t\u25a1 ways the business associate is permitted to use PHI;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate follow appropriate safeguards;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate report PHI violations to the plan;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate return or destroy PHI when feasible; and\n\t\t\u25a1 a provision providing for termination of the agreement if a \"material breach\" occurs.(Reference 33 below)\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services included sample business associate contract provisions in the preamble of the privacy rule.\n\tDisclosure of enrollment information. The final rule allows a group health plan, a health insurance issuer, or HMO acting for a group health plan to disclose to a plan sponsor, such as an employer, information on whether the individual is enrolled in or has disenrolled from a plan offered by the sponsor without amending the plan documents.(Reference 34 below)\n\tIndividual rights. HIPPA also allows individuals to control, to some extent, how their protected health information will be used. For example, individuals have the right to:\n\t\t\u25a1 obtain a notice of how a covered entity will use and disclose their protected health information;\n\t\t\u25a1 request restrictions on the uses and disclosures of their protected health information for treatment, payment, and health care operations;\n\t\t\u25a1 request restrictions on the uses and disclosures for which neither a consent nor authorization is required;\n\t\t\u25a1 access, inspect and copy their health information;\n\t\t\u25a1 request an amendment to their health information; and\n\t\t\u25a1 request an accounting of disclosures of their protected health information. (Reference 35 below)\n\n\tPrivacy officers. To administer all of these rules, HIPM requires that covered entities designate a privacy officer. This privacy officer is responsible for the implementation and development of the entity's privacy policies and proce\u00ad dures. There must also be a person designated to receive complaints and provide information regarding privacy. This person may or may not be the privacy officer.(Reference 36 below)\n\tInternal policies and procedures. HIPM requires covered entities to implement policies and procedures with respect to PHI that are designed to comply with \"all the requirements of the HIPM privacy rule.\" (Reference 37 below)\n \n\tState laws. Stronger state laws, such as those covering mental health or AIDS information, continue to apply. The final rules set a national \"floor\" of privacy standards.\n\tPenalties. HIPAA provides civil and criminal penalties for covered entities that misuse personal health information. Civil monetary penalties for unintentional disclosures are $100 per incident, up to $25,000 per person, per year, per standard.\n\tFederal criminal penalties could be imposed for health plans, providers, and clearinghouses that knowingly and improperly disclose information or obtain information under false pretenses. Penalties would be higher for actions to generate financial gain. Criminal penalties are up to $50,000 and one year in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information (PHD; up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison for obtaining PHI under \"false pretenses\"; and up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for obtaining or disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer, or use it for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.(Reference 38 below)\n\tRevised civil penalties. Pursuant to a portion of ARRA called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), the penalties for noncompliance with the HIPAA privacy and data security requirements were increased. Under the HITECH Act, HHS is required to impose a civil monetary penalty for noncompliance due to willful neglect. The penalties apply to health plans, as well as business associates.(Reference 39 below)\n\tThe HIPAA civil monetary penalties have been adjusted as follows:(Reference 40 below)\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each pre-February 2009 violation of the HIPAA administrative simplification provision: $159 (up from $155), with a calendar year cap of $39,936 (up from $38,954).\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which a covered entity or business associate did not know and, by exercising reasonable diligence, would not have known that violation occurred: $117 minimum (up from $114), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which it is established that the violation was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect $1,170 minimum (up from $1,141), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which the violation was due to willful neglect and timely corrected (generally within 30 days): $11,698 minimum (up from $11,410), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which the violation was due to willful neglect, but not timely corrected: $58,490 minimum (up from $57,051), $1,754,698 maxi\u00ad mum (up from $1,711,533), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.11725\n \n\tIf HHS fails to act, the law allows state attorneys general to bring civil lawsuits to enforce penalties.(Reference 41 below)\n\tHITECH regulations. Final HHS rules strengthened and expanded enforcement of privacy, security, and enforcement rules in HIPM and the subsequently issued HITECH Act by implementing the following measures:\n\t\t1) expanded individuals' rights to access their information and to restrict certain types of disclosures of protected health information (PHD to health plans. Patients can ask for a copy of their electronic medical record in an electronic form;(Reference 42 below)\n\t\t2) required business associates of HIPM-covered entities to follow most of the same rules as the covered entities;\n\t\t3) set new limitations on the use and disclosure of PHI for marketing and fundraising;(Reference 43 below)\n\t\t4) prohibited the sale of PHI without patient authorization. Under the regulations, if a covered entity is to receive remuneration for the sale of PHI, it would have to include in the authorization a statement that the disclosure will result in remuneration to the covered entity.(Reference 44 below)\n\n\tThe final regulations also modified the individual authorization and other requirements to facilitate research and disclosure of child immunization proof to schools.(Reference 45 below), and.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.HHS Reg. \u00a7 160.103.\n2.

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - What is a Health Savings Account (HSA) and how does it work?\n\n\tHealth savings accounts are an alternative to standard group insurance plans. A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -  Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - Health Savings Accounts\n\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs)\n\n\tIn addition to providing prescription drug coverage for older Americans, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs are designed as successors to Archer MSAs, which are briefly discussed later, and the two have many features in common. However, they also have some notable differences that make HSAs more attractive than Archer MSAs and available to a much larger pool of consumers.\n\n\tHSAs were allowed as early as 2004. Various surveys indicate that by 2009 there were 6 to 7 million people with high-deductible health plans that met the criteria for them to also have HSAs. About three-quarters of these people have such health plans through employer-provided medical expense arrangements, but only about half of this group have either established HSAs or had their employers establish HSAs for them.\n\nGeneral Nature\n\n\tAn HSA is a personal savings account from which unreimbursed medical expenses, including deductibles, percentage participation, and copayments, can be paid. The HSA must be in the form of a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established in conjunction with a high-deductible health (medical expense) plan. An HSA is established with a qualified trustee or custodian in much the same way that an IRA is established. Any insurance company or bank (as well as certain other financial institutions) can be a trustee or custodian, as can any other person or entity already approved by the IRS as a trustee or custodian for IRAs.\n\n\tHSAs are individual trusts, which prohibits a husband and wife from having a joint HSA. But as long as both are eligible, each may have a separate HSA.\n\n\tSome insurers that sell high-deductible health plans for use with HSAs also market the HSA accounts; other insurers leave it to the purchasers of a high-deductible health plan to establish their HSAs with other institutions.\n\n\tEven though employers can sponsor HSAs, these accounts are established for the benefit of individuals and are portable. If an employee changes employers or leaves the workforce, the HSA, including the balance in the account, remains with the individual.\n\nEligibility\n\n\tEmployees, the self-employed, and anyone else can establish HSAs as long as they meet the following rules for qualification:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual must be covered by a high-deductible health plan. That plan may be insured or self-insured if offered by an employer as long as it meets the criteria for a qualifying high-deductible plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual is not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person's federal income tax return.\n\n\t\t\u2022 With some exceptions, a person who is covered under a high-deductible health plan is denied eligibility for an HSA if he or she is covered under another health plan that does not meet the definition of a high-deductible plan but that provides any benefits that are covered under the high-deductible health plan. The exceptions include coverage for accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care as well as liability insurance, insurance for a specified disease or illness, and insurance paying a fixed amount per period of hospitalization. Participation in a typical FSA would make an individual ineligible to participate in an HSA unless the FSA only provided reimbursement for types of expenses not covered under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\n\tAn employer can establish HSAs for its employees, or an individual (whether employed or not) may establish his or her own HSA.\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plan\n\n\tFor purposes of HSA participation, a high-deductible health plan is defined as having the following deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limitations for covered services. These figures are for 2012 and subject to annual inflation adjustments:\n\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of self-only coverage, the deductible must be at least $1,200, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $6,050.\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $12,100.\n\n\tIf these high-deductible plans use preferred-provider networks, they can have higher out-of-pocket limits for services provided outside the network, and any deductibles for nonnetwork services are not taken into account when determining the out-of-pocket limits specified above.\n\n\tOne point should be emphasized about the deductible for family coverage. It is not a family deductible as was described in the discussion on major medical insurance. In that situation, there is an individual deductible that\napplies to each family member as well as a separate deductible for the family. This is sometimes referred to as an embedded deductible, and the policy pays benefits for any family member once his or her deductible is satisfied, even if the family deductible is not yet met.\n\n\tIn the case of a high-deductible policy used with an HSA, there will usually not be an individual deductible if a policy is written for a family. Rather, there will be a single deductible-referred to as a common deductible-that must be satisfied before any benefits are payable, even if all claims are for one family member. It is permissible, however, to use an embedded deductible, but only if the individual deductible is equal to at least the required HSA family deductible of $2,400.\n\n\tThe following incurred expenses do not count toward the plan's required deductible and out-of-pocket limit:\n\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services not covered by the high-deductible health plan\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services received from nonnetwork health care providers, if the plan uses a preferred-provider network\n\t\t\u2022 amounts above a plan's reasonable allowable specific service maximums\n\t\t\u2022 amounts in excess of reasonable and customary fees \n\t\t\u2022 penalties for failure to obtain a plan-required certification\n\n\tNevertheless, copayments and required percentage participation count toward the out-of-pocket limit, even if the plan does not consider them as contributing toward the satisfaction of the deductible. In addition, the deductible amount counts towards the out-of-pocket limit. However, employee contributions paid for the coverage do not count.\n\nPreventive Care\n\n\tGenerally, a high-deductible health plan established in conjunction with an HSA cannot provide benefits before the deductible is satisfied, but there is an exception for benefits for preventive care. A high-deductible health plan may provide benefits for the following preventive care services before the insured satisfies the plan's required high deductible:\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual physicals, immunizations, and screening services\n\n\t\t\u2022 routine prenatal and well-child care\n\n\t\t\u2022 tobacco cessation programs and obesity weight-loss programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 employee-assistance, disease management, or wellness programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 treatment of a related condition that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive care service or screening, such as removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy\n\n\t\t\u2022 drugs or medications taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease before the disease manifests itself or to prevent the reoccurrence of a disease from which the person has recovered. An example is the drug treatment of high cholesterol to prevent heart disease, or the treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with medications to prevent a recurrence. Other prescription drugs that do not qualify under this exception remain subject to the plan's high deductible.\n\nPreventive care must be offered with no cost-sharing.\n\nContributions\n\n\tContributions to an HSA may be made solely by individuals who have such accounts. They may also be made by employers that provide their employees with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIndividual Contributions\n\n\tIndividuals often fund HSAs without employer contributions because they are not employees or because their employer makes no contribution to HSAs. Contributions must be in the form of cash, and they are deductible for federal income tax purposes even if the individual does not itemize deductions.\n\n\tThe maximum annual contribution to an HSA in 2012 is $3,100 if the account holder has self-only coverage and $6,250 if the account holder has family coverage. These amounts are subject to annual indexing for inflation. As a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the full maximum contribution is allowed even if it exceeds the policy deductible amount under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\tIf both a husband and wife establish an HSA and have family coverage (that is, a single policy covering both of them), they can allocate the maximum contribution in any way they determine. If they have separate policies, each is subject to the limits that apply to self-only coverage.\n\n\tIndividuals aged 55 or older are also permitted an additional annual catch-up contribution of up to $1,000. If both a husband and wife are aged 55 or older, the catch-up contribution is available to each of them only if they have separate HSAs.\n\n\tAnnual contributions can be made in a lump sum or spread out over time. However, the contributions for a specific tax year cannot be made before the tax year begins or after the taxpayer's original filing date (without extensions) for that tax year. For most individuals, this is the earlier of April 15 of the following year or the date a return is filed. This is similar to the rules for IRA contributions.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJack and Eva, a married couple, retired last year when they each reached age 56. They purchased a family medical expense policy with a $5,000 deductible, and Jack established an HSA. The maximum contribution to the HSA for 2012 is $7,250, which consists of the regular $6,250 limit and an additional catch-up amount of $1,000 for Jack.\n\n\tHowever, i\u00a3 they each established an HSA, they both would be eligible to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution to their own accounts. The$6,250 regular contribution could be allocated between the two accounts as they agree upon. The net effect is that the total HSA contributions would increase to $8,250.\n\n\tThey can make these contributions in one or more payments between January 1, 2012 and the date they file their 2012 tax return.\n\n\tIf an individual stops participating in an HSA during a tax year, the actual HSA contribution that can be deducted for the tax year is limited to 1/12 of the annual amount, as described previously, times the number of months that an individual is eligible for HSA participation. Until 2007, the same rule applied if an individual began participating in an HSA after January of the tax-year-only a proportionate contribution could be made. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act changed the rule as long as an individual is still eligible to participate in an HSA during the last month of a tax-year. In such a situation, the individual is allowed to make the full annual tax-deductible contribution for the year. However, if he or she fails to remain eligible for an HSA for at least 12 months thereafter (other than because of death or disability), the contribution for the prior year that is attributable to months when the account holder did not have an HSA is includible in gross income and subject to a 20 percent penalty tax.\n\n\tAn excess contribution occurs to the extent that contributions to an HSA exceed the tax-deductible limits or are made for an ineligible person. The account holder is subject to a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions (including those made by an employer) for each year these contributions are in an account. This excise tax can be avoided if the excess amount and any net income attributable to the excess amount are removed from the HSA prior to the last day prescribed by law, (including extensions) for filing the account holder's income tax return. The net income attributable to the excess contributions is included in the account holder's gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is made.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\tPaul, aged 55, is eligible for an HSA and has a self-only high-deductible policy. In January 2012, he made a contribution of $2,000 to the HSA. On July 1, Paul decided to cease being a self-employed freelance editor and become an employee of a magazine. He cancelled his previous medical expense policy and enrolled in his new employer's, which did not qualify as a high-deductible health plan. As a result, Paul's allowable HSA contribution for the year is only 6/12 of $3,000, or $1,500. He is now in the position of having made an excess contribution for the year. As long as he withdraws the other $500 plus any earnings on this amount before filing his 2012 tax return, he will avoid any adverse tax consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\tJane, aged 39, did just the opposite of Paul. She left her prior job with an employer and became a self-employed consultant. This occurred on November 1, 2012, when she dropped her former HMO coverage through the employer and purchased a high-deductible medical expense policy for herself and her son. She also established an HSA. She is eligible to make the full 2012 contribution of $6,250 and took it as a deduction on her 2012 tax return. However, if she does not continue to be covered under a high-deductible health plan through 2013, a portion of this amount will have to be included as taxable income for 2013.\n\nRoll-Over Contributions\n\n\tAn account balance from an Archer MSA can be rolled over to an HSA on a tax-free basis. Similarly, account balances from an existing HSA can be rolled over to a new HSA.\n\n\tThe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also allows certain other types of tax-free rollovers in specific circumstances. For example, an account holder who establishes an HSA is allowed a one-time rollover of funds from an HRA or health FSA. The amount of the rollover, which is in addition to any regular contribution for the year, is limited to the lesser of the balance in such an account on (1) September 21, 2006, or (2) the date of the rollover. If the account holder does not remain eligible to participate in an HSA for at least one year after the rollover, the amount of the rollover is included in income for tax purposes and subject to a penalty tax. Finally, an account holder may make a one-time-only rollover from an IRA. The amount of the rollover is limited to the tax-deductible HSA contribution for the year and reduces any regular contribution allowed.\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\n\tMany persons with HDHPs have their coverage under an employer-provided plan, and their employer may make contributions to the HSAs of employees. Employer contributions belong to the employee and are nonforfeitable. The employer might make the maximum annual contribution as previously described. However, it is also possible that the employer contribution will contribute a lower amount. In this case, an employee can make any remaining allowable contribution.\n\n\tAn employer that contributes to HSAs is subject to a nondiscrimination rule that requires the employer to make comparable contributions for all employees who have HSAs. Failure to comply with this rule subjects the employer to an excise tax. However, full-time employees and part-time employees (those working fewer than 30 hours per week) are treated separately. The comparability rule generally requires that the employer contribute either the same dollar amount for each employee or the same percentage of each employee's deductible under the health plan. However, it is permissible for an employer to make larger contributions for nonhighly-compensated employees than for highly compensated employees.\n\nHSA Account Growth\n\n\tUnused amounts in an HSA accumulate on a tax-free basis and carry over to subsequent years without limit. The size of an HSA balance carried over from prior years has no effect on a current year's contribution.\n\nDistributions from an HSA\n\n\tAn individual can usually take distributions from an HSA at any time, but the trust or custodial document may put reasonable restrictions on both the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. Generally, accounts are set up so that they can be accessed with debit cards or checks written by the account holder as an alternative to actually filing for reimbursement. The amount of the distribution can be any part or all of the account balance. Subject to some exceptions, distributions of both contributions and earnings are excludible from an account holder's gross income if used to pay medical expenses of the account holder and the account holder's legal spouse and tax dependents as long as these expenses are not paid by other sources of insurance. There is no requirement that these family members be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. If both a husband and wife have HSAs, the reimbursement for any family can come from either or both HSAs but together cannot exceed the amount of the unreimbursed expense.\n\n\tFor the most part, the eligible medical expenses are the same ones that would be deductible, ignoring the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation (10 percent in 2013), if the account holder itemized his or her income tax deductions. Tax-free withdrawals are permitted for the purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for the purchase of health coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation. They are also permitted for the purchase of long-term care insurance up to certain deductible limits. However, tax-free withdrawals are not otherwise permitted for the purchase of health insurance by persons under age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tEric has accumulated $6,000 in his HSA account during the last 3 years. Because hjs wife has medical expense coverage with her employer, Eric's high-deductible policy is for him only.\n\n\tIn February, Eric incurred his first medical expenses for the year when he severely sprained his wrist. He incurred $1,000 in medical expenses that were not covered under his policy because the $5,000 deductible had not been met. Eric can pay for these expenses with funds from his HSA.\n\n\tIn April, Eric had a routine eye examination that cost $120. This examination was not covered under his medical expense policy, but it qualifies as a medical expense for IRS purposes. Therefore, Eric can take a $120 tax-free distribution from his HSA.\n\n\tIn July, Eric's wife had a crown installed by her dentist. Her employer-provided health insurance paid only $600 of the dentist's bill. Eric can use his HSA to pay the remaining $400 because HSA funds can be used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses of an account holder's legal spouse. (Note that the IRS considers medical expenses to include charges for dental services.)\n\n\n\tEven though contributions cannot be made after an individual reaches age 65 and becomes a Medicare beneficiary, tax-free distributions can still be used for any future qualified medical expenses, which include premiums for original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage plans, and medical expense coverage under employer-sponsored plans. However, an account holder cannot use tax-free distributions to pay premiums for a Medicare supplement policy.\n\n\tFrom a financial planning standpoint, account holders may want to wait until after retirement or age 65 to take HSA distributions as long as they have the resources to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses prior to that time. This will allow their HSA balances to grow on a tax-favored basis for use in their older years when unreimbursed medical expenses may be higher and/or income may be lower.\n\n\tDistributions are permitted for other reasons, but they are subject to income taxation and possibly to a 20 percent penalty tax. However, the penalty tax does not apply in the case of distributions after an individual's death, disability, or the attainment of age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKirby has a balance of $7,000 in his HSA. At age 67, he rediscovered his childhood sweetheart and fell madly in love. She agreed to marry him and he wants to give her a big diamond ring. Because she told Kirby that she would take care of him for life, he decided to cash in his HSA and apply the proceeds to purchase the ring. His tax accountant informed Kirby that this arrangement would not be a qualified medical expense. He can withdraw the funds without penalty because he is at least age 65, but the $7,000 must be included in his gross income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\n\tFormer employees, including retirees, may continue HSAs that were established prior to termination of employment, and the rules for contributions and distributions are as previously described.\n\n\tRetirees who did not have an HSA prior to retirement can establish one at that time as long as all the proper rules are satisfied. Such an HSA may present an opportunity for a retiree to reduce income taxes. However, the requirement of having a high-deductible plan will probably negate this advantage if an individual has substantial medical expenses.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKathleen, a widow, retired at age 60 from her job as an attorney. She likes the concept of consumer-directed health plans and has decided to establish an HSA. In order to be eligible for the HSA, she purchased a major medical policy with an annual deductible of $2,500. She plans to make the maximum allowable contribution to the HSA until she is eligible for Medicare. She will then use her HSA balance to pay her Medicare premiums.\n\n\tThere are fees involved in establishing an HSA. These fees may affect any potential tax advantages if an HSA is established near the time of Medicare enrollment.\n\nEstate Tax Treatment of HSAs\n\n\tUpon death, the remaining balance in an HSA is includible in the account holder's gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the account is a surviving spouse, the HSA belongs to the spouse and he or she can deduct the account balance in determining the account holder's taxable estate. The surviving spouse can then use the HSA for his or her medical expenses. If the beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, the HSA ceases to exist, and the beneficiary must include the fair market value of the account in his or her gross income for tax purposes. If no beneficiary is named, the tax is payable by the estate or the beneficiary of the estate.\n\nEstablishing and Maintaining HSAs\n\n\tThere are a number of issues that need to be evaluated by an individual who has the option to establish an HSA. Perhaps the most important question is whether such an account is appropriate. After a person decides to establish an HSA, issues such as account fees, investment options for funds, and record keeping must be addressed.\n\nAppropriateness of HSAs\n\n\tFor some persons, an HSA is very appropriate and offers significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities. For other persons, an HSA may not be an attractive financial commitment. An HSA's viability depends on individual circumstances such as income, tax rates, the funds available to fund such an account, when account balance will be withdrawn, earnings on account funds, and account fees. Some of these issues are addressed in the following example.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJohn and his wife, both aged 50, no longer have any dependent children. They are self-employed and have a joint income of $150,000. For the last few years, they have had an HSA-compatible policy with a $5,000 deductible, but have not established HSAs. They are in good health and have paid aU unreimbursed medical expenses from current income. Their financial advisor has suggested that one or both of them should establish an HSA. They have decided to do so, and make an annual contribution of $5,000, which is an affordable financial commitment. This will result in an annual income tax savings of $1,300 (based on IRS estimates). They have also decided to continue paying any unreimbursed medical expenses from current income and to let the HSA funds accumulate until they retire at age 65. They plan on investing the funds and expect them to grow at about 5 percent per year. If this return is achieved, they will have a fund of about $100,000 when they retire. They will then withdraw amounts as needed on a tax-free basis to pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nAccount Fees\n\n\tOne factor that varies widely among financial institutions that offer HSAs is the fees that they charge. If an individual uses an HSA that has been established by his or her employer, the employer may pay some of these fees. But no matter how an account is established, a potential account holder should look at the fees and their impact on the account balance. Unfortunately, this is not always easy to do. Although financial institutions often have information about their HSAs on Web sites or in print, the fee structure is often conspicuously absent or hard to locate. Unlike other types of financial products, such as IRAs, there are no requirements to provide potential account holders with\na prospectus that details the fees. Therefore, it is often necessary to ask specific questions. As the next example demonstrates, these fees may have an effect on the decision to establish an HSA. Even if an HSA is an obvious choice, the account balance will be affected by the fee structure.\n\n\tHSA fees fall into several categories that might include one or more of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 account setup fee. This is a one-time fee to establish the HSA. Such fees typically range from $0 to $50, with $15 or $20 being common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual fee. An HSA may have an annual fee that ranges up to $200, but amounts of $10 to $20 are most common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 monthly maintenance fee. An HSA may have a monthly maintenance fee that ranges up to $10, but amounts like $2 to $3 seem most common. Although there may be both a monthly maintenance fee and an annual fee, this is very uncommon; there is usually one or the other. In either case, the amount of the fee may be lower for higher account balances.\n\n\t\t\u2022 transaction fee. An HSA may have a fee that is levied on each transaction. The fee may apply to contributions, but is most likely to be levied on withdrawals only. Fees may be as high as $5, but $.25 to $.50 are quite common. Sometimes a few transactions are allowed without a fee, but fees are levied on transactions in excess of this number.\n\n\t\t\u2022 account closing fee. It is not unusual for an HSA to have an account closing fee that can range up to $25 or $30, although $10 is a more common amount.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tAmber is an administrative assistant who earns about $40,000 annually. She has an employer-provided medical expense policy with a $2,500 deductible. Her employer has not set up HSAs for employees and makes no HSA contributions. Amber enjoys traveling and what money she has left is being saved for a new car that she hopes to buy within the next 2 years. Amber is healthy and incurs about $500 in unreimbursed medical expenses annually. This typically includes two doctor's visits and quarterly refills of a prescription drug. To minimize her taxes, Amber decides toestablish an HSA. She plans on putting the $500 into an HSA account and taking a withdrawal each time she incurs an unreimbursed medical expense. This will lower her taxes by about $75. When she looks into establishing such an account with her local bank, she finds that they have an account setup fee of $15. There is also a $2 monthly maintenance fee ($24 per year) and a $3 fee for each withdrawal ($18 for her six transactions). Therefore, she will incur expenses of $57 to save $75 the first year. When Amber finds out that her account balance will be too small to earn more than 1 percent interest, she decides that an HSA is not worth the administrative hassle for such a minimal tax savings.\n\nInvestment Options for HSA Funds\n\n\tFinancial institutions often offer several types of investment options for HSA funds. Account holders can invest HSA funds in essentially the same manner as IRA funds. Allowable investments include bank accounts, annuities, certificates of deposit, stocks, mutual funds, and bonds. Investments in life insurance policies or most types of collectibles are prohibited. In addition, an HSA trust or custodial agreement may limit the investment options available.\n\n\tAlthough mutual funds and stocks may result in the best return over a number of years, they are probably unsuitable if an account holder has modest amounts in an HSA that will be used for medical expenses in the near future. Like many types of investments, they will fluctuate in value over time. Such investments may also be unavailable unless an account holder has an account balance of several thousand dollars. The prior example regarding John under the heading Appropriateness shows when such an investment makes sense.\n\n\tIn most cases, an individual will be using some type of bank account that allows easy access to the available funds. In this case, it is important to evaluate the return that these funds will earn, which is set by each bank. In some cases, nothing is paid unless the account exceeds a minimum balance, such as $1,000. Interest rates may also vary by the size of the account's average daily balance. In still other cases, a specified interest rate, which can change, is paid on any size balance. Even with these variations, there are significant differences among banks.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\tCustodians and trustees for HSAs report the amount of annual contributions to and distributions from each HSA to the IRS. Under IRS rules, it is the account holder's responsibility to determine whether distributions from HSAs are for eligible medical expenses. Therefore, individuals who establish such accounts should maintain records in case they are audited. They should also become familiar with the types of expenses that are deductible. Guidance can be found in IRS Publication 502, which is available on the IRS Web site: irs.gov."

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? \n\n\tA medical Flexible Spending Account (also known as a flexible spending arrangement or FSA) is a special account that an employee can put pre-tax money into to pay for certain out-of\u00adpocket health care costs not covered by insurance. Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2200 - Flexible Spending Accounts - Flexible Spending Accounts Defined\n\nFlexible spending accounts (FSAs) have become a large part of the cafeteria plan picture.\n\nPointer: FAS/' FACJ'S about flexible spending accounts\n\nFSAs can be used to \"pre-fund\" health care or dependent care expenses in pre-tax dollars. Generally, an employee is not entitled to recover any unused amounts in the FSA at the end of the year, however.\n\nA health care FSA cannot be used to pay for other health care insurance premiums.\n\nDependent care assistance FSAs are limited to $5,000 per year. In 2020, the maximum limit on salary reduction contributions to health care FSAs is $2,750.\n \nUse of FSAs\n\n\tAn FSA provides an account in an employee's name that is used to reimburse the employee for certain personal expenses (see KB-1 Topic 2250). They are provided by employers as a way for employees to pre-fund dependent care, medical, or dental expenses in pre-tax dollars (see KB-1 Topic 2210). Health care spending accounts (see KB-1 Topic 2215) and dependent care spending accounts (see KB-1 Topic 2270) are subject to special rules and limits.\n\n\tEnrollment form. An employee wishing to participate in an FSA must\ncomplete an enrollment form. Amounts placed into the FSA are deducted from the employee's paycheck (see KB-1 Topic 2265).\n\n\tTax treatment If the FSA is \"forfeitable\" (that is, if the employee does not have the right to receive any of the unused amounts left in the account at the end of the year), the reimbursements made through the account are excluded from the employee's taxable income (see KB-1 Topic 2240).\n\nPointer: IRS proposed regulations relate to the administration of cafeteria plans and the benefits that can be offered as a part of a cafeteria plan as well as flexible spending accounts (FSAs). The proposed regulations incorporate changes made by legislation since previous proposed regulations were drafted. The regulations also consolidate and withdraw prior proposed regulations. The rules contained in the proposed regulations are substantially unchanged from the withdrawn proposed regulations, with only minor changes to reflect legislation and for clarification. The withdrawn proposed regulations were organized in question-and-answer format, but the current proposed regulations have abandoned that format. The proposed regulations may be relied on for guidance pending the issuance of final regulations.\n\nProp. Reg. \u00a71.125-5 contains the rules for the inclusion of an FSA in a cafeteria plan. The regulations retair1 the uniform coverage and use-or-lose rules and include the general requirements of a qualified FSA plan. The proposed rules also retain the forfeiture allocation rules in the prior proposed regulations and clarify that the employer sponsoring the cafeteria plan may retain forfeitures, use forfeitures to defray expenses of administering the plan or allocate forfeitures among employees contributing through salary reduction on a reasonable and uniform basis.\n\n\tLevels of coverage. A single FSA may provide participants with different levels of coverage and different maximum amounts of reimbursements.\n\nExample 1: An employer with 1,000 employees maintains a cafeteria plan under which the employees may elect several benefit options, including insured health plans and HMOs. The plan provides that the required premiums or contributions for the benefits are to be made by salary reduction. Even though the plan may characterize employees' premium payments and other contributions as flexible spending contributions or credits, the operation of a cafeteria plan to permit employees' contributions to be made on a salary reduction basis does not, standing alone, cause the plan (or any benefit thereunder) to be treated as an FSA.\n \nExample 2: An employer with 1,000 employees maintains a cafeteria plan under which the employees may elect, among other benefits, a level of coverage under an arrangement that will reimburse medical expenses incurred during a year up to the specified amount elected by the employee. The maximum amount of reimbursement that can be deducted for a year is $2,750. Because each employee's premium for such coverage is equal to the maximum reimbursement amount selected by the employee, this arrangement is a health FSA.\n\nReimbursements for transit expenses\n\n\tThe IRS has approved final regulations governing reimbursement accounts that cover certain employee transportation expenses. These reimbursements must be\u2022 made under a \"bona fide reimbursement arrangement.\" The arrangements resemble FSAs in the way that the benefits may be provided under compensation reduction arrangements and the employee must provide proof that he or she incurred the expense prior to receiving reimbursement of the expense (Reference 1 below). These reimbursement accounts constitute qualified transportation fringe benefits under Code Sec. 132 and should 'not be confused with health FSAs or dependent care FSAs under Code Sec. 125.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFor a discussion of tax treatment of flexible spending accounts, see KB-1 Topic 2285.\n\nFor a discussion of qualified transportation fringe benefits, see KB-1 Topic 3350.\n\nFor more information, see KB-1 Topic 39,150 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n\n1 IRS Reg. \u00a7\u00a71.132-5 and 1.132-9.\n"

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Preferred-Provider Organizations\n\n\tA concept that continues to receive considerable attention from employers and insurance companies is the preferred-provider organization. A few PPOs existed on a small scale for many years, but since the early 1980s PPOs have grown steadily in number and in membership. Today, PPOs provide coverage for medical expenses to more Americans than do HMOs, primarily because of the flexibility of covered persons to choose their own medical providers.\n\nWhat Is a PPO?\npreferred-provider organization (PPO)\n\tThe term preferred-provider organization (PPO) tends to be used in two ways. One way is to apply it to health care providers that contract with employers, insurance companies, union trust funds, third-party administrators, or others to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. Using this definition, a PPO may be organized by the providers themselves or by other organizations, such as insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, or employers. Like HMOs, they may take the form of group practices or separate individual practices. They may provide a broad array of medical services, including physicians' services, hospital care, laboratory costs, and home health care, or they may be limited only to hospitalization or physicians' services. Some of these organizations are very specialized and provide specific services, such as dental care, mental health benefits, substance abuse services, maternity care, or prescription drugs. This book refers to these providers not as PPOs but as preferred providers or network providers.\n\tThe second use of the term PPO, and the one generally assumed when the term is used throughout this book, is to apply it to benefit plans that contract with preferred providers to obtain lower-cost care for plan members. PPOs typically differ from HMOs in several respects. First, the PPO generally pays the preferred providers on a fee-for-service basis as their services are used. However, fees are usually subject to a schedule that is the same for all similar providers within the provider network, and providers may have an incentive to control utilization through bonus arrangements. Second, employees and their dependents are not required to use the practitioners or facilities that contract with the PPO; rather, they can make a choice each time medical care is needed, and the PPO also pays benefits for care provided that nonnetwork providers furnish. However, employees have incentives to use network providers; they include lower or reduced deductibles and copayments as well as increased benefits, such as preventive health care. Third, most PPOs do not use a primary care physician as a gatekeeper; employees do not need referrals to see specialists.\n\tEmployers were disappointed with some of the early PPOs. Although discounts were available to members, they seemed to have little effect on benefit costs because discounts were from higher-than-average fees, or providers were more likely to perform diagnostic tests or prolong hospital stays to generate additional fees to compensate for the discounts. These PPOs seldom lasted long. Successful PPOs today emphasize quality care and utilization review. In selecting physicians and hospitals, PPOs look both at the type of care provided and the provider's cost effectiveness. In this era of fierce competition among medical care providers, these physicians and hospitals are often willing to accept discounts in hopes of increasing patient volume. It is also important for a PPO to monitor and control utilization on an ongoing basis and to deal with groups of preferred providers that monitor their own costs and utilization. Generally, however, PPOs do not monitor their preferred providers as closely as HMOs do.\n\nVariations\n\tOver time, PPOs have continued to evolve. A few PPOs compensate providers on a capitation basis, and a few others perform a gatekeeper function. If a member's primary care physician does not recommend a specialist, PPO benefits may be reduced. With these changes, it is sometimes difficult to determine the exact form of a managed care organization. However, those that operate as traditional HMOs generally provide medical expense coverage at a slightly lower cost than do those that operate as traditional PPOs, but there are wide variations among HMOs as well as among PPOs. Therefore, a careful analysis of quality of care, cost, and financial stability is necessary before the selection of a particular HMO or PPO.\n\nexclusive-provider organization (EPO)\n\tAnother variation of the PPO is the exclusive-provider organization, or EPO. The primary difference is that an EPO does not provide coverage outside the preferred-provider network, except in emergencies and those infrequent cases when the network does not contain an appropriate specialist. This aspect of an EPO makes it very similar to an HMO. The number of EPOs is small.\n\nSponsorship\n\tInsurance companies and the Blues established most of the early PPOs to provide products to compete with HMOs. In the early part of this decade, the number of PPOs grew significantly to over 1,000. However, primarily because of mergers, the number has decreased. The majority are still owned by insurance companies and the Blues. Some are owned by HMOs to give them another product in their health plan portfolios to offer employers. Others have a variety of ownership forms, including third-party administrators, private investors, and groups of physicians and/or hospitals.\n\nBenefit Structure\ncenters of excellence\n\tThe basic benefit structure of a PPO is very similar to that of the traditional comprehensive major medical contract. The most significant difference is that there is a higher level of benefits for care received from network providers than there is for care received from nonnetwork providers. Many PPOs have extensive networks of preferred providers, particularly in the geographic areas in which they operate, and there is little reason to seek care outside the network. Some of these PPOs also have reciprocity agreements elsewhere with networks of other PPOs and hospitals (called centers of excellence) that have excellent outcomes and reputations for certain types of medical procedures, such as cancer treatment, organ transplants, or burn treatment. Under these agreements, the PPO pays benefits as if a member receives care from network providers. Other PPOs have more limited networks, and the need and desire for treatment from nonnetwork providers is greater.\n\tThe level of benefits under PPOs may vary because of differences in deductibles, coinsurance, and precertification rules. There may also be a few additional benefits that are available only if a member receives care from a network provider. Finally, the procedures for filing claims also differ. The major purpose of these differences is to encourage an employee or dependent to receive care from preferred providers who agree to charge the plan a discounted fee.\n\nDeductibles\n\tA PPO may have annual deductibles that apply separately to network and nonnetwork charges. For examples, these might be $500 and $1,000, respectively. However, some PPOs have no deductible for network charges. A PPO may waive deductibles for some medical services, such as emergency services.\n\nCoinsurance\n\tPPOs often use coinsurance percentages that are 20 percent (and occasionally 30 percent) lower when a member receives care from nonnetwork providers. A frequently found provision applies 90 percent coinsurance to network charges and 70 percent coinsurance to nonnetwork charges. Coinsurance provisions of 100/80, 90/80, 100/70, and 80/60 are also commonly used. As with deductibles, a PPO may waive the percentage participation for certain medical services. In addition, different stop-loss limits or coinsurance caps, such as $1,000 and $3,000, may apply to network and nonnetwork charges.\n\tAlthough PPOs typically have higher coinsurance percentages for network charges than do traditional major medical plans, a covered person may be responsible for copayments in some circumstances. For example, there might be a copayment, typically ranging from $10 to $25, for each a visit to a primary care physician.\n\nallowable charge\n\tIn evaluating PPOs, it is important to determine the basis the PPO uses to apply the coinsurance percentage. For example, assume a plan uses 80 percent coinsurance for nonnetwork charges and that a charge of $100 is incurred for a medical procedure from a nonnetwork provider. Most PPOs first determine whether this charge is usual, customary, and reasonable. If it is, the plan pays $80. If the plan determines that the usual, customary, and reasonable charge is $90, it will be 80 percent of that amount, or $72. However, some plans apply the coinsurance percentage to what they often refer to as an allowable charge. In most cases, this is the amount that the PPO pays to network providers for the same procedure. In some cases, network discounts are quite large and, for example, the allowable charge in this example might be only $60. For a nonnetwork charge, the plan pays 80 percent of this amount, or $48. Thus the insured has an out-of-pocket expense of $52. Few employees and their families will seek nonnetwork care under this type of plan. For this reason, plans that pay nonnetwork charges on this basis are sometimes referred to as phantom PPOs.\n\nPrecertification Rules\n\tPPOs often have precertification requirements for many types of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, and medical supplies. For network benefits, the person responsible for obtaining the needed certification is the network provider, and the PPO does not penalize a member if the network provider fails to obtain the proper precertification. (This becomes an issue between the PPO and the provider.) However, this responsibility shifts to the employee or family member for nonnetwork services. If he or she does not obtain a required precertification, there usually is a reduction in benefits. For example, what was once 80 percent coinsurance might shrink to 60 percent.\n\nAdditional Network Benefits\n\tFor the most part, PPOs pay benefits for the same medical procedures, whether a network or a nonnetwork provider performs them. However, some PPOs cover a few procedures only if a member receives them from network providers.\n\nClaims\n\tNo claim forms are required for network services. The covered person merely pays any required copayment, and the provider of medical services does the paperwork needed to receive the additional amounts payable by the plan. Just as in traditional major medical plans, it is the ultimate responsibility of the covered person to file the claims forms necessary to receive benefits for nonnetwork care. Of course, the provider may do much of the paperwork and accept an assignment of benefits.\n\nExample\nThe following table shows excerpts of the benefit structure from a sample PPO.\n\nTable 9-2 Selected Benefits under a Sample PPO\n\tNetwork Benefit\tNonnetwork Benefit\nDeductible\tNone\t$500 per person per year.

In fact, they were largely unregulated. As a result, the NAIC created the Preferred Provider Arrangements Model Act, which the majority of states adopted. The act is relatively brief and establishes only a minimal regulatory framework. The act requires that PPOs incorporate cost-containment mechanisms, such as utilization review, to determine whether a service is medically necessary. Covered persons must have reasonable access to medical services. The act also allows PPOs to provide incentives for persons to use the preferred-provider network and to place limitations on the number and types of providers with whom they contract.\n\tNote that most PPO contracts also meet the definition of insurance and are subject to the same regulation by state insurance departments as traditional insurance contracts with respect to contract provisions and benefit mandates.\n\n\n \n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - The Evolution of Hospital/Medical Plan Designs\n           \nHospital medical plans have evolved over the years.\n\nPrepayment Service and Indemnity Plans\n           Because the primary distinction between original prepayment and insured indemnity products was whether the benefit coverages were stipulated as a set level of benefits or an indemnified dollar amount to cover a certain amount of benefit, these two types of plans are described together.\n\nHospitalization Coverage: The Early Days\n           Insurance that covered hospital stays was traditionally obtainable as a stand-alone product separate from insurance for medical services. Although medical benefit insurance has evolved into a more comprehensive product that covers hospital stays, physician services, and other medical expenses, it is still useful to examine the separate components.\n\n           The Blue Cross/Blue Shield organizations played a dominant role in the emergence of these early plans, setting up separate entities to handle hospital insurance and medical care insurance. Their hospital insurance products were configured as prepayment plans in which benefits were set in terms of allowable days of hospitalization. These plans emerged in the early 1930s. They contracted with hospitals and reimbursed them directly for patient lengths of stay. The Blue Cross organizations provided insurance to all policy seekers under their own charter. Insurance companies entered the marketplace soon thereafter but provided a hospital-day benefit that was based on a fixed dollar figure, which was the amount for which the insurance company indemnified the subscriber. This dollar figure was calculated based on the expected cost of the hospitalization. While the Blue Cross organizations were nonprofit entities, the insurance companies were for-profit organizations, were not community rated, and were not open to all those seeking coverage.\n            The early hospitalization plans were configured as first-dollar plans, in which benefits were paid from the first dollar of expense incurred, and the subscriber did not incur any expense with the hospitalization. This first-dollar coverage was in keeping with the model of a prepayment plan and was doable because the cost and utilization patterns for medical care were quite different from what they are today. Many of these plans, par\u00ad ticularly the Blue Cross plans, were underwritten by community rating, an insurance approach whereby a uniform rate is used for all subscribers or insureds within a given geographical area.\n\nHospitalization Benefits: Further Development\n            The hospitalization portion of the pre-health-care-reform (2010) plans generally has covered all services, supplies, and procedures provided and billed through a hospital. These included the following:\n\u25a0 Inpatient room and board. This benefit usually covered hospital charges for a semiprivate room and board and other necessary services and supplies.\n\u25a0 Emergency care for services obtained at a hospital emergency room.\n\u25a0 Intensive and specialty care.\n\u25a0 Maternity and required associated newborn care for a set number of days or a stipulated dollar amount.\n\u25a0 X-ray, diagnostic testing, and laboratory expenses when the insured was hospital-confined or when these services were performed by a hospital on either an inpatient or outpatient basis.\n\u25a0 Skilled nursing facility care. A plan would pay for confinement in a skilled nursing facility if it met prescribed requirements. Usually, there was a daily limitation either on a yearly basis or per confinement. Historically, a hospital stay of at least three consecutive days immediately prior to confinement was required to trigger allowance for skilled nursing facility care. Many plans have eliminated this prior hospitalization requirement.\n\u25a0 Radiation and chemotherapy. This benefit typically covered materials and their preparation, as well as use of hospital facilities.\n\u25a0 Inpatient mental and nervous care.\n\u25a0 Inpatient drug and alcohol substance abuse care.\n\u25a0 Physical, inhalation, and cardiac therapy.\n\u25a0 Home health care. This benefit was provided for a specific number of visits per year by physicians, nurses, and home health aides. Care usually had to be under a treatment plan supervised by a home health agency.\n\u25a0 Hospice care. This benefit was provided when the subscriber's attending physician certified that the subscriber had a terminal illness with a limited medical prognosis, in many plans six months or less. This type of care allowed the subscriber to receive care primarily at home, to help relieve pain and provide comfort rather than curing the patient. Hospice care typically allowed for admission into a hospice facility, and benefits would usually be provided until the earlier of either a patient's death or discharge from a hospice.\n\u25a0 Respite care. Coupled with hospice care, this benefit allowed the terminal patient short-term inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility or member hospice when it was necessary to relieve primary caregivers in the patient's home. An example of this benefit might be an allowance of seven days every six months.\n          Under a major medical plan (described below) when allowances for hospitalization services were exceeded by a plan participant, the excess charges typically flowed to the major medical component of the plan where the plan reimbursed the participant after he or she paid the applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts.\n\nMedical/Service Coverage: The Early Days\n          Just as Blue Cross provided hospital insurance coverage, Blue Shield provided for insured medical care, including physician and other health care provider expenses. Similar to Blue Cross, the Blue Shield plans were service-type plans, which provided a limit on the services covered rather than a strict dollar indemnification. Blue Shield plans followed the creation of the Blue Cross hospitalization plans. The insurance companies that followed Blue Shield into the marketplace provided indemnification to the subscriber up to certain dollar amounts for covered medical services.\n\nMedical/Service Benefits: Further Development\n         The medical/service benefits paralleled the benefits provided under the earlier medical/service plans. The medical/surgical portion of these plans covered most services of health care practitioners. Their fees were reimbursed either on a scheduled fee basis or on a \"reasonable and customary (R&C) basis.\" A scheduled fee basis provided a maximum allowance for itemized procedures in terms of either a flat dollar amount or a unit value per procedure, which was then multiplied by a conversion dollar amount. The reasonable and customary basis was reimbursement based on the individual practitioner's customary charge for the procedure and the charges made by peer physicians in the given geographic area. Typically, \"reasonable and customary\" covered the equivalent of the full charge of 75 percent to 90 percent of all physicians within a geographic region. The plan then reimbursed the lesser of the individual practitioner's charge or the reasonable and customary fee. The advantage to a medical/surgical plan that paid on an R&C basis was that, unlike a scheduled fee plan, it was not necessary to amend the medical plan to account for medical inflation. However, in times of dramatic medical inflation, an insurer might not update the reasonable and customary database as frequently to exercise some restraint on price escalation.\n        The following services were typically covered in the medical/surgical insurance component:\n\u25a0 Surgeons\n\u25a0 Anesthesiologists\n\u25a0 Nurses and other surgical assistants\n\u25a0 Service fees associated with inpatient medical care\n\u25a0 Second surgical opinions\n\u25a0 X-ray, diagnostic, and laboratory expense benefits made in a doctor's office or by an independent laboratory\n\u25a0 Skilled nursing care\n\u25a0 Obstetricians and pediatricians associated with prenatal, delivery, and postnatal care\n\u25a0 Inpatient intensive care and concurrent care in a hospital\n\u25a0 Allergy testing\n\u25a0 Transplant services\n\u25a0 The administration of radiation and chemotherapy\n\u25a0 Inpatient physical therapy\n\u25a0 Immunizations for children\n         An insurer could contract with physicians and other health care practitioners to establish fees for services. This agreement with physicians was common practice in the past with Blue Shield plans. With these plans, in agreeing to be a \"participating doctor,\" the physician would agree to accept as payment in full, Blue Shield's usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) fee. Thus, the doctor agreed that he or she would not balance bill the plan participant an additional amount if the doctor's fee was higher than the fee assigned by Blue Shield. The benefit that the doctor received for being a participating provider with Blue Shield was that she or he would be paid directly and would not have to seek collection from the individual patient. Most physicians were participating providers with Blue Shield.\n        If, on the other hand, the plan participant were to receive medical services from a \"nonparticipating\" doctor, the basic component of the plan might reimburse the participant a dollar amount that was less than the doctor's charge. In this case, the participant could often submit the excess billed amount to the supplemental major medical portion of the plan and receive a second level of reimbursement after paying the required deduct\u00ad ible and coinsurance amounts required on the major medical insurance component of the plan.\n         As managed care organizations have become the predominant health plan providers, they have been able to exert greater influence over physician fee arrangements.\n\nMajor Medical Coverage: The Early Days\n          The third component that was joined with hospitalization and medical service to comprise traditional plans was supplemental major medical insurance. Major medical insurance was characterized by high limits of coverage; it was not typically written as first-dollar coverage but involved reasonable up-front deductibles and coinsurance. Two of the earliest attempts at health care cost containment-deductibles and coinsurance amounts-were two distinct methods of cost sharing with plan participants. The deductible was and is an amount of eligible covered medical expense that the insured subscriber must incur before the plan pays benefits. The rationale for a deductible is to lower plan costs. Coinsurance is another means by which plan participants share in the cost of their medical care. After an insured participant exceeds his or her deductible, the plan reimburses at less than 100 percent. This cost-sharing device ensures that the insured participant has a financial stake in the cost of medical care. The major medical insurance policy was written as \"all-except\" coverage rather than as \"named peril\" coverage, which specifically identified the services that were covered. Major medical coverage included a widely defined array of medical expenses, and named those services or medical items that were either limited in or precluded from coverage. A major medical policy could also be issued as a stand-alone policy, which was prevalent when this type of coverage was first introduced.\n\n\nMajor Medical Benefits: Further Development\n          The supplemental major medical portion of plans covered eligible expenses that may not have been covered in full or that were specifically excluded from either the basic hospitalization or the basic medical/surgical portions of the plan. Typically, these charges included the following:\n\u25a0 Excess hospitalization charges if the limit for services or a dollar amount on the hospitalization portion of the plan was exceeded\n\u25a0 Excess medical/surgical expenses experienced in receiving medical services from a \"nonparticipating\" doctor (if the plan was a Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plan)\n\u25a0 Diagnostic home and office visits\n\u25a0 Ambulance service\n\u25a0 Durable medical and surgical equipment\n\u25a0 Blood transfusions\n\u25a0 Oxygen and its administration\n\u25a0 Prescription drugs not used in a hospital or outpatient facility\n\u25a0 Prosthetics and orthotics\n\u25a0 Skilled nursing facility care in excess of the basic benefit allowance\n\u25a0 Outpatient mental and nervous care\n\u25a0 Outpatient drug and alcohol/substance-abuse care\n          These expenses were generally reimbursed after the participant paid an annual deductible in a major medical plan. He or she was then responsible for the relevant coinsurance amount. A plan may have required a deductible of $500 worth of eligible major medical type expenses per person before the plan began to reimburse. A typical level of coinsurance required by the participant was 20 percent. Therefore, under this type of arrangement, the plan would begin to reimburse at 80 percent after the deductible was satisfied. Typically, the plan reimbursed at 100 percent after an individual incurred a certain amount of coinsurance. For instance, the plan may have reimbursed at 80 percent for the first $10,000 of expenses and then picked up at 100 percent above the $10,000 threshold after the individual had paid $2,000 worth of co-payments out of pocket. The rationale for eliminating the coinsurance after a certain level and establishing an out-of-pocket maximum payment by the subscriber was the recognition that even requiring a coinsurance amount of 20 percent can cause extreme financial hardship in the event of a catastrophic illness.\n          Major medical plans had some lifetime maximum cap on eligible benefit charges after which the plan ceased reimbursing the participant. For instance, an individual might have been subject to a $1 million lifetime plan maximum, meaning that the plan would no longer cover expenses if the individual incurred eligible major medical expenses in excess of this limit.\n          The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, sought to protect individuals from losing their health coverage in the event of adverse illness. One method to achieve this goal was to prohibit the imposition of lifetime dollar limits on health benefits. PPACA prohibited lifetime dollar limits on \"essential health benefits\" for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010. Plans were permitted to impose \"restricted\" annual dollar limits on essential health benefits until the 2014 plan year. However, beginning in 2014, even restricted annual dollar limits were prohibited.\n          The rules regarding lifetime and annual dollar limits only applied to \"essential health benefits.\" Plans could continue to impose lifetime dollar limits on benefits that were not considered to be \"essential.\" Under PPACA, at a minimum, \"essential benefits\" included\n\u25a0 Ambulatory patient services\n\u25a0 Emergency services\n\u25a0 Hospitalization\n\u25a0 Maternity and newborn care\n\u25a0 Mental health and substance-use disorders, including behavioral health treatment\n\u25a0 Prescription drugs\n\u25a0 Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices\n\u25a0 Laboratory services\n\u25a0 Preventative and wellness services and chronic disease management\n\u25a0 Pediatric services, including oral and vision care\n          It should be noted that \"essential health benefits\" are the types of benefits that must be provided through the Health Exchanges when they are established in 2014; they are not at present mandates for employer plans. Employer plans (as of 2011) needed only to be concerned about these benefits in connection with lifetime and annual dollar limits. Until the Department of Labor (DOL) determined benefits typically covered by employers via survey, a \"good faith effort\" to comply with the term \"essential benefits\" was permissible.\n\nComprehensive Plans: The Early Days\n          It is not hard to imagine the change in design of medical plans that occurred as the economics of medical care, utilization patterns, and technological enhancements increased the cost of the prepayment and traditional indemnity plans. Comprehensive medical plans were an adaptation of the major medical approach. Essentially, the structural approach of up-front deductibles and coinsurance was applied not only to supplemental medical services but also to hospitalization and basic medical services. What was a supplemental insurance approach to items not covered in the base medical plan became the mode of providing all medical insurance. The cost of medical insurance was decreased for two primary reasons. First, plan participants were cost sharing each time medical expenses were incurred through the up-front deductible and coinsurance. Second, because plan participants were required to pay a portion of medical costs when incurring services, they were given a financial incentive to be better health care consumers, unlike with first-dollar coverage, where there was no incentive to curb unnecessary utilization or choose less costly care. Comprehensive plans tended to be easier to communicate to plan participants, because there was no need to explain different component parts of a plan, which benefits were in each component, and which benefits were subject to deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nCost Control Features of Comprehensive Plans\n          Because many comprehensive plans were designed with cost savings as a primary objective, they had other cost-controlling features. Some of these features were applied later to other plan designs when organizations wanted to restrain the cost escalation in these programs. Some of the cost-controlling features included requiring second surgical opinions, full coverage for certain diagnostic tests, preadmission certification requirements for hospitalizations, utilization reviews by the insurer or a third-party administrator, and enhanced reimbursements if procedures were performed at an outpatient facility.\n           These plan features were intended to control costs and reduce unnecessary care. A plan sometimes exempted certain items such as second surgical opinions and diagnostic testing from the deductible and coinsurance provisions, and either required or encouraged their use. The belief was that second surgical opinions could decrease unnecessary surgical procedures, and diagnostic tests could result in early detection of certain medical conditions that were more cost effectively treatable if identified early. Preadmission certification required either plan participants or the admitting hospital to check with a specialist at the insurer or the plan sponsor before admitting an individual for treatment. The intent was to allow insur\u00ad ers to review provider decisions as to the cost-effectiveness and necessity of the treatment before hospitalization and to intervene if necessary. Utilization review involved an examination of medical patterns to deter\u00ad mine whether plan participants or certain health care providers seemed to be outside average utilization ranges or expected practice patterns. Utilization review was concurrent, prospective, or retrospective. Enhanced reimbursements or waiving of deductibles and co-payments would occur if certain procedures were performed on an outpatient basis. The belief here was that a financial incentive would encourage plan participants to opt for a less costly outpatient treatment rather than a more costly treatment involving hospital inpatient care.\n\nComprehensive Plan Benefits: Further Development\n          The cost-control features just described are mainstream in comprehensive plans if offered today. These plans would subject virtually all expenses to a deductible and then reimburse an amount that excludes the coinsurance the participant must pay. However, certain benefits might be paid at 100 percent if they are viewed as contributing to a more economical means of accessing medical services, primarily as an alternative to inpatient hospital care. Also, as with major medical programs, most comprehensive plans had a maximum out-of-pocket payment, after which the plan would reimburse 100 percent of the UCR fee. Special daily limitations and annual maximum and lifetime caps also applied. (As was indicated and summa\u00ad rized above, PPACA severely limited annual and lifetime caps on \"essential benefits.\") A typical plan with a 20 percent coinsurance amount might have had benefits configured in the following way:\n\nBenefits Paid at 80 Percent of the Insurer's Established UCR Fee (Subject to Deductible)\n\u25a0 Inpatient days room and board (preadmission certification required for admission)\n\u25a0 Maternity and newborn care\n\u25a0 Administration of radiation and chemotherapy\n\u25a0 Inpatient surgical services\n\u25a0 Physician office visits\n\u25a0 Chiropractic care\n\u25a0 Anesthesia\n\u25a0 Outpatient hospitalization services\n\u25a0 Emergency accident and medical emergency expenses\n\u25a0 Prescription drugs\n\u25a0 Private duty nursing\n\u25a0 Preadmission hospital testing\n\u25a0 Skilled nursing facility care\n\u25a0 Hospice care\n\u25a0 Respite care\n\u25a0 Physical and respiratory therapy\n\nBenefits Paid at 100 Percent of the Insurer's Established UCR Fee (Not Subject to Deductible)\n\u25a0 Outpatient diagnostic tests, X-rays, and laboratory examinations\n\u25a0 Outpatient surgery or procedures performed at an ambulatory care facility, doctor's office, or surgi-center\n\u25a0 Home health care\n\u25a0 Second surgical opinions for specific medical procedures (it should be noted that many plans no longer required second surgical opinions, but had a concurrent utilization review procedure that served the same purpose)\n        In obtaining medical services from a Blue Cross/Blue Shield Comprehensive Plan, it could still be beneficial to seek services from the \"participating\" doctors, because a \"nonparticipating\" provider could charge an amount in excess of the insurer's UCR fee schedule. This could result in a plan participant having to pay more than 20 percent coinsurance because the plan would reimburse based upon the UCR fee.\n        It is unlikely that an employer would have offered a comprehensive major medical plan as a stand-alone plan once health reimbursement accounts (HRAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) became available. If the comprehensive-type approach to a medical plan was desired, generally it would make more sense for the employer to offer a consumer driven health plan (CDHP) (described below), where a tax-advantaged reimbursement account would be combined with a high deductible health plan (HDHP). In essence, the enhancement of a tax-advantaged reimbursement account generally made comprehensive plans obsolete and CDHPs more state of the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

If minimum essential coverage is provided, also included are the lowest cost option and the required contribution under the employer plan; and, if the employer's minimum essential coverage is unaffordable, information regarding income, family size and changed circumstances, as described above. If an enrollee changes (or adds) employment while in a qualified health plan for which the credit or reduction is allowed, he or she must provide such information regarding the new employer.\n\t\u2022 Individuals seeking exemption from the individual responsibility requirement must provide information on income, family size, changed circumstances and employer-sponsored coverage, as described above.\n\n\tNotices to employers. The ACA requires exchanges to notify employers if they have at least one employee who was determined to be eligible for an advance premium tax credit (APTC) and/or cost sharing reductions (CSRs), based on the employee's assertion that he or she was neither enrolled in nor eligible for employer sponsored coverage that is affordable and meets minimum value standards.

HHS has issued instructions and a form for employers who have received a Marketplace notice stating they may be subject to the employer shared responsibility payment. Employers can request an appeal by submitting the form or mailing a letter that includes the information requested on the form. The instructions indicate that employers should use the form if they are appealing a notice received from either the federally-facilitated Health Insurance Marketplace or a state-based Marketplace operating in California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York or Vermont.(Reference 6 below)\n\n\tThe appeal may determine if an employee was eligible for help with the costs of coverage through the Marketplace at the same time that an employer may have offered the employee affordable health coverage that met the minimum value standard. The instructions emphasize that this appeal will not determine whether an organization has to pay the payment. Only IRS, not the Health Insurance Marketplace or the Marketplace Appeals Center (Center), can determine which employers are subject to the payment.\n \n\tThe instructions indicate that employers should complete and sign the form, and mail it with copies of any supporting documents to the following address: Health Insurance Marketplace, Dept. of Health and Human Services, 465 Industrial Blvd., London, KY 40750-0061. The form also can be faxed to a secure fax line: 1-877-369-0129. According to the instructions, the employer will receive all future correspondence about the appeal from the Center. Note that the Center is different from the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\n\tThe instructions explain that after an appeal request is received, the following will occur:\n\n\t\t1. The Center will send the employer a notice letting the employer know that the Center received the appeal request. If there's a problem with the appeal request, the Center will tell the employer how to correct the issue. HHS also will send a notice to the employee listed on the notice received from the Marketplace.\n\t\t2. The Center will review the appeal, including any additional documentation provided by the employer and/or the associated employee. The Center may request additional information.\n\t\t3. The Center will send appeal decision notices explaining the outcome of its review to the employer and to the associated employee.\n\n\tPenalties. Individuals who fail to furnish the required information are subject to civil penalties, in addition to other applicable penalties, as follows:(Reference 7 below)\n\t\t\n\t\t\u2022 up to $25,000, for providing incorrect information on an application due to \"negligence or disregard\" of the rules and regulations (to be waived if the HHS Secretary determines that there was reasonable cause and that the individual acted in good faith);\n\t\t\u2022 up to $250,000, for knowingly and willfully providing false or fraudulent information; and\n\t\t\u2022 up to $25,000, for knowingly and willfully using or disclosing information, in violation of the confidentiality provisions.\n\n\tEmployer responsibility study.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 515 - Health Benefits - Health Plan Administration - Benefit Denial Procedures\n\n   There are many reasons why a claim might be denied. For example, the services may not be covered by the benefit plan. Another common reason for denial is that the treatment is experimental. The plan maximum benefit level may have been reached. The individual may not be eligible under the plan because he or she has not worked for the employer for the required number of days. Denial can also occur when the claimant has a preexisting condition that precludes coverage until a specified exclusion period has passed.\n   If a claim is denied. When a claim is denied, the plan administrator must provide the claimant with the reasons for denial in easy-to-understand language. The plan administrator must explain the information needed to perfect the claim, cite the plan provisions on which the denial was based, and detail the procedure for appealing the claim decision (Reference 1 below).\n   Ultimately, a participant may initiate a lawsuit to decide whether the plan should pay a claim. Depending on the amount of discretion accorded the administrator in interpreting a claim, the court could decide whether the denial of benefits constituted an abuse of discretion or review the facts de novo and make a decision on coverage (see KB-1 Topic 55).\n   For a detailed discussion of the benefit claims procedure, see KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nSupreme Court decisions\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that ERISA did not preempt an Illinois law allowing for an independent external review to resolve disputes over the \"medical necessity\" of medical treatments that a patient's primary care doctor has recommended (Reference 3 below). The end result of the Court's decision is that state independent review laws will control, as long as they don't create a new cause of action or provide a remedy beyond the benefits otherwise available under a plan.\n   The Supreme Court also has held that a Texas state law, the Texas Health Care Liability Act (fHCLA), was preempted by ERISA where two HMO participants sought recovery under the THCLA for their HMOs' refusal to provide certain treatment and services recommended by their doctors. The claims were only to rectify wrongful benefits denials; they did not arise independently of ERISA or the plans' terms. Because the claims were pure eligibility decisions, ERISA, not state law, provided the exclusive remedy (Reference 4 below).\n \nInterpretation of eligible expenses\n   In the process of paying or denying a claim, the administrator should differentiate expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from those that are not allowed under the plan. While many employers adopt many of the same plan provisions and follow state or federal laws that apply to the plans, each employer does have discretion in designing the welfare benefit plan that it offers to employees. Therefore, the claim payer must be able to identify each employer's plan and the specific provisions of the plan to identify eligible expenses.\n   Just because a charge is eligible for payment does not mean that the plan will reimburse for it. Charges that are not allowed should neither be reimbursed nor applied toward satisfaction of the deductible.\n   Pointer: The plan document should specify and define noncovered expenses so that the administrator, utilization reviewers, the employer, and participants can all clearly understand types of charges that the plan will not allow.\n   Payments that were wrongfully made by an administrator may be recovered under ERISA and claims fraudulently submitted may be denied payment.\n\nFor more information...\n   Claim procedure requirements under ERISA are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n   An ERISA-required review after a benefit denial is analyzed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n   Claim procedure requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are discussed at KB-1 Topic 934.\n\nFor more information ...\n   A discussion of possible reasons for denial of a medical claim is located at KB-1 Topic 10,425 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f) and (g).\n3 Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 45 - Basics of ERISA - Benefit Claims Procedures - Claims Procedures for Welfare Benefit Plans\n    Every welfare benefit plan must establish a claims procedure to process claims for benefits made by participants and beneficiaries. The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has issued regulations that provide new standards for processing claims under group health and group disability plans.\n    In July, 2010, the IRS, EBSA, and the HHS issued interim final regulations that added a number of requirements for internal claims procedures and appeals. The new rules implement the claims appeals requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111-148). These ACA changes are effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, though the Labor Department has provided for a grace period. Claims procedures under health reform are discussed at r 934\n    A plan that denies a claim for plan benefits must give the claimant adequate written notice of the denial. The claimant must also receive a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial (Reference 1 below).\n    The rules for filing a claim must be described in the summary plan description (SPD) (see r 110). A poorly written SPD that does not clearly specify a time limit for claims may excuse an employee from meeting the deadline (Reference 2 below).\n    The Eleventh Circuit has ruled that relevant medical records do not have to be supplied to a participant until after the decision to grant or deny a disability benefits claim has been made (Reference 3 below).\n\nNecessary information\n    A notice of a claim denial must state, in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the claimant, the following information:\n1. The specific reasons for the denial of the claim;\n2. A specific reference to the pertinent plan provision on which the denial is based;\n3. A description of any additional material or information that is necessary for a claimant to perfect the claim;\n4. An explanation of why the additional material or information needed to perfect the claim is necessary; and\n5. A description of the steps necessary (i.e., the appeals procedure) if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.\n    Pointer: If a participant brings a lawsuit claiming that an administrator's decision to deny benefits was made in bad faith, the fact that an administrator can show that these procedures were adhered to could help the administrator avoid liability for punitive damages (Reference 4 below).\n\nAdministrator as fiduciary\n    When a plan administrator denies a participant's claim for benefits, the administrator is acting as a fiduciary and so must meet the rules governing the conduct of fiduciaries.\n\nDisability benefit claims\n    At the initial level, disability claims must be resolved within 45 days of receipt. A plan may extend the decision-making period for an additional 30 days for reasons beyond the control of the plan. If, after this first extension, the plan administrator determines that it will still be unable, again for reasons beyond the control of the plan, to make a decision, the plan may extend decision-making for a second 30-day period.\n    During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan. Reviews of disability claim denials must be completed within 45 days of receipt of the claimant's request for review by the plan. Plans providing disability benefits may extend the decision\u00admaking time on review for an additional 45-day period if the plan administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim (Reference 5 below).\n    Final disability claims regs EBSA has issued final regulations that would enhance existing disability benefit claims procedures under ERISA Sec.503 (Reference 6 below). Note, however, that the Labor Department delayed the applicability date of these regulations until April 1, 2018, for ERISA plans to comply with a final rule amending the claims procedure requirements applicable to disability benefits. In issuing these regulations, EBSA hopes to apply to disability benefits many of the claims procedural protections and safeguards that have been applied to group health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The purpose of the regulation would improve the current procedural protections for workers who become disabled and make claims for disability benefits from an employee benefit plan.\n    \nThe regulations make the following major changes to the internal claims procedures for disability plans:\n claims and appeals must be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making the benefit determination;\n benefit denial notices must contain a complete discussion of why the plan denied the claim and the standards applied in reaching the decision, including the basis for disagreeing with the views of health care professionals, vocational professionals, or with disability benefit determinations by the Social Security Administration (SSA);\n claimants must be given timely notice of their right to access to their entire claim file and other relevant documents and be guaranteed the right to present evidence and testimony in support of their claim during the review process;\n claimants must be given notice and a fair opportunity to respond before denials at the appeals stage are based on new or additional evidence or rationales;\n plans cannot prohibit a claimant from seeking court review of a claim denial based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the plan if the plan failed to comply with the claims procedure requirements unless the violation was the result of a minor error;\n certain rescissions of coverage are to be treated as adverse benefit determinations triggering the plan's appeals procedures; and\n required notices and disclosures issued under the claims procedure regulation must be written in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.\n\n  Conflicts of interest. The final rule requires that decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or similar matters with respect to any individual must not be made based upon the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of disability benefits. For example, a plan cannot provide bonuses based on the number of denials made by a claims adjudicator. Similarly, a plan cannot contract with a medical expert based on the expert's reputation for outcomes in contested cases, rather than base on the expert's professional qualifications.\n  Right to appoint representative. The claims procedure of an ERISA-covered plan cannot \"preclude an authorized representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.\" In addition, prior department guidance on the claims procedure regulation confirms that authorized representatives are entitled to notifications in connection with initial claim determinations and appeals. Although a plan may establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant, the procedure cannot prevent claimants from choosing for themselves who will act as their representative or preclude them from designating an authorized representative for the initial claim, an appeal of an adverse benefit determination, or both. The plan must include any procedures for designating authorized representatives in the plan's claims procedures and in the plan's summary plan description (SPD) or a \nseparate document that accompanies the SPD. SPDs must satisfy the style and format requirements for SPDs in ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2520.102-2, and include a statement that the plan's claims procedures are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document (Reference 7 below).\n\n  Disclosure requirements. Under the final disability claims regulations, benefit denial notices must contain a more complete discussion of why the plan denied a claim and the standards used in making the decision. For example, the notices must include a discussion of the basis for disagreeing with a disability determination made by the SSA if presented by the claimant in support of his or her claim. Also, benefit denial notices must include a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, the entire claim file and other relevant documents.\n Benefit denial notices also have to include the internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the plan that were used in denying a claim or a statement that none were used. Currently, instead of including these internal rules and protocols, benefit denial notices have the option of including a statement that such rules and protocols were used in denying the claim and that a copy will be provided to the claimant upon request.\n\n  Deemed exhaustion. If plans do not adhere to all disability claims processing rules, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, unless the violation was the result of a minor error and other specified conditions are met. If the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, the claim or appeal is deemed denied on review without the exercise of discretion by a fiduciary and the claimant may immediately pursue his or her claim in court. The final rule also provides that the plan must treat a claim as re-filed on appeal upon the plan's receipt of a court's decision rejecting the claimant's request for review.\n  Coverage rescissions. Rescissions of coverage, including retroactive terminations due to alleged misrepresentation of fact (e.g. errors in the application for coverage) must be treated as adverse benefit determinations, thereby triggering the plan's appeals procedures. Rescissions for non-payment of premiums are not covered by this provision.\n  Culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The disability claims final rule requires that benefit denial notices have to be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner in certain situations. The final rule essentially adopts the ACA standard for group health benefit notices. Specifically, if a disability claimant's address is in a county where 10 percent or more of the population is literate only in the same non-English language, benefit denial notices must include a prominent statement in the relevant non-English language about the availability of language services. The plan would also be required to provide a verbal customer assistance process in the non-English language and provide written notices in the non-English language upon request.\n\nTiming of group health plan claims\n   Decisions on urgent health care claims must be made within 72 hours from the time the claim is made. There is also a 72-hour limit for decisions on appeals of denials of urgent care claims. For decisions on non-urgent claims, the regulations make a distinction between pre-service claims (group health claims that involve access to medical care) and post-service claims (claims that involve purely the payment or reimbursement of costs for medical care that has already been provided). The regulations require that pre-service claims be decided within a maximum of 15 days at the initial level, and 30 days on review of an adverse benefit determination. Decisions on post-service claims are subject to a maximum time period of 30 days for the initial decision and a maximum of 60 days on review of a denied claim (Reference 8 below).\n   During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan.\n   Notice requirements. The regulations create notice requirements in certain circumstances. In situations involving pre-service claims, plans will be required to provide a notice informing claimants that they failed to properly file a claim, if such is the case. However, this requirement will only be triggered by a communication from a claimant or a health care professional representing the claimant, and the notice may be provided orally unless requested in writing.\n   The regulations require that a plan inform a claimant of any protocol that was relied upon in denying a claim, and either supply the relevant protocol with the notice of denial or inform the claimant of its availability from the plan upon request and free of charge. Also, notifications of claim denials based on medical necessity, experimental treatment, or other similar exclusions or limits must either explain the scientific judgment of the plan or include a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request (Reference 9 below).\n   Appeal of claim denials. Claimants must be afforded 180 days in which to bring an appeal of a denied claim. The review must be conducted by a fiduciary who is neither the party who made the initial adverse determination nor a subordinate of that party (Reference 10 below). A plan administrator's affirmance of the denial of disability benefits in a first-level internal appeal is not an \"adverse benefit determi\u00ad nation\" and, as such, an ERISA plan is not required to provide a claimant with at least 180 days to file a mandatory second appeal (Reference 11 below).\n   The fiduciaries who review a claim denial that is based on a medical judgment must consult with a health care professional with appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the claim. The consultant must also be independent of any health care professional consulted in making the initial adverse benefit determination in that the reviewer must be different from, and not subordinate to, the individual involved in the initial determination. The reviewer need not be unaffiliated with the health plan in question.\n\nAppeals process under ACA\n   Under health reform legislation, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims (see KB-1 Topic 934).\n \nFor more information ...\n   Rules governing fiduciary responsibility are discussed beginning at r 25.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 50 - Basics of ERISA - Benefit Claims Procedures - Reviewing a Benefit Denial\n\n\tWhen benefit claims are denied, a plan participant can challenge the decision under the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA The appeal can be heard either by an arbitrator or in the courts.\n\nCaution: Generally, administrative remedies must be exhausted (that is, the participant or beneficiary must first follow all of the claims procedures in the plan) before a court's consideration of a claim. \n\t However, some courts have indicated that administrative remedies need not be exhausted prior to pursuing a court action if a participant can show that use of administrative remedies would be futile. \n\t However, an employer need not notify the employee, in a claim denial, that internal claim review procedures must be exhausted before a civil enforcement suit is filed. (Reference 1 below)\n\nStandards of review\n\tIn reviewing a benefit denial under ERISA's civil enforcement standards, a court can consider the case anew from the beginning on its merits in what is called de novo review.\n\tHowever, where a plan gives the administrator or fiduciary the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan, a court needs only to determine whether the actions of the plan administrator were arbitrary and capricious.(Reference 2 below)\n\t\nSupreme Court rejection of deference exceptions. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that where a company's plan provisions gave the plan administrator the power to construe disputed terms, a federal district court should have deferred to the administrator's reasonable interpretation of disputed provisions.(Reference 3 below)\n\nArbitrary and capricious standard\nIn determining whether a fiduciary's actions were arbitrary and capricious, courts generally have considered whether\n\t1. the fiduciary acted rationally or reasonably;\n\t2. there was fraud or bad faith;\n\t3. there was a consistent application of the terms of the plan or ERISA; or\n\t4. the fiduciary's actions were based on substantial evidence.\n\nPointer: The provision of adequate notice prior to a fiduciary's exercise of discretionary authority might be considered relevant to a determination of arbitrariness.\nAn employee benefit plan that gave different reasons for denying benefits to a plan beneficiary at each stage of review failed to comply with requirements under ERISA.(Reference 4 below) The court found that the plan's denial had been arbitrary and capricious.\n\nReview of conflict-of-interest cases\n\tA plan administrator that both evaluates and pays benefits claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionai:y benefit determinations, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.(Refernce 5 below)\n\tThe conflict does not change the standard of review of a benefits denial from deferential to de novo, but the conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. \n\tA conflict of interest should prove more important where there is a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, such as where an insurance company administrator has a histoi:y of biased claims administration. \n\tThe conflict would prove less important, the court explained, where an administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\n\nFor more information ...\nThe standards of judicial review following a denial of benefits are discussed in greater detail at KB-1 Topic 130,090 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\nCivil enforcement under ERISA is discussed at KB-1 Topic 55.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1 Kinkead v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 370 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Health Insurance Benefits\n    The type of protection afforded employees depends on the kinds of benefits being provided and the way in which they are paid. Payment may be through insurance premiums, via a trust or fund, or directly from the employer. Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage or incur costs such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nHealth insurance\n    Health insurance may be an umbrella for medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits, although each of these may also be separate plans or part of a cafeteria plan (see KB-1 Topic 2000). In addition, specific benefits such as mental health, substance abuse management, and prescription drugs, although often part of the health plan, are receiving separate attention due to escalating costs and societal concerns.\n    Medical. Medical coverage protects employees and their families from the total cost burden of the treatment of disease, illness, pregnancy and birth, or accidents and the prevention of disease. Medical. plans cover care delivered in hospitals, physicians' offices, and outpatient settings. Increasingly, the cost of the coverage is shared between employers and employees through employee contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n    Dental. Dental plans cover treatment and preventive care of the teeth, gums, and mouth. Coverage normally is provided through insured plans, self-insured plans, and health maintenance organizations. Plan design varies for certain types of care, such as orthodontia, preventive mali:i.tenance, cosmetic and voluntary procedures, and for coinsurance percentages (see KB-1 Topic 385).\n    Vision. A vision plan is not a common benefit, although certain injuries to eyes may be covered under most medical plans. A vision benefit plan could underwrite the cost of eye examinations, eyeglasses or contact lenses, and eye surgery. Some provide discounted prices for eyeglasses and examinations (see KB-1 Topic 390).\n    Hearing. Separate hearing benefit plans occur in a few union plans, but are a rarity. The plans provide payment for the diagnosis, fitting, and purchase of hearing aids and the treatment of hearing loss.\n    Mental health. Mental health coverage is usually part of the medical plan, although some companies have provided employee assistance programs (EAPs), preferred provider networks (PPOs), and managed care counselling to facilitate treatment outside the traditional medical plan. The benefit plan generally covers a certain number of days per year in an inpatient setting or pays a portion of the cost of outpatient treatment for a specified number of visits to a licensed provider.\n    Pointer: Annual and lifetime dollar limits can be no more restrictive than the limits for medical/surgical coverage. In the past, the Mental Health Parity Act contained a sunset provision. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the mental health parity provisions will no longer expire. In addition, the provisions have been enhanced and substance abuse coverage has been added. For more information, see r 400.\n    Substance abuse management. \u00b7treatment for substance abuse has also become a growth industry and a problem for employers. Inpatient detoxification is normally part of the medical plan or health maintenance organization coverage (see KB-1 Topic 405). However, ongoing outpatient therapy often is arranged on an exception basis by the insurer and the employer, using a case manager as an intermediary (see r 960).\n    Prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is part of most medical plans. Independent drug plans, however, have become a popular alternative for larger companies as an adjunct to the medical plan. These offer generic drug substitution at prices lower than available over the counter and are often done on a mail-order basis. Prescription drug plans can produce cost savings for beneficiaries undergoing long-term therapies to treat illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure (see r 380).\n \nPayment mechanisms\n    Benefits may be insured, partially insured, or self-insured. Further, they are funded, self-funded, or unfunded. This terminology refers to the manner in which an employer shares the risk of the cost of claims and pays for the coverage (see also KB-1 Topic 500).\n\nInsured benefits\n    Medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits may be fully insured through insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, health mainte\u00ad nance organizations, preferred provider networks, associations, or welfare funds.\n    Fully insured benefits. When benefits are fully insured, the insurer estimates the total claim liability for all employees and beneficiaries and adds the projected cost for expenses such as administration, marketing, accounting reserves and trend to develop a cost for the plan year. This estimate represents the total cost for the employer for the plan year. The insurer absorbs any charges above the amount and profit when the total costs are below the estimate. The employer remits a premium on a monthly basis to the insurer.\n    Partially insured arrangement. Under a partially insured arrangement, a portion of estimated claims is insured, usually under stop loss policies, while the rest of the claims are paid on a self-insured basis.\n    Self-insured benefits. An employer that self-insures reimburses the claim payer for claims as they come due or on a delayed basis under agreement with the claim payer. In a self-insured arrangement, the employer assumes the responsibility for the entire cost of paying and processing the claims. A company contracting with an outside provider, such as a managed care vendor or mail-order drug supplier, may negotiate a contract involving minimal risk on either party and pay a charge based on the number of participants per month or on a formula representing the actual costs.\n\nFunding\n    Regardless of whether benefits are provided through insurance or self-insurance, the employer may fully or partially fund the benefits. A fully funded plan involves setting aside anticipated claim costs on a regular basis, sometimes using a trust. An unfunded plan would deduct claim costs from the general assets of the employer on an as-needed basis, with no advance reserving or budgeting. Sometimes funding arrangements are negotiated that involve a delay in remitting payment, subject to an interest charge.\n    A smaller employer is more likely to fully insure and fully fund a welfare benefit program, while larger companies tend to self-insure and self-fund, often with some form of stop-loss insurance as protection against catastrophic claims (see KB-1 Topic 470).\n \nEmployee cost participation\n    Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of insurance. In addition, employees often share in the cost of benefits through deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments (see KB-1 Topic 375).\n\nFor more information ...\n    Employer funding of health plans is discussed at KB-1 Topic 455.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -  Group Insurance Pricing - Experience Rating\n\n\tWith experience rating, an insurance company considers a group's claims experience, either at the issue date or at the end of a policy period, when determining the premium rate for that group. When applied prospectively (that is, to future periods), experience rating is used to determine (1) adjustments in renewal premiums (either upward or downward) for those groups whose claims experience has deviated from what was expected and (2) initial premiums for large groups that change insurance carriers.\n\nDividend\n\nRetrospective Rate Credit\n\n\tIn addition to determining the premium rate for the next policy period (usually 12 months), experience rating is also used to compute the refund payable to the policyowner (usually the employer) for those groups that had better claims experience than anticipated. Mutual insurance companies refer to this refund as a dividend, and stock insurance companies call it a retrospective rate credit or premium refund. Under some experience-rating arrangements, the premium at the end of a policy period may also be retroactively adjusted upward if a group's claims experience has been worse than anticipated, and an additional premium is charged. These arrangements are not very common.\n\nRationale for Experience Rating\n\n\tOne argument in favor of experience rating is that it achieves the ultimate degree of premium equity among policyowners. Even though manual rating also results in equity because it considers the obvious factors that affect claims, it is impossible to measure and make adjustments in the manual rates for such factors as lifestyle, working conditions, and morale, all of which contribute to the level of claims experience. Experience rating is also the most cost-effective way to reflect the general health of a group in the premium that is charged.\n\n\tProbably the major reason for using experience rating is the competition that exists in the group insurance marketplace. If an insurance company were to use identical rates for all groups regardless of their experience, the employers with good experience would soon seek out insurance companies that offered lower rates, or they would turn to self-funding as a way to reduce costs. The insurance company that did not consider claims experience would therefore be left with only the poor risks. This is exactly the situation that led most of the Blues to abandon community rating for group insurance cases above a certain size. Experience rating allows an insurance company to acquire and retain the better cases (from a claims-experience standpoint) and to determine an appropriate premium for the groups that have worse-than-average claims experience.\n\nDividend Calculation\n\n\tAt first glance, the process of using experience rating to determine dividends appears complex. However, the actual mechanics are relatively simple, and much of the confusion stems from the fact that the process is lengthy. In addition, both the format and the terminology vary somewhat among insurance companies. This discussion focuses on the illustration in the table \"Illustrative Dividend Calculation\" and explains the steps used to calculate the dividend for a group medical expense insurance case of about 400 lives. Although this illustration can be considered a typical example of a dividend calculation, variations could have been (and often are) used.\n\nTable 15-11 Illustrative Dividend Calculation\n\n1.

In most instances, this is the sum of 12 monthly premiums. The premiums paid may have been based on manual rates or on the group's past experience.\n\nStop-Loss Limit\n\n\tStep 2 specifies the stop-loss limit-the maximum namount of any claim that is charged to the group in the experience-rating calculation. Its purpose is to minimize the effect of any chance fluctuations that might occur from year to year because of catastrophic losses within the group. These chance fluctuations tend to become relatively smaller as the size of a group increases, and insurers may not use a stop-loss limit for very large groups.\n\n\tThe stop-loss limit in medical expense insurance is usually expressed as a dollar amount per claim, and the actual figure is subject to negotiation between the policyowner and the insurance company. In this illustration, $250,000 is used. Therefore, if a claim of $400,000 is incurred because of a premature birth, only the first $250,000 of the claim will be used in the experience-rating calculation.\n\n\tObviously, a charge must be made somewhere for incorporating a stop-loss provision into an experience-rating contract, because the insurance company is obligated to pay any excess amount over the stop-loss limit. The charge in this illustration is shown in step 7. In effect, this charge for stop-loss coverage can be viewed as a manual-rate charge for losses in excess of some limit, with only those losses below the limit subject to experience rating.\n\nIncurred Claims\n\nExperience Period \n\nIncurred Claims\n\n\tStep 3 involves the determination of incurred claims, which are those claims attributable to the recently ended period of coverage that was subject to experience rating (that is, the experience period). It may seem as if the incurred claims are those claims that were paid during the experience period. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. Some of the claims that were paid during the experience period may actually be attributable to previous periods and must be subtracted from the incurred claims. In addition, other claims that are attributable to the experience period may not have been reported or may be in the course of settlement. However, insurance companies need to estimate their value.\nTherefore, an appropriate determination of incurred claims is as follows:\n\nincurred claims\t\t\tclaims paid during the experience period\n\t\t\t\tclaims paid during the experience period but \n\t\t\t\tincurred during previous periods\n\t\t\t+\testimate of claims incurred during the experience \n\t\t\t\tperiod but to be paid in future periods\n\nIn actual practice, incurred claims are usually expressed as follows:\n\nincurred claims \t\tpaid claims\n\t\t\t+\tending claim reserve \n\t\t\t\tbeginning claim reserve \n\t\t\t\tor\nincurred claims\t\t\tpaid claims\n\t\t\t+\tchange in claim reserve\n\nClaim Reserve\n\n\tThis claim reserve, which is often referred to as the open-and-unreported claim reserve, represents an estimate by the insurance company for (1) claims that have been approved but not yet paid, (2) claims that are in the course of settlement, and (3) claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (often referred to as IBNR). In addition, when disability income coverage or medical expense coverage is experience rated, an additional amount is added to this estimate for any claims that have been incurred, reported, and approved but are not yet payable. Essentially, these claims arise from disabilities or current medical claims that will continue beyond the experience period.\n\n\tBased on past experience, most insurance companies can closely estimate the percentage of claims that they will pay after the close of the experience period for a given type of coverage. Although this estimate reflects companywide experience and may not reflect the experience of a particular policyowner, insurers usually apply it to each group insurance case rather than determine the claim reserve on a case-by-case basis. In general, the claim reserve is based either on a percentage of the annual premium (before experience rating) or on a percentage of claims paid. The first approach is most common for small groups, and the latter approach tends to be used for large groups. This percentage varies considerably by type of coverage, with the claim reserve for group term life insurance usually ranging between 10 to 15 percent of the annual premium (and up to 25 percent if a waiver of premium for disability is included), and the claim reserve for medical expense coverage often ranging from 20 to 65 percent, depending on what benefits are involved.\n\nExpected Claims\n\n\tThe amount of expected claims in step 4 represents the portion of the premiums paid that the insurance company has anticipated would be necessary to pay claims during the experience period. This amount may have been derived either from average experience as in manual rating or from the past experience of the particular group.\n\nCredibility\n\n\tThe credibility factor (step 5), which can vary from zero to one, is a statistical measure of the reliability of the group's past experience. In other words, it is a measure of the probability that the group's actual experience is a true reflection of the group and is not the result of chance occurrences. The credibility factor varies by the size of the group and the type of coverage. In general, the larger the group is, the greater the reliability of estimates is (because of the law of large numbers). In addition, actual experience tends to deviate less from the estimates of expected claims (on a relative basis) as the frequency of claims rises. Therefore, a greater degree of credibility can be attributed to a group's medical expense claims than to its life insurance claims.\n\n\tIn actual practice, insurers usually base credibility factors on the size of a group as determined by the number of persons (lives) who are insured. However, some insurance companies base their credibility factors on the annual premium of a group. The factors vary somewhat among insurance companies, but the excerpt in the table below from the rate manual of one insurance company that is used for this illustration is a typical example of the first approach.\n\n\tInsurers may adjust these factors to reflect any characteristics of either the group or the insurance contract that deviate from the norm. For example, an older group of employees might be assigned a higher credibility factor than a younger group whose claims are more likely to be due to random fluctuations. In addition, the level of any stop-loss limit may have an effect. As the stop-loss charge is increased (meaning the stop-loss limit is lowered), the credibility that can be assigned to the remaining claims below the stop-loss limit also increases.\n\nTable 15-12 Credibility Factors\n\n\nSize of Group (Lives)\t\t\t\t\t\tLong-Term Disability Income Insurance and Life Insurance\t\t\t\tMedical Expense Insurance and Short-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\t100\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.2\n\t200\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.5\n\t400\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.8\n\t600\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.0\n\t800\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0.9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.0\n\t1,000 or more\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.0\n\n\tSimilarly, the size of the credibility factor may be influenced by the amount of the risk charge levied on the group for establishing a contingency reserve. If an insurance company has an adequate contingency reserve for a group insurance case, it is more likely to allow the use of a higher credibility factor than can be statistically justified. This practice results in reduced claims charges for years when the employer has good experience and increased claims charges for years when it has bad experience. Although employers with a history of better-than-average claims experience desire it, a higher-than-justified credibility factor leads to a larger-than-usual deficit for a group with bad experience. It also increases the probability that the employer will terminate the contract before the deficit is eliminated. A larger contingency reserve can balance the financial consequences of this possibility.\n\nClaims Charge\n\n\tOnce the credibility factor is determined, the process of calculating the claims charge, or what claims will be charged against the group in the experience period, is relatively simple and can be expressed by the following formula:\n\nclaims charge\t\t\t(z) (incurred claims subject to experience rating)\n\t\t\t+\t(1 - z) (expected claims)\n \n\twhere z is the credibility factor\n\n\tIn effect, the claims charge is a weighted average of (1) the incurred claims that are subject to experience rating and (2) the expected claims, with the incurred claims being assigned a weight equal to the credibility factor and the expected claims being assigned a weight equal to one minus the credibility factor. In step 6 of table \"Illustrative Dividend Calculation,\" the claims charge is calculated as follows:\n\nclaims charge\t\t0.8 ($1,620,000) + (1- 0.8) ($1,700,000)\n\t\t\t0.8 ($1,620,000) + 0.2 ($1,700,000)\n\t\t\t$1,296,000 + $340,000\n\t\t\t$1,636,000\n\n\tIf a credibility factor of 1.0 is used, the claims charge is equal to the incurred claims that are subject to experience rating, and the expected claims are not taken into consideration.\n\nRetention\n\n\tThe retention (step 7) in a group insurance contract is usually defined as the excess of premiums paid over claims payments and dividends. It consists of charges for (1) the stop-loss coverage, (2) expenses (commissions, premium taxes, and administrative expenses), (3) a risk charge, and (4) a contribution to the insurance company's surplus. In this particular illustration, the sum of these charges is reduced by the interest that is credited to certain reserves-the claim reserve and any contingency reserves-that the insurance company holds to pay future claims attributable to this contract. However, some insurance companies do not subtract this interest when determining retention; rather, they treat it as an additional premium paid.\n\n\tFor large groups, insurers calculate each item in the retention separately, based on the group's actual experience. For small groups, the insurance company usually applies a formula based on insurance company averages. This formula varies according to the size of a group and the type of coverage involved; most often it is either a percentage of the claims charge or a flat charge plus a percentage of the claims charge.\n\nDividend Earned\n\n\tThe dividend earned (step 8) is computed by adding the retention to the claims charge and then subtracting this sum from the premiums paid. This is the dividend amount attributable to the group insurance case for the current experience period.\n\nPrevious Deficits\n\n\tUnder most experience-rated group insurance plans, any deficits from past periods must be made up before any future dividends are paid. Whenever the sum of the claims charge and the retention charge for any experience period exceeds the premiums paid and results in a negative dividend earned, there is a deficit. In step 9 of the table \"Illustrative Dividend Calculation,\" a $42,000 deficit from previous periods exists. Interestingly, the insurance company has no opportunity to recover this deficit if the insurance contract is not renewed. However, the fact that there is always a chance of nonrenewal is one of the reasons why insurers levy a risk charge.\n\nClaims Fluctuation Reserve\n\n\tAs additional protection against the nonrenewal of insurance contracts that have a deficit, some insurance companies require that part of any dividend earned be placed in a claims fluctuation reserve when experience is favorable. Monies are drawn from the reserve to indemnify the insurance company for the years in which there is a deficit. Because this reserve lessens the possibility that the insurance company will lose money on a group insurance case, it is usually accompanied by a lower risk charge.\n\nDividend Payable\n\n\tThe final step in the dividend-calculation process (step 10) is to establish whether there is a dividend payable. This is determined by subtracting any deficit that has been carried forward (or placed in a claims fluctuation reserve) from the dividend earned for the experience period. If this figure is positive, it is the amount of the dividend; if the figure is negative, it is the amount of the cumulative deficit that is to be carried forward.\n\n\tIn this illustration, only one type of coverage is experience rated. However, when an employer has more than one type of coverage that is experience rated with the same insurance company, a single dividend is usually determined for the combined package. This typically involves the determination of a separate claims charge for each coverage and a single retention charge for the entire package. Because \"losses\" for one type of coverage are often offset by \"gains\" for other types of coverage, the relative fluctuation in the overall experience tends to be less than the fluctuations in the experience of some or all of the individual coverages. Therefore, the overall premium can often be reduced (or the dividend increased) because the insurance company will levy a lower risk charge and/or require a lower contingency reserve.\n\nVariations for Other Types of Coverage\n\n\tIn some types of group insurance, particularly group term life insurance, there is considerable disparity in the amounts of coverage, and top executives often have much greater coverage than do the lowest-paid employees. Claims that arise from the deaths of employees who have large amounts of coverage can have a significant effect on a group's experience for the years in which they occur. Consequently, insurers use several methods to exclude these claims (or at least a portion of them) from the process of determining the claims charge in experience rating. One of these methods is the stop-loss limit that was previously mentioned. However, its primary purpose is to limit the claims charge because of a higher-than-anticipated frequency of claims, rather than because of a few high-severity claims. Some of the other methods used to handle these large claims are:\n\n\texcess-amounts pooling. This approach limits the amount of insurance that is subject to experience rating on any one person. Amounts over the limit are not experience rated but are subject to manual rates based on the ages of the individuals involved. This results in a \"pooling\" or an \"insurance\" charge that is added to either the claims charge or the retention charge, depending on the insurance company's practice. These excess amounts may also be subject to evidence of insurability.\n\n\ta lower credibility factor. Under this method, the credibility factor normally used for a certain-size group is reduced if there is a significant difference between the smallest and largest amounts of coverage. This results in more weight being placed on the group's expected claims than on their incurred claims.\n\n\tan extra contingency reserve. Under this approach, the excess of claims above a certain limit is ignored in the experience-rating process for dividend purposes but is charged against a contingency reserve that has been established (with an appropriate annual charge) for this reason.\n\n\tTwo other factors enter into the incurred claims amount for group term life insurance: disability claims and conversion charges. In addition to death claims, there may be disability claims if a group insurance contract contains a waiver-of-premium provision or another type of disability provision. Once a waiver-of-premium claim has been approved, a charge is made for future death claims, because no future premiums will be received for the disabled employee. This charge is based on the probability that the disabled employee will die prior to recovery or termination of coverage (for example, at age 65).\n\n\tOn average, the charge is about $750 for each $1,000 of coverage. If the insurance contract continues, an additional $250 per $1,000 is charged if a death claim is paid. If the employee recovers or coverage terminates prior to death, the $750 charge is credited back to the policy owner.\n\n\tA conversion charge is levied against the group insurance department of an insurance company to reflect the increased mortality on converted coverage. In the experience-rating procedure, this charge (commonly $50 to $75 per\n$1,000 of coverage converted) is transferred to the group policy owner.\n\nRenewal Rating\n\n\tInsurers often use experience rating to develop future premiums for group insurance cases based on the past experience of the group. For the most part, the procedure is similar to that for determining dividends, and in fact the two procedures are usually done at the same time. However, there are some differences. In most cases, the experience-rating period is 3 to 5 years instead of a single year, and thus cumulative premiums and charges for this period is used. In addition, a more conservative (that is, lower) credibility factor is normally applied. For example, an insurance company that uses a credibility factor of 0.8 for dividend purposes for a particular case might use a factor of 0.6 for renewal-rating purposes. Furthermore, because a premium is being developed for the future, it is also necessary to adjust past claims and the retention, not only to reflect current cost levels but also to include expected trends for the next year. Adjustments must also be made to account for any changes in the coverage. Once a renewal premium expected to be sufficient to cover claims and retention is calculated, an additional amount is added for future dividends. This amount effectively becomes a safety margin for the insurance company should both claims and retention be higher than anticipated; otherwise, it is returned as an experience dividend to the policy owner.\n\n\tInsurers may also use experience rating to develop the initial premiums for any transferred business, requiring that the insurance company obtain past data from the policyowner regarding its experience with the previous carrier. A policyowner may be reluctant to provide this information because poor experience (and the resulting rate increase) is often the reason for changing insurance companies. However, the existence of the poor claims experience is exactly the information the insurance company needs. In fact, some insurance companies actually refuse to write transferred coverage, particularly for large groups, unless the policyowner provides verifiable prior claims experience.\n\n\tIf possible, insurers use the past data to determine what the premiums and charges would have been if the new carrier had written the new contract in previous years. If this can be accomplished, the procedure is a simplified application of the principles previously described. If it cannot be accomplished, manual rating may be used for small groups, but judgment may play a large role in determining the premiums for large groups."

They come in two types: comprehensive and supplementary plans. The difference between the two is that comprehensive plans coinsure all covered medical expenses once the deductible is met, while supplementary plans coinsure all covered medical expenses (once the deductible is met) that are over and above those expenses covered by another plan.\n\nBoth types have high deductibles, co-insurance requirements, and a ceiling on the amount of benefits available during the plan year. However, both types of major medical insurance offer advantages over basic coverage health care plans:\n\u2022 Rather than covering only certain specified medical expenses, major medical plans cover almost all personal medical expenses whether the expense was incurred inside or outside of a hospital.\n\u2022 Major medical plans reimburse virtually all patients according to the same formula, regardless of the specialty of the physician, the location of the treatment, the drugs used, or the diagnostic techniques employed.\n\u2022 The maximum amount of benefits payable is considerably higher under a major medical plan than under a basic medical plan, particularly for physician and surgeon fees.\n\u2022 Having employees pay a deductible and co-insurance tends to keep them from making unnecessary visits to the doctor, which helps keep insurance costs down.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Developing a Health Care Strategy\n\nDEVELOPING A HEALTH CARE STRATEGY\n\n\tDeveloping a health care strategy for providing employee health and medical care benefits can be viewed as a program for managing risk exposures on a variety of levels. In its most elementary form, managing this risk involves a three-pronged strategy. First, the organization sponsoring the plan must decide what mode of health care delivery system will be used. Second, the organization must decide on the benefits that will be provided through the selected system. Third, the plan sponsor must decide what contractual, financial, or payment arrangement will be negotiated with insurers or providers of medical care. Negotiation of the financial arrangement also includes what level of risk is assumed by the plan sponsor and whether certain types or levels of risk will be shifted to a third party such as an insurer or the providers of the medical care itself. Increasingly, plan sponsors shift some of this risk to ensure that medical providers have a stake in providing cost-effective and quality care. All three of these macro decisions involve many other tiers of decisions at the micro level, which can have a profound impact on the levels of risk assumed and the financial costs assumed by the plan sponsor. With the advent of health care reform, additional risks have been entered into the system, since plan sponsors may be subject to providing subsidies or vouchers (see subsequent discussion in this chapter) to some of their employees and/or will be subject to certain excise taxes.\n\nDesigning the Plan and Delivery System\n\n\tThe plan sponsor is not only selecting one of the delivery systems discussed previously, but also has latitude to select various plan designs offered by alternate delivery systems or to include plan-specific provisions or procedures particular to the employer group. Unless federal or state law requires certain benefits, an employer quite often has flexibility to design its own schedule of benefits, assuming it is of sufficient size to gain this degree of customization by an insurer or managed care company. At times, even state insurance law is not an immovable constraint, because certain administrative service financing arrangements exempt plans from state insurance mandates. Limitations on specific coverages, uses of deductibles or copayments, and the systems for case management and precertification can profoundly impact both risk exposure and cost. The delivery system and plan design, its oversight, and financial incentives also can have behavioral impacts on plan participants influencing the utilization of health care services.\n\n\tWith the passage of major health care reform legislation in 2010, a new era began in structuring health benefit programs. Additional regulation at the federal level immediately impacted plan design decisions. For example, this is evident in the previously described distinction between grandfathered and non grandfathered plans. PPACA also distinguished between large and small employer plans. The Act included a tax credit for small employers that purchased health insurance for their employees when the employer\n\n\t\u25a0 Has fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees\n\t\u25a0 Pays average annual wages under $50,000\n\t\u25a0 Contributes a uniform percentage of at least 50 percent of the total premium cost\n\n\tThe full credit is available to employers with ten or fewer full-time equivalent employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000, and begins phasing out over those amounts. (Beginning in 2014, the credit is available only for qualified health plan coverage purchased through a health exchange, and employers may only receive the credit for a maximum of two consecutive years.)\n\nVarious insurance market reforms mandated by PPACA placed constraints on plan sponsor design decisions. For instance, six months after enactment, group health plans and health insurers were not allowed to\n\n\t\u25a0 Impose lifetime or annual limits on essential benefits (subject to certain exceptions).\n\t\u25a0 Rescind coverage unless there was fraud or misrepresentation by the enrollee.\n\t\u25a0 Drop coverage for adult children on their parents' coverage, regardless of the adult child's student or marital status, until the adult child turns 26 years old.\n\t\u25a0 Impose preexisting condition exclusions on enrollees under age 19.\n\nSelf-Administration, Third-Party Administrators, and Unbundled Services\n\n\tThe decision to purchase an assembled delivery system from an insurer or managed care company or to directly contract with providers is generally dependent on employer size and the geographic concentrations of an organization's employees. When an employer is of sufficient size, it might want to deal directly with medical providers and eliminate the costs associated with the intermediary insurer. Even if an employer does not want to assume the burden of self-administration, it is not necessary to purchase all medical care management services through a single provider. An employer can decide to unbundle specific services that might be more effectively performed by separate entities or purchase an integrated set of services or programs through one provider. Moving specific, specialized functions to third-party vendors with special expertise in one area can sometimes address certain goals. At the very least, an employer should understand the costs of these services if they are left bundled with the insurer and review claims and other reports to evaluate the services' effectiveness and contributions to cost control.\n\n\tUnder PPACA, by 2014, certain employers' employees gain access to health insurance through health exchanges. PPACA requires each state to establish one or more health exchanges in which small employers and individuals can purchase health insurance. Initially, only small employers have access to purchase group health insurance through an exchange. However, by 2017, states may permit large employers to purchase group health coverage through their exchanges. States have the right to define \"small\" and \"large\" employers before 2016, though small employers generally will not exceed 100 employees. Lawful United States' residents (except incarcer\u00ad ated individuals) generally can access individual health coverage through an exchange in a state in which they live.\n\nUse of Multiple Plan Offerings and Single or Multiple Administrators\n\n\tMedical care delivery systems and benefit design are not an \"all-or\u00ad nothing\" decision for many large employers. Though some employers place their entire block of business with a single insurer or managed care company, many other employers have configured a variety of health plan alternatives and give employees the choice of selecting the health plan that best meets their individual needs. This can be accomplished through a simple choice of medical plan options or through a flexible benefit plan. In large part because of limited dollars available to expand benefit programs and a recognition that a diverse workforce may have varying benefit needs, flexible benefit programs proliferated in the 1980s. In a flex plan, employees are allocated a set amount generally in the form of credits or dollars from the employer, which they can \"spend\" to select the benefits and plan options of their choice or receive those credits in the form of cash if not spent on benefits. Nevertheless, many managed care companies and insurers offer employers an array of multiple plan designs. Price concessions are often offered if an employer agrees to place the entire block of business with a single administrative entity. An employer must balance the price concessions it will receive and assess the effectiveness of the administrative entity at managing health care costs against the loss of competition that occurs when multiple plan offerings through various administrators are eliminated.\n\nPricing Plan Options and Designing Employer Subsidies\n\n\tRegardless of whether multiple administrators or a single administrator are used for separate plan offerings, the plan sponsor must look at the pricing of plan options and make decisions regarding the form and amount of employer subsidy provided to employees. An employer offering a flexible benefit program may price various plan options at prevailing market rates, assign all employees an equal credit amount, and allow them to spend the credits as they prefer. Other employers provide a direct subsidy to their medical plans and only show employees the remaining employee costs they will be required to pay. Some employers subsidize family contracts to a greater extent than single coverage. The employer must also decide how to relate the subsidy to each medical plan option. Plan pricing will affect employee selection patterns. Premiums are impacted by the level of deductibles and co-payments that have been included in the front-end plan design. Accordingly, an employer can determine whether plan costs and certain benefits are being borne by those utilizing those particular benefits or are being spread over the employee group at large.\n\nMore transparency and analysis on pricing plan options emerged in the wake of PPACA's passage. The Act imposed penalties, effective 2014, on employers with an average of 50 or more employees who\n\n\t\u25a0 Offer inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage or do not offer minimum essential coverage; or\n\t\u25a0 Have at least one full-time employee who qualifies for federal premium assistance for coverage through an exchange\n\nThe penalty varies depending on whether the employer fails to offer minimum essential coverage or offers inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage. Effective 2018, employers who provide health benefits deemed to be too generous will also be assessed penalties. An employer sponsoring a so-called \"Cadillac\" group health plan is required to pay a 40 percent excise tax on the excess value of the coverage.\n\nThe Effects of Multiple Plan Offerings on Employee Selection Patterns and Pricing\n\n\tThe offering of multiple benefit offerings can create an exodus of favorable risks from existing offerings and result in price escalations for those who choose to stay with a previously offered plan. In some cases, the offering of a new plan at favorable pricing can cause such dramatic migration out of a plan that the remaining plan will experience a price spiral that causes termination of the plan. This was particularly true in the mid-1980s for many employers who offered traditional indemnity plans. The offering of either a less expensive comprehensive plan or an HMO resulted in those employees with low utilization for major services migrating to the less costly plans, seeking to reduce their expenditures on monthly health care premiums. With this loss of favorable risks, the indemnity plan retained less favorable risks with higher utilization patterns. Because there was a smaller pool of favorable risks in the plan over which to spread plan costs, the premiums charged to those who remained increased. This increase in plan costs resulted in another wave of more favorable risks choosing to leave the plan rather than bear the increased costs of the plan. Again costs increased, giving further incentive for favorable risks to migrate from the plan. Ultimately, a cost spiral like this will cause a plan to become prohibitively expensive and result in its demise.\n\n\tAs the provisions of PPACA are phased in, employers will need to be vigilant regarding the effects that alternative access to coverage through health exchanges have on their employee selection patterns and pricing. Effective 2014, employers that pay for any portion of health coverage and offer minimum essential coverage are required to supply \"free choice vouchers\" to qualified employees to purchase qualified health coverage through an exchange. A qualified employee eligible for free choice vouch\u00ad ers has the following characteristics:\n\n\t\u25a0 His or her required contribution for minimum essential coverage through the employer's plan exceed 8 percent but is less than 9.8 percent of the employee's annual household income.\n\t\u25a0 His or her household income does not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\t\u25a0 He or she does not participate in an employer-sponsored health plan.\n\n\tThe value of the free choice voucher is the most generous amount that the employer would have contributed under the firm's plan for self-only coverage or, if relevant, family coverage. Employers are required to pay this sum to an exchange. Subsequently, the exchange credits the amount towards the monthly premium for the plan selected by the employee. When the free choice voucher amount exceeds the exchange plan premium, the difference is refunded to the employee and is subject to taxation. Employers may deduct the amount paid in vouchers and are not assessed the employer mandate penalty for employees receiving vouchers.\n\nDesigning the Underwriting and Financial Arrangements\n\n\tAs indicated in the discussion of alternative financing techniques, an employer can dramatically alter the financial arrangement of its medical benefits program by determining the amount of risk it will accept. The strategic issue is to select a financial arrangement that controls costs and allows management to assume the level of risk that it believes appropriate for its employee group. The financial arrangement selected can have a behavioral impact on both the providers managing care and the insurer or administrator responsible for management of the plan. Increasingly, employers have explored arrangements that shift more risk to health care providers and that promote incentives to provide quality care. Much research, is being done on measuring quality of care and developing information systems that can be used to evaluate cost and quality of care.\n\n\tThe financial strategy for a medical benefits program will have multiple tiers. This is particularly true if multiple plan options are available and employees choose between plan offerings. Plan pricing and plan offerings can alter enrollment patterns and affect the effectiveness of a given financial arrangement or risk-management strategy.\n\n\tDetermining cost-effective medical providers and health plans is not an easy exercise. Certain plans will attract employees from certain demographic and geographic constituencies because of plan benefits or the convenience of provider locations. Health care costs are directly correlated with age, in that older individuals tend to need more care and need to access more extensive and thus more expensive care. Likewise, there can be regional differences in the cost of medical care. Sometimes, base premium costs or allocated costs per participant are not the best indicator of cost-effective medical care. Analyzing plan costs by adjusting for demographic, geographic, and other variables in the plan population is the best way to evaluate the cost efficiency.\n\nMeasuring Performance and Managing the Plan\n\n\tA final attribute of health care strategy is to create a system of monitoring and measuring the attainment of plan objectives. It is also important to have a system of controls that ensures that the plan is being effectively managed. A well-developed plan design is of little use if a third-party administrator is unable to administer the design as it was intended. A system for auditing plan results, ensuring quality outcomes, and reporting utilization is necessary. For this reason, any delegation of responsibilities for health plan management should involve negotiation on the management reporting responsibilities of the administrator and the performance standards it is expected to achieve. Assigning financial penalties or providing rewards associated with these performance standards can be very effective. For instance, with a traditional insured product, a plan sponsor can require claims payment within a certain number of days for a percent of the claims. With a managed care provider operating a staff model HMO, reporting could be required on the telephone systems for contacting PCPs. There could be performance criteria on the amount of time it takes to reach a physician by phone, and scheduling standards for the amount of time between the initial call and an available appointment.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Introduction to Medical Expense Benefits - National Health Insurance\n\n\tFew issues in recent years have gotten as much attention as the debate over national health insurance. With health care expenditures taking nearly one out of every six dollars spent in this country and with there being more than 50 million uninsured Americans, the magnitude of the problem cannot be overemphasized. There are no easy solutions to the problems of increasing costs and the lack of coverage for everyone. Health care is an emotional issue, and any reform is complex and affects almost all Americans to varying degrees.\n\n\tThe following discussion of national health insurance addresses many aspects of the issue to provide readers with a better understanding of the issues and debates that led to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.\n\nSome Basic Historical Questions\n\n\tThe issue of national health insurance is best addressed by having an understanding of its many dimensions and discussion points.\n\nDon't We Already Have National Health Insurance?\n\n\tThe answer is yes for many Americans. Unlike most other industrialized countries, however, the United States does not have a system of national health insurance that covers everyone. Although national health insurance does exist in the form of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, certain veterans' benefits, and coverage of military personnel and their families, each of these programs addresses the issue of health insurance for a specific group and each takes a different approach.\n\n\tSome people would say that a national health insurance program also covers most other Americans. Although the role of the federal government is probably not extensive enough for most persons to agree with this observation, the federal government does in fact have an influence on the design of employer-provided medical expense plans of almost all employers. This influence comes from numerous pieces of federal legislation, such as ERISA, COBRA, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and HIPAA.\n\n\tSome Americans feel that the federal government should have no role in health care reform. But approximately 50 percent of all medical care expenditures are for persons who are either employees of the federal government or covered under the national health insurance programs previously mentioned. Therefore, the government and the taxpayers who fund its activities have a direct stake in controlling the cost of medical care.\n\nWhat Is the Objective of National Health Insurance?\n\n\tIt is difficult to determine exactly what a national health insurance program should accomplish. Alternative proposals either have different objectives or place varying degrees of emphasis on a combination of objectives. There are two primary concerns with the current health care system-rapidly increasing costs and the lack of coverage for a large segment of the population. Some programs are essentially a proposed solution to only one of these concerns; other proposals address both concerns in varying degrees. It would be much easier to find a solution if there were consensus on the scope of the actual problem.\n\n\tUnfortunately, the two problems are not independent, and solving one problem may actually exacerbate the other. For example, making broad coverage available to everyone might so increase the demand for medical treatment that costs would go up because of a shortage of medical care providers. This situation occurred after the passage of Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, efforts to control costs could lead to rationing of medical care so that some types of care would be available only to the more affluent segment of the population who could afford supplemental insurance protection.\n\nDo Americans Want Reform?\n\n\tThis is a difficult question to answer. During health care debates over the last few years, numerous polls were taken. There seemed to be overwhelming agreement among the American people that the health care system is broken and needs fixing. Some proponents of national health insurance inferred from this opinion that there was support for radical reform.\n\n\tAs the debate continued and more polls about the underlying mood of the public were conducted, a different picture began to emerge. Most Americans were reasonably happy with their own medical expense coverage. They were also aware of rapidly rising costs, but those in managed care plans had been less significantly affected by them. In fact, as many employees elected managed care options, they actually saw their out-of-pocket medical expenses decrease. However, this is changing more recently as managed care plans have increased or added deductibles and increased copayments.\n\n\tAlthough the public was not in favor of changes that would affect their relationships with providers of medical care, a surprisingly large percentage of the public was aware that reform carried a financial cost, and within limits many Americans were willing to foot the bill.\n\n\tThese further surveys also indicated that the major concern of Americans was the lack of security surrounding their own medical expense coverage, particularly if they became unemployed or changed jobs. There was fear that the loss of employment would put them in the category of uninsured. Even if coverage could be continued under COBRA, its high cost would make it unaffordable. Considerable concern was also expressed over the lack of coverage when changing jobs because of preexisting-conditions provisions in the new employer's coverage. These were significant issues addressed by recent major health insurance legislation.\n\n\tOne final observation: These surveys showed that the majority of Americans do not want another program as bureaucratic as they view Medicare to be.\\\n\nIs the Goal Universal Coverage or Universal Access?\n\nUniversal Coverage\n\n\tSome national health insurance programs call for universal coverage, which means that all Americans would be covered. Unfortunately, the cost of universal coverage would be very expensive, and it is questionable whether such a program could be accomplished voluntarily. As long as some people are in a position of voluntarily electing coverage, there are those who would be unwilling to pay the price, even if it were subsidized. Therefore, universal coverage probably requires a program similar to Medicare and accompanying tax revenue to support the program. With the majority of the public wanting a nongovernmental program of health insurance, many other national health insurance proposals focus on universal access and realize that a goal of slightly less than universal coverage is all that is realistically attainable. But even this goal will require subsidies for some segments of the population.\n\nWho Should Pay the Cost?\n\n\tA majority of the uninsured have inadequate resources to pay the cost of voluntary coverage, even if it was suddenly available. As a result, there will be some need to subsidize the cost of coverage if the number of uninsured is going to be reduced substantially. Who pays? The alternatives are many, but they can largely be summed up in one word-taxes. There have been numerous suggestions about the form of these taxes, but in all cases they will fall on some or all taxpayers. These alternatives include general tax revenue, additional Social Security taxes, taxes on cigarettes because smoking is the source of many medical problems, and even taxes on certain employer-provided benefits.\n\n\tThe fact that many of the uninsured do receive medical treatment is sometimes overlooked. Even though uninsured persons may be unable to pay, treatment by hospitals and physicians is usually not denied for serious illnesses or injuries. However, when the hospital or physician writes off a large portion of these bills as uncollectible, the cost is in effect being passed on to those who do pay their bills (usually through insurance) in the form of higher charges than would otherwise be made. In theory, the cost to many individuals or employers will decrease if a larger portion of the population has the resources to pay their own expenses. This is used as the rationale for taxing employers or individuals to pay the cost of providing protection for the uninsured.\n\n\tOne factor that would mitigate the effect of tax increases would be efficiencies in the health care system that would lower costs for everyone. This is one of the goals of the Affordable Care Act as it is being implemented.\n\nWhat Benefits Should Be Available?\n\n\tOne of the major debates in designing a national health insurance program involves the scope of the benefits to include. At one extreme in the debate are those who feel the government should guarantee only a minimum level of health care. Private medical expense insurance or personal resources would be necessary to obtain broader benefits. At the other extreme are those who feel that a comprehensive level of health care should be available to all Americans. This group views complete health care protection as a basic right that belongs to everyone regardless of income.\n\n\tThe current system of health insurance falls somewhere between these two extremes, and this is probably where any ultimate solution lies. Most Americans do not have coverage for long-term care; some have limitations on such benefits as mental health and substance abuse treatments. Plans often limit coverage for prescription drugs. Such limitations exist not because employers see no value in these benefits but because realistic cost constraints dictate the benefits that they provide. Employers cannot afford a medical expense plan that does everything for everyone, and it is questionable whether Americans are willing to pay the cost of a national health insurance program that has such a lofty goal.\n\n\tAnother issue is whether a uniform package of benefits should be available nationwide. Under some proposals, benefits would be determined on a state-by-state basis; under others, the federal government would establish a national benefit standard for the plans of employers. These proposals typically call for the abolishment of state benefit mandates.\n\nDoes Cost Containment Harm Quality?\n\n\tAlthough there are undoubtedly inefficiencies in the health care system, some of these inefficiencies have been addressed in recent years. For example, hospitals, faced with limits on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, have had to operate in a more cost-effective manner. However, future efforts to control costs probably need to be more severe and may come with a high price. Americans arguably have the best and most innovative health care system in the world. Can this quality continue if prices are controlled? Or will it continue only for those who have additional resources to pay? Control of costs, if taken beyond a certain point, will lead to the situation that exists in most countries with national health insurance programs-rationing of medical care. Questions like the following will then need to be answered: Should organ transplants be limited to persons under age 50? Should very expensive health care continue to be provided to premature babies who have a less than 25 percent chance of survival? To what extent should medical treatment be provided to persons with terminal illnesses? Will controls on the cost of prescription drugs eliminate the resources needed to develop the next generation of medicines?\n\nAre Employer Mandates the Proper Approach?\n\nEmployer Mandate\n\n\tNational health care proposals differ with respect to the employer's role in making coverage available to its employees. Some proposals argue for an employer mandate, which would require virtually all employers to make coverage\navailable to employees (including part-time employees) and their dependents and to pay a portion of the cost. Under all such proposals, there are additional programs for the unemployed and subsidies to some employers for whom the cost exceeds a certain limit. However, small employers would be hit hard by most of these proposals and have lobbied against employer mandates. There is some support for the argument that the cost of employer mandates would result in some small employers going out of business unless subsidies accompanied such mandates.\n\n\tOne major argument for employer mandates is that the alternative is a government-run program with its accompanying bureaucracy.\n\nWhat Is the Role of Medicare and Medicaid?\n\n\tMany differences exist over the role of Medicare and Medicaid in health care reform. Although some argue for a single system to cover all Americans, opponents argue that the Medicare and Medicaid programs serve specific groups and are working reasonably well. Why alter the part of the system that is already closest to the concept of universal coverage?\n\n\tNational health insurance proposals were much more likely to fold Medicaid recipients into a new program than they were to include Medicare recipients. This fact reflects the reality that tinkering with Medicare can have grave consequences because of the high turnout of older voters. The Affordable Care Act, as it is being implemented, expands eligibility in Medicaid to those who are below 133 percent of the federal poverty level by eliminating the requirement to have dependent children. Medicare also has several changes being implemented by the act.\n\nPossible Approaches\n\n\tIn a debate like the continuing one occurring over health insurance, new proposals are continually replacing old ones, and those that are around for any length of time undergo revision. For this reason, the discussion is general and describes the following generic approaches that have been discussed in recent years:\n\n\t\t\u2022 managed competition plans \n\t\t\u2022 single-payer plans\n\t\t\u2022 reform on a state-by-state basis \n\t\t\u2022 reform of the current system\n\n\tIt is important to remember that the use of any one of these approaches does not dictate a specific national health insurance plan. Within each approach, there is wide latitude to address many of the issues that discussed in the previous pages.\n\nManaged Competition Plans\n\nManaged Competition\n\nHealth Insurance Purchasing Cooperative (HIPC)\n\n\tThe term managed competition received considerable attention because it was the approach taken by the Clinton administration in designing its initial national health insurance proposal. The basic philosophy behind the idea of managed competition is that competition for medical expense insurance should be based on price rather than on the risk characteristics of those needing coverage. A managed competition plan would create a new type of organization-often referred to as a health insurance purchasing cooperative (HIPC). An HIPC would act as a purchasing agent and negotiate with insurance companies, HMOs, and other providers of medical expense coverage to offer a menu of different insurance plans to employers and individuals who subscribe to the HIPC. In addition to price, subscribers would receive information on each plan's quality of care. Note that some states have now adopted HIPCs. In addition, this is similar to the approach used by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n\n\tUnder most managed care proposals, HIPCs would be established under state regulation, would operate in a specified geographic region, and would not compete with each other. Some proposals require all employers to be subscribers to the HIPC in their area, which would be the only source for providing coverage to employees. To varying degrees, however, most managed competition proposals allow larger employers to establish their own HIPCs for self-funding benefits.\n\n\tAll employers (and also unemployed and self-employed persons) would be eligible for coverage from the HIPC, and there would be no preexisting-conditions provisions for employees. Some proposals use community rating, which would establish a set price per covered person for the plan selected. Other proposals would adjust rates by such factors as age or gender.\n\n\tAlthough individual proposals for national health insurance may vary, there is nothing in the basic idea of managed competition that dictates any specific benefit package, level of employer contribution to the cost of the coverage for employees, or government price controls.\n\n\tThere are many critics of managed competition. Because it involves a fundamental change in the delivery of health care, managed competition has been opposed by many physicians who fear that their ability to treat patients will come under government control. Insurance agents have been particularly vocal because their role would be virtually eliminated. However, there would still be a modest role for benefit consultants to advise employers on the selection of alternative plans under the HIPC. HIPCs are also unappealing to persons who are not already in managed care plans and wish to retain control over their choice of medical practitioners. Employers that operate in many regions would also be required to deal with several HIPCs.\n\n\tManaged competition has also been criticized for creating another level of health care bureaucracy by the formation of HIPCs and the additional regulation that would be needed. It has been suggested that this might also negate the effect of any cost-saving features of the approach.\n\nSingle-Payer Plans\n\n\tSeveral proposals for national health insurance can be categorized as single-payer plans, which is the approach taken in Canada and many European countries. Under a single-payer plan, a single program run by the government automatically covers everyone, and everyone has the same benefit package. Some proposals have a totally federal program; other proposals call for each state to administer the program for its residents, but under specific federal guidelines.\n\n\tSingle-payer plans eliminate the employer's role in providing medical expense benefits to employees. The agent's role is also eliminated unless the plan benefits are at a level where there is a market for supplemental insurance. However, most proposals call for very comprehensive coverage with few if any copayments.\n\n\tMost proposals for a single-payer plan call for the financing of the program through taxes rather than premiums. Although the taxes could take a variety of forms, a Social Security type of payroll tax on both employers and employees is most commonly mentioned.\n\n\tIn some respects, a single-payer plan can be viewed as a Medicare-type program that covers everyone. The single-payer approach, however, goes farther and calls for more government control of medical care. A national health care budget would be established, and reimbursement schedules to providers would be determined at the state or federal level within the constraints of this budget. In addition, the budget would result in the government's exercising controls over the types of treatment available for specific conditions and the extent to which monies would be spent on new technology and medical facilities. In effect, a single-payer plan rejects market forces as the allocator of medical resources and implies that there would be some rationing of medical care under government guidelines.\n\n\tAlthough the broad nature of a single-payer plan would result in additional costs because of increased demand for health care, efficiencies associated with the approach would offset these costs. For example, the claim process would be dramatically streamlined, and marketing costs would virtually disappear. Furthermore, the widespread availability of medical care would probably lead to more preventive care, which would minimize the need for more expensive treatments in the future.\n\n\tMuch of the support for a single-payer approach to the health care problem arises from the perception that Americans have of the Canadian health care system. There is no doubt that many Canadians believe they have a good system, but just as in the United States the system is becoming a subject of national debate. Costs are lower than in the United States, but they are increasing at a rapid rate. Moreover, there is rationing of care, which can lead to lengthy waits to schedule surgeries. As a result, some Canadians come to the United States for treatment that privately insured Americans can receive on demand. These facts, coupled with the American public's concern over bigger government and its bureaucracy, make the adoption of a single-payer approach unlikely.\n\nState Reform\n\n\tUntil the 2008 elections, there was increasing support in Congress for the idea that national health insurance should take the form of a series of state programs rather than a single federal program. This support came from many newer members of Congress who were more amenable to having the states rather than the federal government solve some of the nation's problems. Support also came from some state governors. Some other members of Congress, who might otherwise prefer a federal solution, felt that reform at the state level was preferable to partisan debate at the national level with little chance of any real reform.\n\n\tAs a result of the 2008 elections and a much more liberal Congress, the pendulum has swung back to the federal government playing a major role in health care reform. However, this does not necessarily mean that the solution will not also involve the states. To give the states flexibility in health care reform, it will be necessary for the states to be free of such constraints as ERISA. Without an ERISA preemption, states will be unable to apply reform to employees who are in self-funded plans. Employers who self-fund benefits, particularly those who have been successful with cost containment, will be reluctant to support such a change in federal law because it may ultimately result in increased costs, particularly if a state adopts some type of community rating. Self-funded employers that operate in many states would also be burdened by having to comply with each state's mandates.\n\nReform of the Current System\n\n\tPrior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, 1996 and 1997 saw the most far-reaching federal legislation to affect medical expense insurance in many years. It was clear to all sides that the public strongly supported certain changes. Although the overall result was not a basic restructuring of the health care system, it clearly was significant reform and change.\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n\n\tThe primary piece of health care legislation was the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Although the following contains only a discussion of the act's effect on the increased availability of medical expense coverage, other provisions of the act can be summarized as follows:\n\n\t\t\u2022 increased portability of medical expense coverage \n\t\t\u2022 expansion of eligibility for COBRA benefits\n\t\t\u2022 broader tax deductibility of medical expense premiums for the self-employed\n\t\t\u2022 favorable income tax treatment for long-term care insurance \n\t\t\u2022 requirements for wellness programs\n\t\t\u2022 administrative rules pertaining to privacy, security, and transaction standards for personal health information\n\n\tHIPAA was not the only legislation to affect group medical expense coverage. The Mental Health Parity Act requires that many employers provide increased benefits for mental illnesses. In addition, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act may increase the length of inpatient benefits for childbirth in many cases. The Children's Health Insurance Program has resulted in far fewer children lacking medical expense insurance. It is interesting to note that much of this federal legislation and many recent state health reforms (such as the establishment of HIPCs and small-group legislation) incorporate aspects of the original Clinton proposal for national health insurance.\n\n\tThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act was passed in 2003. This act not only reformed Medicare but also paved the way for the establishment of health savings accounts.\n\n\tThere were many possible aspects of federal reform, and numerous proposals suggested and even introduced in Congress. In late 2008, the Congressional Budget Office prepared a lengthy report identifying 115 specific options and analyzing their effect and cost. The 221-page report, Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals, is available on line at www.cbo.gov./doc.cfm?index=9924.\n\n\tJust a few of the proposals discussed in the report include the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 fostering the formation of association health plans (AHPs). These would allow small employers to band together to purchase medical expense benefits. The plans would be free of state regulation, so that one standard policy could be offered across the country.\n\n\t\t\u2022 imposing a pay-or-play requirement on large employers. In effect, they would be required to either offer their employees medical expense coverage or pay a financial penalty.\n\n\t\t\u2022 establishing a national high-risk pool\n\n\t\t\u2022 establishing a national reinsurance program to provide subsidies to insurers and employers for providing coverage to early retirees\n\n\t\t\u2022 creating a voucher program to expand medical expense coverage\n\n\t\t\u2022 replacing the income tax exclusion for employment-based health insurance with a deduction\n\n\t\t\u2022 expanding eligibility for an above-the line deduction for medical expense insurance premiums\n\n\t\t\u2022 disallowing new contributions to health saving accounts. This option is supported by those who are not in favor of health savings accounts.\n\n\t\t\u2022 allowing health insurance plans with higher coinsurance to be used with health savings accounts. This option has support from some of those who do favor health savings accounts.\n\n\t\t\u2022 raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67\n\n\t\t\u2022 allowing individuals at least age 62 to buy into Medicare\n\n\t\t\u2022 funding research to compare the effectiveness of treatment options\n\n\t\t\u2022 imposing excise taxes on such items as sugar-sweetened beverages and cigarettes to encourage healthier behavior\n\n\t\t\u2022 increasing the look-back period for transfer of assets to Medicaid\n\n\tSeveral of these proposals were incorporated into 201O's health care reform legislation.\n\nIncreased Availability of Medical Expense Coverage\n\n\tHIPAA contains several provisions designed to help both employees and employers obtain coverage more easily. Portions of the act deal with preexisting conditions and the issue of eligibility. The discussion here focuses on the plans covered by the act and portions of the act that address nondiscrimination rules, special enrollment periods, renewability, and small groups.\n\nCovered Plans\n\n\tThe act applies to group health plans that cover two or more employees, whether insured or self-funded. However, the act does not apply to a long list of excepted benefits. The following are excepted benefits in all circumstances:\n\n\t\t\u2022 coverage for accidents, including accidental death and dismemberment\n\t\t\u2022 disability income insurance\n\t\t\u2022 liability insurance\n\t\t\u2022 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance\n\t\t\u2022 workers' compensation or similar insurance \n\t\t\u2022 automobile medical payments insurance\n\t\t\u2022 credit-only insurance, such as mortgage insurance \n\t\t\u2022 coverage for on-site medical clinics\n\n\tIn addition, certain other benefits are excepted benefits under specified circumstances:\n\n\t\t\u2022 limited vision or dental benefits, long-term care insurance, nursing home insurance, home health care insurance, and insurance for community-based care if these benefits are offered separately rather than as an integral part of a medical expense plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 coverage for a specific disease or illness or for hospital or other fixed indemnity insurance if the benefits (1) are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance and (2) are not coordinated with other coverage under a medical expense plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 Medicare supplement insurance or other similar supplemental coverage if the policy is offered as a separate insurance policy rather than as a continuation of coverage under a plan that also covers active employees.\n\n\t\t\u2022 health flexible spending accounts (FSAs) under cafeteria plans as long as (1) the employee has other coverage available under a group health plan of the employer and (2) the maximum payment under the FSA for the year does not exceed the greater of two times the employee's salary reduction or the amount of the employee's salary reduction plus $500. Virtually all FSAs meet these requirements.\n\n\tWith one exception, all employers-including the federal government- must comply with the act's provisions. State and local government plans can elect to be excluded from most of HIPAA's provisions.\n\nNondiscrimination Rules\n\n\tThe act prohibits the use of any of the following health-related factors as a reason to exclude an employee or dependent from coverage under a group health plan or to charge the individual or dependent a higher premium:\n\n\t\t\u2022 health status\n\n\t\t\u2022 medical condition, including both physical and mental condition \n\n\t\t\u2022 claims experience\n\n\t\t\u2022 receipt of health care\n\n\t\t\u2022 medical history\n\n\t\t\u2022 genetic information. (In 2008, Congress passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which further restricted the use of genetic information by employers. Employers will no longer be able to use genetic information to discriminate against an employee with respect to terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. This applies to compensation, which includes all type of employee benefits. Various parts of the act will be implemented in 2009 and 2010.)\n\n\t\t\u2022 evidence of insurability, including conditions caused by domestic violence and participation in such activities as motorcycling, snowmobiling, all-terrain vehicle riding, horseback riding, skiing, and other similar activities\n\n\t\t\u2022 disability\n\n\tIt is important to note that these factors relate to coverage for specific individuals under a plan. The overall plan itself (except for plans in the small-group market, as explained later) can still be subject to traditional underwriting standards. In addition, a group health plan is not required to offer any specific benefits. It can also limit benefit levels or exclude coverage for certain types of injuries as long as any limitations or exclusions apply uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and are not directed at individual participants based on any health factor. However, the act does not prohibit different benefit structures for different groups of employment classifications. Examples of acceptable classifications are full-time versus part-time, different geographic locations, membership in a collective bargaining unit, date of hire, length of service, current employee versus former employee status, and different occupations.\n\n\tThe act does not restrict the amount an insurance company or other provider of health care coverage can charge an employer for coverage. The act does allow an employer or provider of medical expense coverage to establish premium discounts or to modify copayments or deductibles for persons who participate in bona fide programs of health promotion or disease prevention.\n\nSpecial Enrollment Periods\n\n\tFor various reasons, employees and their dependents may elect not to enroll in an employer's plan when they are initially eligible for coverage. For example, a new employee may have coverage under a spouse's plan. The act requires that employers allow these employees and dependents to enroll in the employer's plan under any one of several specified circumstances as long as the employee had previously stated in writing that the original declination was because there was other coverage. However, the requirement of a written declination does not apply unless the employer requires it and notifies the employee that it is a requirement for future coverage. The following are the circumstances for special enrollment:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The other coverage was lost because of loss of eligibility under the other plan. This loss of eligibility can result from such circumstances as divorce, the spouse's termination of employment, or the spouse's death.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The other coverage was lost because employer contributions for the coverage terminated.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The other coverage was COBRA coverage that is exhausted.\n\n\tThe employee has 30 days following the loss of coverage to request enrollment in the employer's plan.\n\n\tIn addition, new dependents (including children placed for adoption) are also eligible for coverage under special enrollment rules. The employee must enroll the dependent within 30 days of his or her gaining dependent status. Coverage for a new spouse must become effective no later than the first month beginning after the employee's request; coverage for children must go into effect as of the date of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.\n\nGuaranteed Renewability\n\n\tAll group health insurers must renew existing health insurance coverage unless one of the following circumstances exists:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The plan sponsor failed to pay premiums or the issuer of health insurance coverage failed to receive timely premiums.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The plan sponsor performed an act of fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The plan sponsor failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules as long as applicable state or federal law permits these rules. For example, an employer might fail to maintain a minimum required percentage of participation under a plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 There is no covered employee who lives or works in the service area of a network plan, such as an HMO.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The employer is no longer a member of the association that sponsors a plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The issuer of coverage ceases to offer coverage in a particular market. The issuer must notify each plan sponsor, participant, and beneficiary at least 90 days prior to the discontinuation of coverage, and the issuer must offer each plan sponsor the option to purchase other health insurance coverage the issuer currently offers to a group health plan in the market. If the issuer exits the market entirely, the period of notice is 180 days, and the issuer cannot reenter the market and sell health insurance coverage for at least 5 years.\n\n\tSimilar rules require multiemployer plans and multiple-employer welfare arrangements to renew coverage for employers. It also establishes guaranteed-issue and renewal rules for the individual marketplace.\n\nGuaranteed Issue for Small-Group Plans\n\n\tWith some exceptions, the act requires that insurers, HMOs, and other providers of health care coverage which operate in the small-group market accept all small employers-defined as employers with 2 to 50 employees-that apply for coverage. In addition, all employees of small employers and their dependents must be accepted for coverage as long as they enroll during the period in which they are first eligible. This rule is in line with the small-group legislation of many states. However, some states have similar rules for groups as small as one employee, and some stipulate an upper limit of 25, above which the small-group legislation does not apply.\n\n\tExceptions to this guaranteed-issue requirement are allowed if a provider of coverage in the small-group market has inadequate network or financial capacity or if applicants are not in a plan's service area.\n\n\tMinimum participation or employer contribution requirements are acceptable if applicable state law permits them.\n\nInterrelationship of State and Federal Legislation\n\n\tFor the most part, the federal legislation does not preempt state laws pertaining to group medical expense insurance (which might be more stringent than HIPAA) except in those situations where any state standard or requirement would prevent the application of the federal law. To prevent any preemption, many states have had to make some modifications to their laws and regulations.\n\n\tThe act permits a state to enforce the act's provisions with respect to insurance companies and other medical expense providers. However, the federal government can take over enforcement if a state does not perform its duties. In that case, enforcement is by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Labor has enforcement power for the act's provisions as they apply to group health plans themselves, including the act's portability provisions. When there is federal enforcement, the penalty for noncompliance can be up to $100 per day for each individual with respect to whom a plan or issuer is in noncompliance.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Eligibility for Medical Expense Coverage\n\n\tThe eligibility requirements for medical expense coverage are essentially the same as those for group term insurance-an employee must usually be in a covered classification, must satisfy any probationary period, and must be full time. Coverage is usually not available to part-time employees.\n\tIt is important to note the effect of HIPAA on actively-at-work provisions. HIPAA does not allow an actively-at-work provision in its typical sense unless an employer treats persons who are absent due to health conditions (such as employees taking sick leave) as if they are actively at work. However, group health plans may condition eligibility on commencement of employment.\nTherefore, an employee who fails to start work on what would otherwise have been his or her initial day of employment, even because of health reasons, can be denied coverage until he or she begins work. If there is a probationary period, such as 90 days of continuous employment, a plan cannot treat an absence from work for a health reason as a break in this period.\n\tEligibility requirements may vary somewhat if an employer changes carriers for a plan's benefits. Note that the following discussion refers to the employer's plan with benefits paid by the previous carrier as the old plan and the employer's plan with benefits paid by the new carrier as the new plan. In actuality, the employer still has the same medical expense plan. It has only been modified with the use of a new insurance carrier or other financing mechanism and, possibly, a different level of benefits. This is a material modification to a group health plan, and ERISA requires that the plan administrator notify participants of this change by a summary of material modification.\n\tEven though only a few states have adopted them, most insurers follow the procedures established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Group Coverage Discontinuance and Replacement Model Regulation for medical expense coverage (and possibly other group coverages). This regulation stipulates that a new plan provide coverage to anyone who (1) was covered under the old plan at the date it was discontinued and (2) is in an eligible classification of the new plan.\n\tThere are two final points about the transfer of coverage. First, the new plan will not pay benefits for expenses that the old plan covered under an extension-of-benefits provision (discussed later). Second, when applying any deductibles or probationary periods under the new plan, credit is often given for the satisfaction (or partial satisfaction) of the same or similar provisions during the last 3 months of the old plan. For example, assume that the employer transfers coverage in the middle of a calendar year and the new plan contains the same $500-a-year calendar deductible as the old plan. If an employee has already satisfied the deductible under the old plan, no new deductible is required for the remainder of the calendar year provided that (1) the expenses used to satisfy the deductible under the old plan satisfy the deductible under the new plan, and (2) the expenses were incurred during the last 3 months of the old plan. If only $340 of the $500 was incurred during those last 3 months, the employee is subject to an additional $160 deductible under the new plan for the remainder of the calendar year.\n\nDependent Eligibility for Medical Expense Benefits\n\tTypically, the same medical expense benefits that a plan provides for an eligible employee are also available for that employee's dependents. Conversely, dependent coverage is rarely available unless the employee also has coverage. As long as an employee authorizes any necessary payroll deductions, dependent coverage is typically effective on the same date as the employee's coverage. If the employee does not elect coverage under\na contributory plan within 31 days after dependents are eligible, future coverage is available only during an open enrollment period or when the dependents provide satisfactory evidence of insurability. Newly acquired dependents (by birth, marriage, or adoption) are eligible for coverage as of the date they gain dependent status. As a rule, the employee must take a positive action to enroll such new dependents in order for their coverage to become effective. However, a newborn child has automatic coverage for the first 31 days following birth.\n\ndependent\n\tThe term dependent most commonly refers to an employee's spouse who is not legally separated from the\nemployee and any dependent children (including stepchildren and adopted children) under the age of 26. Under the ACA mandates, student status, tax dependency, employment status, marital status, and other requirements are no longer relevant to continue a dependent child's coverage to age 26.\n\tIn addition, coverage may also continue (and is required to be continued in some states) for children who are incapable of earning their own living because of a physical or mental infirmity. Such children are considered dependents as long as this condition exists, but periodic proof of the condition is normally required. If an employee has dependent coverage, all newly acquired dependents (by birth, marriage, or adoption) have automatic coverage.\n\tA few plans define \"dependent\" more widely to include grandchildren, parents, and siblings who live with the employee.\n\nFederal Rules for Children's Medical Coverage\n\tFederal legislation in the early 1990s brought the federal government into the picture with a series of rules designed to better guarantee that benefits are available to children. Some of these rules pertain to eligibility.\n\nMedical Coverage for Adopted Children\n\tIf a work-related group medical expense plan provides coverage for dependent children of participants or beneficiaries, it must provide benefits for adopted children or children placed for adoption under the same terms and conditions that apply to natural children. For purposes of this change, a child is defined as a person under the age of 18 at the time of adoption or placement for adoption. Placement for adoption occurs at the time in the adoption process when the plan participant or beneficiary assumes and retains the legal duty for the total or partial support of a child to be adopted.\n\tIn addition to providing coverage, a plan cannot restrict benefits because of a preexisting condition at the time coverage is effective as long as the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the parent is eligible for plan participation.\n\nMedical Child Support Orders\n\tOne goal of the legislation was to shift Medicaid costs from the government to the private sector by requiring employer-provided benefit plans to pick up more of the cost of providing medical expense benefits to the children of divorced and separated parents. As a result, employer-sponsored medical expense plans must recognize qualified medical child support orders by providing benefits for a participant's children in accordance with the requirements of such an order.\n\nmedical child support order\n\tA medical child support order is a court judgment, decree, or order that (1) provides for child support with respect to the child of a group plan participant or provides benefit coverage to such a child, is ordered under state domestic relations law, and relates to benefits under the plan or (2) enforces a state medical support law enacted under the new Medicaid rules discussed below. The support order then becomes qualified if it meets two additional requirements. First, the order must create or recognize the right of the child to receive benefits to which the plan participant or other beneficiary is entitled under a group plan. Second, the order must include such information as the name and last known mailing address of the plan participant and the child, a reasonable description of the coverage to be provided, the period for which coverage must be provided, and each plan to which the order applies. However, a qualified order cannot require a plan to offer any benefits that are not already available under the plan unless the benefits are necessary to meet the requirements of a state medical child support law established under the Social Security Act.\n\tBecause of a lack of uniformity among medical child support orders and difficulty for employers in determining whether they are qualified, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services have jointly developed a National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) that state courts and agencies must use. When properly completed, the NMSN meets the requirements of a qualified medical child support order. The NMSN has two parts, both of which are sent to the employer. Within 20 days, the employer must respond to the agency that sent the order if coverage is not available for any reason. If coverage is available, part B of the form must be sent to the plan administrator if it is not the employer. Within 40 days after receiving the NMSN, the employer's plan must provide coverage for the dependent child. If the plan administrator is not the employer, the administrator must notify the employer of the amount to withhold from the worker's pay.\n\tInformation about medical child support orders is on the Web site of U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Administration for Children & Families: acf.hhs.gov.\n\nMedicaid Rules\n\tThe legislation encouraged the states (under threat of losing some Medicaid reimbursement) to adopt a series of laws relating to medical child support. One of these laws prohibits plan administrators from denying enrollment of a child under a parent's insurance plan on any of the following grounds:\n\u2022 The child was born out of wedlock.\n\u2022 The child is not claimed as a dependent on the parent's federal income tax return.\n\u2022 The child does not reside with the parent or in the insurer's service area.\n\tIn addition, a second law provides that if a court orders a parent to provide medical support, the parent's plan must enroll the child without regard to any enrollment restrictions. If the parent fails to enroll the child, enrollment can be made by the child's other parent or by the state Medicaid agency. The employer is required to withhold from the parent's compensation any payments that the parent must make toward the cost of coverage.\n\nPortability Provisions in HIPAA\n\tSome of the most significant parts of HIPAA are the provisions dealing with portability of medical expense coverage. These provisions do not allow employees to take specific insurance from one job to another; they put limitations on preexisting-conditions exclusions and allow employees to use evidence of prior insurance coverage to reduce or eliminate the length of any preexisting-conditions exclusion when employees move to another medical expense plan. These provisions should minimize job lock for employees by eliminating the fear that medical expense coverage will be lost if an employee changes jobs.\n\tThe portability provisions apply to almost all group medical expense insurance plans (either insured or self-funded) as long as they have at least two active participants on the first day of the plan year.\n\nHIPAA Limitations on Preexisting Conditions\n\tRestrictions for preexisting conditions are limited to a maximum of 12 months (18 months for late enrollees). In addition, a plan must reduce the period for preexisting conditions for prior creditable coverage as defined below. However, there is nothing in the act that prohibits an employer from imposing a probationary (waiting) period before a new employee is eligible to enroll in a medical expense plan. A plan must apply any probationary period uniformly without regard to the health status of potential plan participants or beneficiaries. In addition, the probationary period must run concurrently with any preexisting-conditions period. For example, an employee might be subject to a preexisting-conditions period of 7 months because of prior coverage. If the employer's plan had a 3-month probationary period for enrollment, the length of the preexisting-conditions period after enrollment could be only 4 months. The act permits an HMO to have an affiliation period of up to 2 months (3 months for late enrollees) if the HMO does not impose a preexisting-conditions provision and if the HMO applies the affiliation period without regard to health status-related factors.\n\tThe act defines a preexisting condition as a mental or physical condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the 6-month period ending on the enrollment date. No preexisting-conditions exclusions can apply to pregnancy or to newborn children or, if under age 18, to newly adopted children or children newly placed for adoption as long as they have creditable coverage within 30 days of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. In addition, the act prohibits the use of genetic information as a preexisting condition unless there is a diagnosis of a preexisting medical condition related to the information.\n\tThe 12-month limitation for preexisting conditions applies if an employee enrolls when initially eligible for coverage. It also applies in the case of special enrollment periods that are required by the act for employees and dependents who lose other coverage and for new dependents. Anyone who does not enroll in an employer's plan during the first period he or she is eligible or during a special enrollment period is a late enrollee and can be subject to a preexisting-conditions period of 18 months.\n\nCreditable Coverage\n\tThe act defines creditable coverage as coverage under an individual policy, an employer-provided group plan (either insured or self-funded), an HMO, Medicare, Medicaid, or various public plans, regardless of whether a plan provides coverage to a person as an individual, an employee, or a dependent. However, coverage is not creditable if there has been a break in coverage of 63 or more days.\n\tIn determining the length of a person's preexisting-conditions period, a plan must subtract the period of prior creditable coverage.\n\nEXAMPLE\nAssume that an employer's plan has a preexisting-conditions period of 12 months. If a new employee has 12 months or more of creditable coverage, the preexisting-conditions period is satisfied. lf the period of creditable coverage is only 7 months, then the preexisting-conditions period runs 5 more months. Note, however, that if the employee has been without coverage for at least 63 days between jobs, the full preexisting-conditions period applies.\n\n\tEmployers have two ways in which they can apply creditable coverage: on a blanket basis to all categories of medical expense coverage or on a benefit-specific basis. For example, if an employee had prior coverage that excluded prescription drugs, this particular coverage could be subject to the full preexisting-conditions period, and the period for other benefits would be reduced because creditable coverage had applied to them. For administrative ease, an employer usually picks the first method.\n\tThe act requires that a plan administrator automatically give persons losing group coverage a certificate that specifies the period of creditable coverage under the plan they are leaving, including any period of COBRA coverage. In addition, the employer must provide the certificate to anyone who requests it within 24 months after coverage ceased. If an individual is eligible for COBRA coverage, the plan administrator must provide the certificate no later than the time when a COBRA election notice must be provided. In other cases, the employer must provide the certificate within a reasonable time. This certificate of creditable coverage must include the following information:\n\u2022 the date the certificate was issued\n\u2022 the name of the health plan that provided the coverage\n\u2022 the name and identification number of any individual(s) whose coverage has ceased\n\u2022 the name, address, and telephone number of the administrator responsible for the certificate\n\u2022 a statement that the individual(s) had at least 18 months of creditable coverage\n\u2022 the date any probationary period began and the date coverage began\n\u2022 the date coverage ended\n\tOne certificate may include coverage for the employee and all dependents, or the employer may issue separate certificates for each person.\n\tSample certificates of creditable coverage are readily available, including blank ones that are downloadable from the Internet. This has led to a high incidence of fraudulent certificates. As a result, many plans contact the prior employer to verify the accuracy of any certificates they are given.\n\nState Options\n\tThe act's provisions on portability generally override state laws. However, they do not override state laws that provide greater portability. For example, a state might require a look-back period of less than 6 months, or the maximum preexisting-conditions period could be less than 12 months.\n\nBenefits for Domestic Partners\ndomestic partners\n\tIn the mid-1980s, the plans of a few employers began to make coverage available for unmarried domestic partners. For example, one plan covers unmarried couples as long as they live together, show financial interdependence and joint responsibility for each other's common welfare, and consider themselves life partners. This type of requirement is typical, as is the additional requirement that the employee's relationship must have lasted some specified minimum period, such as 6 or 12 months. The employee must usually give the employer an affidavit that these requirements have been satisfied. A domestic partner with benefits is often able to enroll his or her dependent children under the plan.\n\tMost surveys indicate that at over 50 percent of large employers now provide medical expense benefits to domestic partners, as do many smaller employers. (Some employers also offer other types of employee benefits.) Most plans provide benefits to domestic partners engaged in either heterosexual or homosexual relationships. Some plans provide benefits only to persons of the opposite gender of the employee, and a small number of plans limit benefits only to persons of the same gender. The rationale for the latter is that persons of opposite genders can obtain benefits by marrying, whereas this option is not available in most states to persons of the same gender. Most plans that provide benefits for domestic partners require the partners to live together, but a few plans provide benefits even if the partners live apart. The rationale used is that a cohabitation requirement is not necessary for a married partner to receive benefits.\n\tIn some cases, plans provide domestic partners benefits to persons who are related. For example, benefits may be available to a parent or sibling who lives with and receives support from an employee.\n\tThe number of employees obtaining coverage for domestic partners has been relatively small, with many employers experiencing enrollment of less than one percent when only partners of the same gender are covered. Some employers have experienced enrollment of up to 5 percent if partners of either gender are covered. (Enrollments of partners of the opposite gender are more than double the enrollments of partners of the same gender.) This low enrollment is due primarily to two factors. First, the domestic partner is probably also working and has medical expense coverage from his or her employer. Second, some employees are unwilling to make their living arrangement or sexual orientation known in the workplace.\n\n\n\n"

If they are absent on the first day that the plan is in effect, they become covered the next day that they are actively at work.\n    Pointer: An insurer may agree to cover all employees on the plan's effective date even if they are on vacation, on leave, not scheduled to work that day, absent due to illness, or on temporary layoff.\n    Waiting period. New employees enrolling in an existing plan typically have to work a specified period of time or number of hours on a regular basis before becoming eligible for coverage. This waiting period varies in length from employer to employer but is often around three months. Group health plans and insurers cannot impose waiting periods that exceed 90 days (Reference 1 below).\n    Once an employee is eligible for the plan, the employee usually has a limited time period in which to enroll. An employee or eligible family member who does not enroll when first eligible, but later chooses to join the plan, may have to undergo a medical examination, and may not be covered for preexisting conditions.\n    Dependent coverage. Dependent coverage usually begins with the enrollment of the employee so that when the employee receives coverage, so do eligible dependents whom the employee has enrolled. An employee may be required to provide evidence of insurability in order to cover dependents who are not initially covered, unless the dependent is a newborn infant.\n    Adopted children. Group health plans that provide coverage for dependent children must treat children placed with participants or beneficiaries for adoption in the same manner as natural children. This rule applies from the time the child is placed for adoption, even if that placement ultimately fails to result in an adoption. In addition, at the time the child is placed for adoption and becomes covered under a participant's health plan, the plan may not restrict coverage solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the child  (Reference 2 below).\n    Domestic partners. Some health plans define the term \"family\" broadly enough to include domestic partners of employees. Not all domestic partners, however, meet state law requirements for spousal equivalents.\n    Some employers have extended health benefits to domestic partners as spouses regardless of state laws.\n\nFor more information...\n    Rules governing coverage for domestic partners are addressed at KB-1 Topic 312.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2708, as added by Act Sec. 1201(4) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), as amended by Affordable Care Act Sec. 10103(b).\n2 ERISA Sec. 609(c); PWBA Opinion Letter 95-18A, 7/27/95.\n"

To offset the cost of the higher attained age premiums of the new LTC plan and to recognize that the insured has contributed to a LTC insurance plan, the active life reserves that the insured has accumulated will be transferred to the new plan, if the insured decides to transfer. Transferring the reserves enables the new LTC plan to reduce premiums for the transferee by subtracting a discount from the insured's attained age premiums or allows the LTC plan to use the insured's original issue age under their prior plan when setting premium rates.\n\n              The insurer(s) and the employer will need to negotiate the terms of the transfer, such as who is eligible to transfer, what type of underwriting is to be used, and how the new premiums will be calculated. Transfers and upgrades require a considerable amount of administrative effort, including a customized premium quote for the new plan, the tracking of who has elected to transfer, and, for a transfer between insurers, the reconciliation of the final transfer list between insurers. Thus, a transfer provision is often included only in larger employer LTC insurance policies.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Employee Benefit Marketing - Marketing Process\n\n\tAlthough the main goal of employee benefit marketing is to \"close the sale,\" the process involves two broad categories of activities: those that precede the sale and those that follow the sale. Presale activities include prospecting and the development and presentation of the group insurance proposal; postsale activities include the enrollment of employees and the actual installation, servicing, and renewal of the group insurance plan.\n\nProspecting\n\n\tProspecting is the first step in the marketing process. It involves persuading the employer (or the employer's broker or consultant) to accept a group insurance proposal from the insurance company (or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, HMO, PPO, or other provider of benefits or services). To be successful in actually presenting a proposal, prospecting also involves convincing the employer to provide the information necessary for the preparation of the proposal.\n\n\tThe process of prospecting varies for different segments of the group insurance market. For very small groups (under 10 or 15 employees), the plans marketed are often provided through MEWAs rather than through the traditional group insurance arrangements of insurance companies. Some of the sales activities in this segment are conducted by agents who specialize in group insurance, but a large portion of the sales activities is conducted by agents, brokers, or consultants whose primary sales activities take place in the individual marketplace. (In fact, the multiple-employer trusts of many insurance companies are actually considered for marketing purposes to be part of the product line of the individual insurance department rather than part of the group insurance department.) In many cases, the agent, broker, or consultant has had previous contacts with the employer concerning his or her personal or business insurance. However, it is also in the marketing to small groups that prospecting without known contacts (cold calling) is most likely to take place. Because of the modest premiums that these small groups generate, the agent, broker, or consultant usually carries out all of the sales activities (not just prospecting) with little direct involvement by representatives from the insurance company. It is also becoming increasingly common for insurers to issue proposals online. Because of the limited and relative inflexibility of products available for these small groups, training of agents, brokers, or consultants in this market is often oriented toward what products are available rather than toward group insurance planning in general.\n\n\tAs the size of groups increases, the chance of successful prospecting diminishes rapidly unless the agent, broker, or consultant (1) has a known contact who is a key person in an organization's decision-making process for group insurance matters and (2) has a more sophisticated understanding of group insurance. In these segments of the group insurance market, group representatives spend considerable time training agents, brokers, or consultants in the intricacies of group insurance and motivating them to develop prospects. For medium-sized groups, the agent, broker, or consultant may do the actual prospecting alone or with the group representative, or he or she may give qualified leads to the group representative who will perform this function.\n\n\tFor large groups, the situation is usually different because most large firms retain brokers or consultants to advise them on employee benefit programs and to aid them in the implementation of any decisions they make, including the placing of insurance coverages. Therefore, in this segment of the employee benefit market, prospecting is a two-part process. On one hand, there is intense competition among brokers and consultants to obtain the large firms as clients. On the other hand, clients are seldom successfully approached except through the broker or consultant. Therefore, the prospecting consists of group representatives (and representatives of the Blues and TPAs) who develop a close working relationship with the brokers or consultants to encourage the consideration of the group representatives' organization as a provider of group insurance or other employee benefit products or services.\n\nDeveloping the Proposal\n\nProposal\n\n\tIn the broadest sense, the development of a proposal for a benefit plan involves designing the benefit plan, calculating the premium rate or rates, and putting the proposal in its final form for presentation. Managed care and the availability of varied types of medical expense plans make proposal development especially challenging. Prior to managed care, an insurance company proposal could concentrate on coverage, benefits, and premium with a focus on its reputation for stability and prompt payment of claims. With the advent of managed care, proposals for medical expense coverage needed to address questions on the delivery of care under the managed care plan. Thus, the adequacy of the provider network-including its size, scope of services, and access-became prominent issues. Quality-including the credentials of providers, the accreditation of the plan, and performance measures of the plan-also became selection criteria for employers and their employees.\n\n\tIt is at the proposal stage of the marketing process that insurers do the majority of the underwriting for a case that they ultimately write. In effect, most insurance companies are saying that the benefit plan presented to the employer is probably acceptable to the company at the rates specified if the proposal leads to an application for coverage. However, most insurance companies \"hedge\" their positions and do not make an absolute commitment to write the coverage at this stage, except possibly for very large groups that the senior underwriting personnel have already reviewed . In many cases, field offices do the preliminary underwriting, and the proposal specifies that home office approval is necessary. In addition, the proposal includes any assumptions made in the preliminary underwriting that must be verified before the case is finally accepted. Finally, the proposal lists any underwriting conditions the employer or plan must meet before the insurer will write coverage (such as a certain percentage participation). Obtaining the necessary information for underwriting is often difficult for insurance companies, particularly when the agent, broker, or consultant primarily sells individual insurance. In the individual marketplace, the agent, broker, or consultant is accustomed to obtaining much of the necessary underwriting information at the time of application rather than before the sales presentation. Furthermore, the small employers that these agents, brokers, or consultants approach tend to be less sophisticated in group insurance matters than large employers are, and they often fail to see the necessity to provide detailed information at this point in the sales process. Consequently, for the sales process to continue past the prospecting stage, it is necessary that agents, brokers, and consultants recognize the importance of obtaining underwriting information and that they are willing and able to convey this importance to the employer.\n\n\tThe premium rates presented in the group insurance proposal are based on the employee census that the employer provides prior to the development of the proposal, and thus they are usually only tentative rates, a fact that is\nclearly stated in the proposal. The final premium rates are usually determined at the time a group insurance plan is installed and are based on the census of employees covered under the plan at its inception and possibly on the health of the employees.\n\n\tAlthough variations exist among insurance companies, most proposals contain at least the following information:\n\n\t\t\u2022 a description of each coverage included in the plan\n\t\t\u2022 a schedule of the tentative premium rates and the total premium for each coverage\n\t\t\u2022 a description of the persons eligible for coverage under the plan \n\t\t\u2022 any underwriting assumptions or conditions\n\t\t\u2022 details for servicing the plan, such as the procedures and facilities for administering claims\n\t\t\u2022 general information about the insurance company, including its size, financial strength, and products and services\n\n\tFor large group insurance cases, the proposal usually provides detailed information concerning the insurance company's retention and how the insurer calculates premium rates and reserves.\n\n\tAs with prospecting, the process of developing a proposal differs depending on whether coverage is for a small group, a large client that a broker or consultant controls, or a group that falls somewhere between these two extremes. For small groups that are written through MEWAs, the preparation of a proposal is usually a relatively simple matter. Because little or no flexibility is available for the coverages offered, the plan design consists primarily of an agent, broker, or consultant describing the available options and determining the employer's preferences. The agent, broker,' or consultant typically carries out the preliminary underwriting in the sense that it is his or her responsibility to determine whether the employer meets the trust's relatively rigid underwriting criteria. Because the rate structure is fairly simplified, the agent, broker, or consultant also determines the tentative premium based on the census data provided by the employer. The proposal typically consists of (1) a standard brochure or packet of information that describes the trust and its benefits and (2) a brief premium-calculation presentation that contains a list of the covered employees and the tentative premium the employer must pay for the initial coverage period.\n\n\tUnder some MEWAs, particularly when they are used to write coverage for groups larger than 10 or 15 employees, the insurance company or the administrator of the trust carries out the underwriting, premium calculations, and preparation of the proposal. Furthermore, as the size of the group written through the trust increases, the insurer may also request additional underwriting information (such as past claims history).\n\n\tThe situation is quite different for large groups. For group insurance cases that are not controlled by large brokers or consultants, the group representative plays a major role in the development of the proposal. It is usually the group representative, possibly along with the agent, broker, or consultant, who meets with the employer. Depending on the relationship between the employer and the agent, broker, or consultant, the group representative may have to put considerable effort into convincing the employer that it is worth the time to proceed with the proposal. This includes countering any of the employer's objections and convincing the employer that the insurance company can provide the products and services necessary to meet his or her needs. It is also at this time that the group representative must determine whether the employer is a serious prospect (that is, whether there is some possibility that the employer will add coverages or change insurers). In addition, the group representative must assess whether the employer is likely to meet the underwriting standards of the insurance company. For example, an insurance company may be unwilling to prepare a proposal for an employer that has a history of frequently changing insurers.\n\n\tIf the development of the proposal proceeds beyond the initial contact stage, the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative must (1) determine the employer's objectives, (2) aid the employer in designing the benefit plan for which the proposal will be made, and (3) obtain the information necessary to complete the development of the proposal. The data from the employer is then provided to the insurance company, usually through a field office. The rating and actual design of the proposal is normally conducted at the field office, but except for small cases the underwriting function is likely to be performed at the home office (or at a regional office in the case of large insurance companies). However, for very large cases, it is common for the insurance company to complete the entire process, not just the underwriting, at some level higher than the field office.\n\n\tTo complete the proposal, the insurance company obviously needs a description of the benefit plan desired and a census of employees (covered, not actively working, and on COBRA continuation) containing any information that affects underwriting or premium calculations. At a minimum, this information probably includes age and gender, but it may also include marital status, geographic location, income, and an indication of whether there are dependents. This census may have an actual list of employees by name or it may consist of aggregate data. In addition, most insurance companies commonly request the following information from the prospect or the prospect's agent, broker, or consultant:\n\n\t\t\u2022 the reason for transferring (unless it is a new case) \n\t\t\u2022 the nature of the employer's industry\n\t\t\u2022 a history of changes in the number of employees over the least 2 or 3 years\n\t\t\u2022 a statement indicating whether the plan is contributory and, if so, the amount of the employer's contribution\n\t\t\u2022 the length of time with the current insurer\n\t\t\u2022 premiums, rates, and claims experience with the current insurer for each line of coverage (usually for the previous 3 years)\n\t\t\u2022 a statement indicating whether collective bargaining is involved\n\t\t\u2022 copies of information about the current plan (such as benefit booklets or certificates of insurance)\n\t\t\u2022 the most recent premium statement from the current insurer\n\t\t\u2022 any renewal information from the current insurer for the past year or two\n\t\t\u2022 any ongoing large claims\n\n\tWhen a large broker or consultant controls a group insurance case, the broker or consultant designs the benefit plan in conjunction with the employer. In some cases, the business is placed with the existing insurance company or with a company that is either wanted by the employer or recommended by the broker or consultant. In other cases, bids are requested from several sources based on specifications prepared by the broker or consultant. In general, the bidding process is not open to every insurance company (or other provider of benefits) but is on an invitation basis. The decision about which insurance companies are invited to bid may be made at the discretion of the consultant or may be determined by the employer. For example, some employers may want bids only from companies headquartered in the same state.\n\n\tThe bidding specifications are accompanied by a cover letter that invites the insurance company to bid and states the last date on which bids may be received or postmarked. This date is usually from 45 to 90 days prior to the date coverage becomes effective. The specifications typically consist of a description of the plan desired, a census of employees, and any information the insurance company needs to properly underwrite and rate the case (see the previous list). Based on this data, the insurance company is asked to present a bid in the form of monthly and annual premiums for the coverage desired. In addition, a \"net cost illustration\" or \"retention exhibit\" is usually requested for a 2- to 5-year period. This illustration must show the projected premiums, incurred claims, retention, and dividends for each year, and it is often required to be based on assumptions listed in the specifications. The definitions of many of the preceding terms can vary.\n\n\tThe insurance company is typically confronted with a rigid set of specifications on which it must bid. However, some specifications are flexible and allow an insurance company to suggest changes in the specifications and to present a bid based on these suggestions. Furthermore, the specifications ask numerous questions about the insurance company's practices and ability to service the case. The following are only a few of the many questions that the specifications commonly contain:\n\n\t\t\u2022 How are incurred claims defined? \n\t\t\u2022 How is retention defined?\n\t\t\u2022 How is the level of reserves determined? \n\t\t\u2022 What is the interest rate credited to reserves?\n\t\t\u2022 How are catastrophic losses handled in the experience-rating process?\n\t\t\u2022 What charges are levied against the group's experience when coverage is converted?\n\t\t\u2022 For what period of time are rates guaranteed?\n\t\t\u2022 How much notice of rate changes is given at renewal? \n\t\t\u2022 What is the procedure for handling claims?\n\t\t\u2022 What services are provided in the area of cost containment?\n\t\t\u2022 If you are selected to provide coverage, on what date will the master contract and certificates of insurance be delivered?\n\t\t\u2022 Are there any additional costs for materials such as benefit booklets?\n\nChallenges with Managed Care Plans\n\n\tManaged care and the broad availability of varied medical expense plans and employer sponsorship of plan options often make proposal development especially challenging.\n\n\tPrior to managed care, an insurance company proposal could concentrate on coverage, benefits, and premium with a focus on its reputation for stability and prompt payment of claims. With the advent of managed care, proposals needed to address questions on the delivery of care under the managed care plan. Thus, the adequacy of the provider network, including its size, scope of services, and access became prominent issues. Quality, too, including the credentials of providers and the accreditation of the health plan overall by such organizations as NCQA, became paramount. All of these areas, along with performance measures, became plan selection criteria for employers and their employees.\n\n\tToday, few employers offer their employees only a single plan; many employers offer two or more options that allow employees to choose among traditional, HMO, POS, or PPO plans. Increasingly, these plans feature consumer-directed health plan funds that are associated with HRAs and/or HSAs.\n\n\tThus, insurers must carefully evaluate the underwriting implications and loss potential of employee selection among the options they offer based on differences in coverage, benefits, limitations on utilization and provider choice, and employee out-of-pocket payments. Such payments are determined not only by copayments, deductibles, and other self-responsible amounts, but also by the level of employer contribution to the premium of each option and the funding of consumer-directed health care accounts.\n\n\tA single insuring entity may offer all the options that an employer wishes to sponsor. If so, it eases the proposal burden of the insuring organization, whether a managed care organization or a traditional insurance company, to the extent that it is responsible for the group's total medical expenses. In this case, the insurer has a greater opportunity to recover losses due to adverse selection or other cost factors in one option through the positive experience under another or through overall premium adjustments for the overall account.\n\n\tHowever, in many cases, employers may select more than one company to offer the options. In such cases, the insurer must be particularly cautious about the plan features mentioned above that differentiate the available options and could create adverse selection against its options in favor of the options offered by another insurer, thereby making recovery of losses difficult.\n\nPresenting the Proposal\n\n\tThe successful presentation of a proposal leads to a sale that closes when the employer submits a signed application and the first periodic premium. For small groups, the agent, broker, or consultant makes the presentation of the proposal directly to the employer. In general, there is little room for negotiations, and the employer either accepts or rejects the initial proposal. In some cases, however, the proposal may contain two or three choices in plan design.\n\n\tFor large groups when the employer is dealt with directly, the agent, broker, or consultant may also present the proposal. However, because of the technical expertise necessary, the group representative is probably involved, and either presents the proposal or assists in its presentation. It is at this point that further negotiation on plan design and revision of the proposal are most likely to occur.\n\n\tWhen a large broker or consultant puts a group insurance case out to bid, there is usually no direct contact between the insurance company and the employer in the initial stages of the presentation. Rather, the group representative usually makes the presentation to the broker or consultant, who then evaluates all such proposals and makes a recommendation to the employer. This recommendation may be for the employer to select a specific proposal, but it often consists of presenting an employer with two or three proposals that best meet the employer's objectives. In this latter instance, the group representatives of the insurance companies involved are typically asked to meet with both the broker or consultant and the employer to further discuss the proposals. At this stage of the process, it is not unusual to give each company in contention a copy of the proposals that their competitors have submitted.\n\nEnrollment\n\n\tThe first step in the postsale activities of group marketing involves the enrollment of employees in the plan. If the plan is noncontributory, the employer must provide the insurance company with enrollment cards or a list of all employees to be covered and a certification that they have met all eligibility requirements, such as being actively at work or having satisfied a probationary period. If a plan is contributory, it must be properly marketed to the employees in order to encourage the maximum enrollment. In fact, unless the solicitation of employees is effective, the actual installation of the plan may never occur because of insufficient enrollment. Usually, the insurance company prepares the solicitation materials, such as letters or benefit booklets. For small employers, these may be standardized materials, but for large employers, they are custom designed. If a group is large enough, the insurance company may even prepare audiovisual presentations. Although the actual solicitation always involves the employer, it may consist only of the employer providing these materials to the employees. However, it is common for the employer to allow group meetings (during normal working hours) in which the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative can explain the plan to the employees and answer their questions.\n\n\tThe actual enrollment of employees either shortly follows or takes place simultaneously with the solicitation process. It consists of requesting the employees to complete enrollment forms supplied by the insurance company. These enrollment forms are usually brief, but they have more detail if the plan involves any individual underwriting of employees in addition to the usual group underwriting or if employees have a choice of alternative plans. Although the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative may conduct the actual enrollment, it is common for the employer's supervisory personnel to carry out this activity.\n\n\tAlthough proper marketing of a contributory plan to employees is crucial, a noncontributory plan must also be properly presented to employees if they are to fully understand and appreciate its provisions. In many cases, this means that the plan is presented to employees in virtually the same manner as if it were contributory.\n\nInstallation\n\n\tWhen the enrollment procedure is completed, the insurance company calculates the final premium rates and prepares the master contract (or joinder agreement in the case of a multiple-employer trust) and any other administrative materials for the employer as well as the certificates of insurance for the employees. The agent, broker, or consultant usually delivers these materials to small employers. In larger cases, the group representative, accompanied by the agent, broker, or consultant, usually performs the task. The agent, broker, consultant, or group representative thoroughly reviews the plan at this point with the employer and explains its administrative aspects, such as premium billings, claims procedures, and the enrollment and termination of employees. The importance of this meeting with the employer should not be ignored because the future success of a group insurance case is often a function of how well these administrative procedures are explained and thus understood by the employer.\n\n\tThe prominence of managed care plans makes the prompt and accurate performance of these installation procedures even more important. For example, enrollment (as well as termination of enrollment) may affect the payment of network providers, in particular those receiving capitation or incentive program payments per member. Premiums must also be collected promptly and accurately because such payments may have to be made in advance of the delivery of services to members. Network physicians unable to verify enrollment are unlikely to accept the plan's copayment amount from their patients, preferring instead to bill their usual charges for services.\n\nServicing the Case\n\n\tSimilarly, the importance of properly servicing a group insurance case cannot be overlooked. Good service not only increases the employer's satisfaction, but it also minimizes the possibility that the employer will transfer the case to another insurance company at the time of renewal. In addition, it may also lead to other business for the insurance company or the agent, broker, or consultant when the employer adds a new coverage or renews an existing coverage.\n\n\tThe process of servicing a case begins at the initial sale and continues throughout its life. The agent, broker, or consultant-often with the assistance of the group representative-usually conducts the servicing. However, some insurance companies have trained personnel whose sole function is to service group insurance cases, which allows the group representative to devote more of his or her time to sales activities. Most requests for service relate to routine administrative matters that involve billing, claims, or enrollment procedures. As previously mentioned, proper installation minimizes these requests. To discover whether there is any difficulty with a group insurance case at its earliest stage, the group representative must develop a close working relationship with other functional departments of the insurance company. For example, correspondence between the employer and claims personnel may be the first indication of any potential dissatisfaction.\n\n\tEven when no specific problems exist, the agent, broker, or consultant schedules periodic visits with the employer to discuss such items as the administration of the plan, claim trends, and new federal or state regulations that affect the plan. These visits may lead to suggestions that the employer make changes in the plan so that it better meets the employer's desires and needs.\n\n\tOne of the most important and possibly most difficult aspects of servicing a group insurance case occurs at the time of renewal, particularly if a rate increase is proposed (which is almost always the situation today for medical expense insurance). The shock of a large rate increase may be a catalyst that encourages an employer to seek out another insurance company. Therefore, it is important for the agent, broker, or consultant to keep the employer periodically informed of the group's experience and current trends so that the size of the increase is not unexpected. It is also at renewal time that the agent, broker, or consultant (often accompanied by the group representative) should thoroughly review the group insurance case to determine whether it is appropriate to make any changes. If the employer is considering changing insurance companies, the agent, broker, or consultant should emphasize any potential limitations of such an action. For example, the installation of a new plan will undoubtedly incur additional administrative costs. Furthermore, there may be the potential for some employees to lose benefits in the transfer because of differing provisions of the new insurance company's plan or the inability of an employee to immediately meet an actively-at-work requirement."

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Developing a Health Care Strategy\n\nDEVELOPING A HEALTH CARE STRATEGY\n\n\tDeveloping a health care strategy for providing employee health and medical care benefits can be viewed as a program for managing risk exposures on a variety of levels. In its most elementary form, managing this risk involves a three-pronged strategy. First, the organization sponsoring the plan must decide what mode of health care delivery system will be used. Second, the organization must decide on the benefits that will be provided through the selected system. Third, the plan sponsor must decide what contractual, financial, or payment arrangement will be negotiated with insurers or providers of medical care. Negotiation of the financial arrangement also includes what level of risk is assumed by the plan sponsor and whether certain types or levels of risk will be shifted to a third party such as an insurer or the providers of the medical care itself. Increasingly, plan sponsors shift some of this risk to ensure that medical providers have a stake in providing cost-effective and quality care. All three of these macro decisions involve many other tiers of decisions at the micro level, which can have a profound impact on the levels of risk assumed and the financial costs assumed by the plan sponsor. With the advent of health care reform, additional risks have been entered into the system, since plan sponsors may be subject to providing subsidies or vouchers (see subsequent discussion in this chapter) to some of their employees and/or will be subject to certain excise taxes.\n\nDesigning the Plan and Delivery System\n\n\tThe plan sponsor is not only selecting one of the delivery systems discussed previously, but also has latitude to select various plan designs offered by alternate delivery systems or to include plan-specific provisions or procedures particular to the employer group. Unless federal or state law requires certain benefits, an employer quite often has flexibility to design its own schedule of benefits, assuming it is of sufficient size to gain this degree of customization by an insurer or managed care company. At times, even state insurance law is not an immovable constraint, because certain administrative service financing arrangements exempt plans from state insurance mandates. Limitations on specific coverages, uses of deductibles or copayments, and the systems for case management and precertification can profoundly impact both risk exposure and cost. The delivery system and plan design, its oversight, and financial incentives also can have behavioral impacts on plan participants influencing the utilization of health care services.\n\n\tWith the passage of major health care reform legislation in 2010, a new era began in structuring health benefit programs. Additional regulation at the federal level immediately impacted plan design decisions. For example, this is evident in the previously described distinction between grandfathered and non grandfathered plans. PPACA also distinguished between large and small employer plans. The Act included a tax credit for small employers that purchased health insurance for their employees when the employer\n\n\t\u25a0 Has fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees\n\t\u25a0 Pays average annual wages under $50,000\n\t\u25a0 Contributes a uniform percentage of at least 50 percent of the total premium cost\n\n\tThe full credit is available to employers with ten or fewer full-time equivalent employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000, and begins phasing out over those amounts. (Beginning in 2014, the credit is available only for qualified health plan coverage purchased through a health exchange, and employers may only receive the credit for a maximum of two consecutive years.)\n\nVarious insurance market reforms mandated by PPACA placed constraints on plan sponsor design decisions. For instance, six months after enactment, group health plans and health insurers were not allowed to\n\n\t\u25a0 Impose lifetime or annual limits on essential benefits (subject to certain exceptions).\n\t\u25a0 Rescind coverage unless there was fraud or misrepresentation by the enrollee.\n\t\u25a0 Drop coverage for adult children on their parents' coverage, regardless of the adult child's student or marital status, until the adult child turns 26 years old.\n\t\u25a0 Impose preexisting condition exclusions on enrollees under age 19.\n\nSelf-Administration, Third-Party Administrators, and Unbundled Services\n\n\tThe decision to purchase an assembled delivery system from an insurer or managed care company or to directly contract with providers is generally dependent on employer size and the geographic concentrations of an organization's employees. When an employer is of sufficient size, it might want to deal directly with medical providers and eliminate the costs associated with the intermediary insurer. Even if an employer does not want to assume the burden of self-administration, it is not necessary to purchase all medical care management services through a single provider. An employer can decide to unbundle specific services that might be more effectively performed by separate entities or purchase an integrated set of services or programs through one provider. Moving specific, specialized functions to third-party vendors with special expertise in one area can sometimes address certain goals. At the very least, an employer should understand the costs of these services if they are left bundled with the insurer and review claims and other reports to evaluate the services' effectiveness and contributions to cost control.\n\n\tUnder PPACA, by 2014, certain employers' employees gain access to health insurance through health exchanges. PPACA requires each state to establish one or more health exchanges in which small employers and individuals can purchase health insurance. Initially, only small employers have access to purchase group health insurance through an exchange. However, by 2017, states may permit large employers to purchase group health coverage through their exchanges. States have the right to define \"small\" and \"large\" employers before 2016, though small employers generally will not exceed 100 employees. Lawful United States' residents (except incarcer\u00ad ated individuals) generally can access individual health coverage through an exchange in a state in which they live.\n\nUse of Multiple Plan Offerings and Single or Multiple Administrators\n\n\tMedical care delivery systems and benefit design are not an \"all-or\u00ad nothing\" decision for many large employers. Though some employers place their entire block of business with a single insurer or managed care company, many other employers have configured a variety of health plan alternatives and give employees the choice of selecting the health plan that best meets their individual needs. This can be accomplished through a simple choice of medical plan options or through a flexible benefit plan. In large part because of limited dollars available to expand benefit programs and a recognition that a diverse workforce may have varying benefit needs, flexible benefit programs proliferated in the 1980s. In a flex plan, employees are allocated a set amount generally in the form of credits or dollars from the employer, which they can \"spend\" to select the benefits and plan options of their choice or receive those credits in the form of cash if not spent on benefits. Nevertheless, many managed care companies and insurers offer employers an array of multiple plan designs. Price concessions are often offered if an employer agrees to place the entire block of business with a single administrative entity. An employer must balance the price concessions it will receive and assess the effectiveness of the administrative entity at managing health care costs against the loss of competition that occurs when multiple plan offerings through various administrators are eliminated.\n\nPricing Plan Options and Designing Employer Subsidies\n\n\tRegardless of whether multiple administrators or a single administrator are used for separate plan offerings, the plan sponsor must look at the pricing of plan options and make decisions regarding the form and amount of employer subsidy provided to employees. An employer offering a flexible benefit program may price various plan options at prevailing market rates, assign all employees an equal credit amount, and allow them to spend the credits as they prefer. Other employers provide a direct subsidy to their medical plans and only show employees the remaining employee costs they will be required to pay. Some employers subsidize family contracts to a greater extent than single coverage. The employer must also decide how to relate the subsidy to each medical plan option. Plan pricing will affect employee selection patterns. Premiums are impacted by the level of deductibles and co-payments that have been included in the front-end plan design. Accordingly, an employer can determine whether plan costs and certain benefits are being borne by those utilizing those particular benefits or are being spread over the employee group at large.\n\nMore transparency and analysis on pricing plan options emerged in the wake of PPACA's passage. The Act imposed penalties, effective 2014, on employers with an average of 50 or more employees who\n\n\t\u25a0 Offer inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage or do not offer minimum essential coverage; or\n\t\u25a0 Have at least one full-time employee who qualifies for federal premium assistance for coverage through an exchange\n\nThe penalty varies depending on whether the employer fails to offer minimum essential coverage or offers inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage. Effective 2018, employers who provide health benefits deemed to be too generous will also be assessed penalties. An employer sponsoring a so-called \"Cadillac\" group health plan is required to pay a 40 percent excise tax on the excess value of the coverage.\n\nThe Effects of Multiple Plan Offerings on Employee Selection Patterns and Pricing\n\n\tThe offering of multiple benefit offerings can create an exodus of favorable risks from existing offerings and result in price escalations for those who choose to stay with a previously offered plan. In some cases, the offering of a new plan at favorable pricing can cause such dramatic migration out of a plan that the remaining plan will experience a price spiral that causes termination of the plan. This was particularly true in the mid-1980s for many employers who offered traditional indemnity plans. The offering of either a less expensive comprehensive plan or an HMO resulted in those employees with low utilization for major services migrating to the less costly plans, seeking to reduce their expenditures on monthly health care premiums. With this loss of favorable risks, the indemnity plan retained less favorable risks with higher utilization patterns. Because there was a smaller pool of favorable risks in the plan over which to spread plan costs, the premiums charged to those who remained increased. This increase in plan costs resulted in another wave of more favorable risks choosing to leave the plan rather than bear the increased costs of the plan. Again costs increased, giving further incentive for favorable risks to migrate from the plan. Ultimately, a cost spiral like this will cause a plan to become prohibitively expensive and result in its demise.\n\n\tAs the provisions of PPACA are phased in, employers will need to be vigilant regarding the effects that alternative access to coverage through health exchanges have on their employee selection patterns and pricing. Effective 2014, employers that pay for any portion of health coverage and offer minimum essential coverage are required to supply \"free choice vouchers\" to qualified employees to purchase qualified health coverage through an exchange. A qualified employee eligible for free choice vouch\u00ad ers has the following characteristics:\n\n\t\u25a0 His or her required contribution for minimum essential coverage through the employer's plan exceed 8 percent but is less than 9.8 percent of the employee's annual household income.\n\t\u25a0 His or her household income does not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\t\u25a0 He or she does not participate in an employer-sponsored health plan.\n\n\tThe value of the free choice voucher is the most generous amount that the employer would have contributed under the firm's plan for self-only coverage or, if relevant, family coverage. Employers are required to pay this sum to an exchange. Subsequently, the exchange credits the amount towards the monthly premium for the plan selected by the employee. When the free choice voucher amount exceeds the exchange plan premium, the difference is refunded to the employee and is subject to taxation. Employers may deduct the amount paid in vouchers and are not assessed the employer mandate penalty for employees receiving vouchers.\n\nDesigning the Underwriting and Financial Arrangements\n\n\tAs indicated in the discussion of alternative financing techniques, an employer can dramatically alter the financial arrangement of its medical benefits program by determining the amount of risk it will accept. The strategic issue is to select a financial arrangement that controls costs and allows management to assume the level of risk that it believes appropriate for its employee group. The financial arrangement selected can have a behavioral impact on both the providers managing care and the insurer or administrator responsible for management of the plan. Increasingly, employers have explored arrangements that shift more risk to health care providers and that promote incentives to provide quality care. Much research, is being done on measuring quality of care and developing information systems that can be used to evaluate cost and quality of care.\n\n\tThe financial strategy for a medical benefits program will have multiple tiers. This is particularly true if multiple plan options are available and employees choose between plan offerings. Plan pricing and plan offerings can alter enrollment patterns and affect the effectiveness of a given financial arrangement or risk-management strategy.\n\n\tDetermining cost-effective medical providers and health plans is not an easy exercise. Certain plans will attract employees from certain demographic and geographic constituencies because of plan benefits or the convenience of provider locations. Health care costs are directly correlated with age, in that older individuals tend to need more care and need to access more extensive and thus more expensive care. Likewise, there can be regional differences in the cost of medical care. Sometimes, base premium costs or allocated costs per participant are not the best indicator of cost-effective medical care. Analyzing plan costs by adjusting for demographic, geographic, and other variables in the plan population is the best way to evaluate the cost efficiency.\n\nMeasuring Performance and Managing the Plan\n\n\tA final attribute of health care strategy is to create a system of monitoring and measuring the attainment of plan objectives. It is also important to have a system of controls that ensures that the plan is being effectively managed. A well-developed plan design is of little use if a third-party administrator is unable to administer the design as it was intended. A system for auditing plan results, ensuring quality outcomes, and reporting utilization is necessary. For this reason, any delegation of responsibilities for health plan management should involve negotiation on the management reporting responsibilities of the administrator and the performance standards it is expected to achieve. Assigning financial penalties or providing rewards associated with these performance standards can be very effective. For instance, with a traditional insured product, a plan sponsor can require claims payment within a certain number of days for a percent of the claims. With a managed care provider operating a staff model HMO, reporting could be required on the telephone systems for contacting PCPs. There could be performance criteria on the amount of time it takes to reach a physician by phone, and scheduling standards for the amount of time between the initial call and an available appointment.\n"

With all the complexity and regulations associated with employee benefit plans, employers should consult with an attorney or a benefits specialist to make sure that everything is set up properly.\n\u2022 Failing to include certain employees in the plan. The general rule is if one employee gets a tax-advantaged benefit (one paid for with pre-tax dollars) the same benefit has to be made available to all employees.\n\u2022 Providing benefits that aren't really needed. For instance, if most of the employees are young and healthy, there may not be any reason to offer life insurance.\n\u2022 Including family or friends in the health care plan. If there's a large claim by a non-employee and the insurer investigates the claim, the result could be disallowance of the claim or even cancellation of the policy.\n\u2022 Not enrolling new employees in plans during the open enrollment period. Most plans have a fixed time period for open enrollment and attempting to enroll a new employee later on requires proof of insurability, which can lead to problems for both the employee and the employer.\n\u2022 Failing to let employees know how much their benefits cost the employer. Benefit plans are expensive and employees will appreciate them more if they're made aware of exactly how costly those benefits are for the employer.\n\u2022 Absorbing all or most of the expense of the benefit plan themselves. Get the employees to share some of the expense. For example, roughly 90% of employers now require employee contributions to the employer's health care plan.\n\u2022 Doing a poor job of communicating with their employees about the plan. It can be a fine line, providing too much detail about plan options or not providing enough, but employees need to have a clear understanding of their options so they can make informed choices.\n\u2022 Accidentally misrepresenting the benefits offered when hiring a new employee. An employee can sue for the benefits promised during the hiring phase, even if those benefits don't agree with what is in the actual benefit plan documents.\n\u2022 Not having employees who choose not to participate in a benefit plan sign a waiver to that effect. If there's no document to the contrary, employees can sue, claiming that they were never offered the opportunity to participate in the plan.\n\u2022 Failing to notify the insurance company about changes in employee pay rates.\n\u2022 Failing to keep up with changes in benefit plan regulations. Employers need to make use of a lawyer, benefits consultant, or a service of some kind to keep them up to date on regulatory changes.\n\u2022 Failing to deposit employee retirement contributions into the plan's trust fund in a timely manner. The hard deadline to deposit these contributions is the fifteenth business day of the month after the contribution was deducted from the employee's pay.\n\u2022 Failing to notify participants of changes in the benefit plan. Employers are required to notify participants in a health care or retirement plan of any changes in that plan and make them aware of how those changes affect them.\n\u2022 Allowing employees to stay on health plan coverage too long. For instance, keeping an employee who's on FMLA leave on the health plan after coverage should have been terminated. Note: in that particular case the employer should terminate health coverage and offer the employee COBRA coverage instead.\n\u2022 Putting independent contractors on the company's health care plan. Adding contractors creates a multi-employer plan, which carries additional restrictions and reporting requirements (such as annual filing of an M-1 report).\n\u2022 Failing to properly backup and secure plan participant's personal data. In particular, employers who make use of benefit management software should make sure that it includes strong cybersecurity features.\n"

This premium covers all health care costs that the plan will pay during the year based on the design of the plan.\n    If actual costs are lower than premiums. If costs are lower than the amount of the premiums, the insurance company either keeps the difference, returns some of it in the form of a dividend, or credits it against the following year's cost estimates.\n    If actual costs are higher than premiums. If actual costs are higher than the annual premiums, the insurance company is at risk and pays the difference.

An employer is protected from the financial impact of catastrophic claims that exceed the budgeted premium amount.\n    This method also allows employers to budget their costs because the number of employees determines the monthly plan cost.\n    The insurance company is the claims payer and is responsible for adjudication of claims and the management of claims appeals.\n\nDisadvantages to employers\n    By using this method, however, an employer gives up any flexibility in funding benefits and has lost the use of the money (and any investment earnings on it).\n    This method also requires the payment of extra margin cost that represents the insurer's profit and marketing costs, as well as state premium taxes.\n    An employer who offers a fully insured plan may have difficulty in modifying any benefit provisions that are mandated by state insurance laws- see KB-1 Topic 640-670.\n"

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - What is a Health Savings Account (HSA) and how does it work?\n\n\tHealth savings accounts are an alternative to standard group insurance plans. A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -  Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - Health Savings Accounts\n\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs)\n\n\tIn addition to providing prescription drug coverage for older Americans, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs are designed as successors to Archer MSAs, which are briefly discussed later, and the two have many features in common. However, they also have some notable differences that make HSAs more attractive than Archer MSAs and available to a much larger pool of consumers.\n\n\tHSAs were allowed as early as 2004. Various surveys indicate that by 2009 there were 6 to 7 million people with high-deductible health plans that met the criteria for them to also have HSAs. About three-quarters of these people have such health plans through employer-provided medical expense arrangements, but only about half of this group have either established HSAs or had their employers establish HSAs for them.\n\nGeneral Nature\n\n\tAn HSA is a personal savings account from which unreimbursed medical expenses, including deductibles, percentage participation, and copayments, can be paid. The HSA must be in the form of a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established in conjunction with a high-deductible health (medical expense) plan. An HSA is established with a qualified trustee or custodian in much the same way that an IRA is established. Any insurance company or bank (as well as certain other financial institutions) can be a trustee or custodian, as can any other person or entity already approved by the IRS as a trustee or custodian for IRAs.\n\n\tHSAs are individual trusts, which prohibits a husband and wife from having a joint HSA. But as long as both are eligible, each may have a separate HSA.\n\n\tSome insurers that sell high-deductible health plans for use with HSAs also market the HSA accounts; other insurers leave it to the purchasers of a high-deductible health plan to establish their HSAs with other institutions.\n\n\tEven though employers can sponsor HSAs, these accounts are established for the benefit of individuals and are portable. If an employee changes employers or leaves the workforce, the HSA, including the balance in the account, remains with the individual.\n\nEligibility\n\n\tEmployees, the self-employed, and anyone else can establish HSAs as long as they meet the following rules for qualification:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual must be covered by a high-deductible health plan. That plan may be insured or self-insured if offered by an employer as long as it meets the criteria for a qualifying high-deductible plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual is not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person's federal income tax return.\n\n\t\t\u2022 With some exceptions, a person who is covered under a high-deductible health plan is denied eligibility for an HSA if he or she is covered under another health plan that does not meet the definition of a high-deductible plan but that provides any benefits that are covered under the high-deductible health plan. The exceptions include coverage for accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care as well as liability insurance, insurance for a specified disease or illness, and insurance paying a fixed amount per period of hospitalization. Participation in a typical FSA would make an individual ineligible to participate in an HSA unless the FSA only provided reimbursement for types of expenses not covered under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\n\tAn employer can establish HSAs for its employees, or an individual (whether employed or not) may establish his or her own HSA.\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plan\n\n\tFor purposes of HSA participation, a high-deductible health plan is defined as having the following deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limitations for covered services. These figures are for 2012 and subject to annual inflation adjustments:\n\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of self-only coverage, the deductible must be at least $1,200, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $6,050.\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $12,100.\n\n\tIf these high-deductible plans use preferred-provider networks, they can have higher out-of-pocket limits for services provided outside the network, and any deductibles for nonnetwork services are not taken into account when determining the out-of-pocket limits specified above.\n\n\tOne point should be emphasized about the deductible for family coverage. It is not a family deductible as was described in the discussion on major medical insurance. In that situation, there is an individual deductible that\napplies to each family member as well as a separate deductible for the family. This is sometimes referred to as an embedded deductible, and the policy pays benefits for any family member once his or her deductible is satisfied, even if the family deductible is not yet met.\n\n\tIn the case of a high-deductible policy used with an HSA, there will usually not be an individual deductible if a policy is written for a family. Rather, there will be a single deductible-referred to as a common deductible-that must be satisfied before any benefits are payable, even if all claims are for one family member. It is permissible, however, to use an embedded deductible, but only if the individual deductible is equal to at least the required HSA family deductible of $2,400.\n\n\tThe following incurred expenses do not count toward the plan's required deductible and out-of-pocket limit:\n\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services not covered by the high-deductible health plan\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services received from nonnetwork health care providers, if the plan uses a preferred-provider network\n\t\t\u2022 amounts above a plan's reasonable allowable specific service maximums\n\t\t\u2022 amounts in excess of reasonable and customary fees \n\t\t\u2022 penalties for failure to obtain a plan-required certification\n\n\tNevertheless, copayments and required percentage participation count toward the out-of-pocket limit, even if the plan does not consider them as contributing toward the satisfaction of the deductible. In addition, the deductible amount counts towards the out-of-pocket limit. However, employee contributions paid for the coverage do not count.\n\nPreventive Care\n\n\tGenerally, a high-deductible health plan established in conjunction with an HSA cannot provide benefits before the deductible is satisfied, but there is an exception for benefits for preventive care. A high-deductible health plan may provide benefits for the following preventive care services before the insured satisfies the plan's required high deductible:\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual physicals, immunizations, and screening services\n\n\t\t\u2022 routine prenatal and well-child care\n\n\t\t\u2022 tobacco cessation programs and obesity weight-loss programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 employee-assistance, disease management, or wellness programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 treatment of a related condition that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive care service or screening, such as removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy\n\n\t\t\u2022 drugs or medications taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease before the disease manifests itself or to prevent the reoccurrence of a disease from which the person has recovered. An example is the drug treatment of high cholesterol to prevent heart disease, or the treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with medications to prevent a recurrence. Other prescription drugs that do not qualify under this exception remain subject to the plan's high deductible.\n\nPreventive care must be offered with no cost-sharing.\n\nContributions\n\n\tContributions to an HSA may be made solely by individuals who have such accounts. They may also be made by employers that provide their employees with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIndividual Contributions\n\n\tIndividuals often fund HSAs without employer contributions because they are not employees or because their employer makes no contribution to HSAs. Contributions must be in the form of cash, and they are deductible for federal income tax purposes even if the individual does not itemize deductions.\n\n\tThe maximum annual contribution to an HSA in 2012 is $3,100 if the account holder has self-only coverage and $6,250 if the account holder has family coverage. These amounts are subject to annual indexing for inflation. As a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the full maximum contribution is allowed even if it exceeds the policy deductible amount under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\tIf both a husband and wife establish an HSA and have family coverage (that is, a single policy covering both of them), they can allocate the maximum contribution in any way they determine. If they have separate policies, each is subject to the limits that apply to self-only coverage.\n\n\tIndividuals aged 55 or older are also permitted an additional annual catch-up contribution of up to $1,000. If both a husband and wife are aged 55 or older, the catch-up contribution is available to each of them only if they have separate HSAs.\n\n\tAnnual contributions can be made in a lump sum or spread out over time. However, the contributions for a specific tax year cannot be made before the tax year begins or after the taxpayer's original filing date (without extensions) for that tax year. For most individuals, this is the earlier of April 15 of the following year or the date a return is filed. This is similar to the rules for IRA contributions.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJack and Eva, a married couple, retired last year when they each reached age 56. They purchased a family medical expense policy with a $5,000 deductible, and Jack established an HSA. The maximum contribution to the HSA for 2012 is $7,250, which consists of the regular $6,250 limit and an additional catch-up amount of $1,000 for Jack.\n\n\tHowever, i\u00a3 they each established an HSA, they both would be eligible to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution to their own accounts. The$6,250 regular contribution could be allocated between the two accounts as they agree upon. The net effect is that the total HSA contributions would increase to $8,250.\n\n\tThey can make these contributions in one or more payments between January 1, 2012 and the date they file their 2012 tax return.\n\n\tIf an individual stops participating in an HSA during a tax year, the actual HSA contribution that can be deducted for the tax year is limited to 1/12 of the annual amount, as described previously, times the number of months that an individual is eligible for HSA participation. Until 2007, the same rule applied if an individual began participating in an HSA after January of the tax-year-only a proportionate contribution could be made. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act changed the rule as long as an individual is still eligible to participate in an HSA during the last month of a tax-year. In such a situation, the individual is allowed to make the full annual tax-deductible contribution for the year. However, if he or she fails to remain eligible for an HSA for at least 12 months thereafter (other than because of death or disability), the contribution for the prior year that is attributable to months when the account holder did not have an HSA is includible in gross income and subject to a 20 percent penalty tax.\n\n\tAn excess contribution occurs to the extent that contributions to an HSA exceed the tax-deductible limits or are made for an ineligible person. The account holder is subject to a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions (including those made by an employer) for each year these contributions are in an account. This excise tax can be avoided if the excess amount and any net income attributable to the excess amount are removed from the HSA prior to the last day prescribed by law, (including extensions) for filing the account holder's income tax return. The net income attributable to the excess contributions is included in the account holder's gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is made.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\tPaul, aged 55, is eligible for an HSA and has a self-only high-deductible policy. In January 2012, he made a contribution of $2,000 to the HSA. On July 1, Paul decided to cease being a self-employed freelance editor and become an employee of a magazine. He cancelled his previous medical expense policy and enrolled in his new employer's, which did not qualify as a high-deductible health plan. As a result, Paul's allowable HSA contribution for the year is only 6/12 of $3,000, or $1,500. He is now in the position of having made an excess contribution for the year. As long as he withdraws the other $500 plus any earnings on this amount before filing his 2012 tax return, he will avoid any adverse tax consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\tJane, aged 39, did just the opposite of Paul. She left her prior job with an employer and became a self-employed consultant. This occurred on November 1, 2012, when she dropped her former HMO coverage through the employer and purchased a high-deductible medical expense policy for herself and her son. She also established an HSA. She is eligible to make the full 2012 contribution of $6,250 and took it as a deduction on her 2012 tax return. However, if she does not continue to be covered under a high-deductible health plan through 2013, a portion of this amount will have to be included as taxable income for 2013.\n\nRoll-Over Contributions\n\n\tAn account balance from an Archer MSA can be rolled over to an HSA on a tax-free basis. Similarly, account balances from an existing HSA can be rolled over to a new HSA.\n\n\tThe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also allows certain other types of tax-free rollovers in specific circumstances. For example, an account holder who establishes an HSA is allowed a one-time rollover of funds from an HRA or health FSA. The amount of the rollover, which is in addition to any regular contribution for the year, is limited to the lesser of the balance in such an account on (1) September 21, 2006, or (2) the date of the rollover. If the account holder does not remain eligible to participate in an HSA for at least one year after the rollover, the amount of the rollover is included in income for tax purposes and subject to a penalty tax. Finally, an account holder may make a one-time-only rollover from an IRA. The amount of the rollover is limited to the tax-deductible HSA contribution for the year and reduces any regular contribution allowed.\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\n\tMany persons with HDHPs have their coverage under an employer-provided plan, and their employer may make contributions to the HSAs of employees. Employer contributions belong to the employee and are nonforfeitable. The employer might make the maximum annual contribution as previously described. However, it is also possible that the employer contribution will contribute a lower amount. In this case, an employee can make any remaining allowable contribution.\n\n\tAn employer that contributes to HSAs is subject to a nondiscrimination rule that requires the employer to make comparable contributions for all employees who have HSAs. Failure to comply with this rule subjects the employer to an excise tax. However, full-time employees and part-time employees (those working fewer than 30 hours per week) are treated separately. The comparability rule generally requires that the employer contribute either the same dollar amount for each employee or the same percentage of each employee's deductible under the health plan. However, it is permissible for an employer to make larger contributions for nonhighly-compensated employees than for highly compensated employees.\n\nHSA Account Growth\n\n\tUnused amounts in an HSA accumulate on a tax-free basis and carry over to subsequent years without limit. The size of an HSA balance carried over from prior years has no effect on a current year's contribution.\n\nDistributions from an HSA\n\n\tAn individual can usually take distributions from an HSA at any time, but the trust or custodial document may put reasonable restrictions on both the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. Generally, accounts are set up so that they can be accessed with debit cards or checks written by the account holder as an alternative to actually filing for reimbursement. The amount of the distribution can be any part or all of the account balance. Subject to some exceptions, distributions of both contributions and earnings are excludible from an account holder's gross income if used to pay medical expenses of the account holder and the account holder's legal spouse and tax dependents as long as these expenses are not paid by other sources of insurance. There is no requirement that these family members be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. If both a husband and wife have HSAs, the reimbursement for any family can come from either or both HSAs but together cannot exceed the amount of the unreimbursed expense.\n\n\tFor the most part, the eligible medical expenses are the same ones that would be deductible, ignoring the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation (10 percent in 2013), if the account holder itemized his or her income tax deductions. Tax-free withdrawals are permitted for the purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for the purchase of health coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation. They are also permitted for the purchase of long-term care insurance up to certain deductible limits. However, tax-free withdrawals are not otherwise permitted for the purchase of health insurance by persons under age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tEric has accumulated $6,000 in his HSA account during the last 3 years. Because hjs wife has medical expense coverage with her employer, Eric's high-deductible policy is for him only.\n\n\tIn February, Eric incurred his first medical expenses for the year when he severely sprained his wrist. He incurred $1,000 in medical expenses that were not covered under his policy because the $5,000 deductible had not been met. Eric can pay for these expenses with funds from his HSA.\n\n\tIn April, Eric had a routine eye examination that cost $120. This examination was not covered under his medical expense policy, but it qualifies as a medical expense for IRS purposes. Therefore, Eric can take a $120 tax-free distribution from his HSA.\n\n\tIn July, Eric's wife had a crown installed by her dentist. Her employer-provided health insurance paid only $600 of the dentist's bill. Eric can use his HSA to pay the remaining $400 because HSA funds can be used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses of an account holder's legal spouse. (Note that the IRS considers medical expenses to include charges for dental services.)\n\n\n\tEven though contributions cannot be made after an individual reaches age 65 and becomes a Medicare beneficiary, tax-free distributions can still be used for any future qualified medical expenses, which include premiums for original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage plans, and medical expense coverage under employer-sponsored plans. However, an account holder cannot use tax-free distributions to pay premiums for a Medicare supplement policy.\n\n\tFrom a financial planning standpoint, account holders may want to wait until after retirement or age 65 to take HSA distributions as long as they have the resources to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses prior to that time. This will allow their HSA balances to grow on a tax-favored basis for use in their older years when unreimbursed medical expenses may be higher and/or income may be lower.\n\n\tDistributions are permitted for other reasons, but they are subject to income taxation and possibly to a 20 percent penalty tax. However, the penalty tax does not apply in the case of distributions after an individual's death, disability, or the attainment of age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKirby has a balance of $7,000 in his HSA. At age 67, he rediscovered his childhood sweetheart and fell madly in love. She agreed to marry him and he wants to give her a big diamond ring. Because she told Kirby that she would take care of him for life, he decided to cash in his HSA and apply the proceeds to purchase the ring. His tax accountant informed Kirby that this arrangement would not be a qualified medical expense. He can withdraw the funds without penalty because he is at least age 65, but the $7,000 must be included in his gross income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\n\tFormer employees, including retirees, may continue HSAs that were established prior to termination of employment, and the rules for contributions and distributions are as previously described.\n\n\tRetirees who did not have an HSA prior to retirement can establish one at that time as long as all the proper rules are satisfied. Such an HSA may present an opportunity for a retiree to reduce income taxes. However, the requirement of having a high-deductible plan will probably negate this advantage if an individual has substantial medical expenses.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKathleen, a widow, retired at age 60 from her job as an attorney. She likes the concept of consumer-directed health plans and has decided to establish an HSA. In order to be eligible for the HSA, she purchased a major medical policy with an annual deductible of $2,500. She plans to make the maximum allowable contribution to the HSA until she is eligible for Medicare. She will then use her HSA balance to pay her Medicare premiums.\n\n\tThere are fees involved in establishing an HSA. These fees may affect any potential tax advantages if an HSA is established near the time of Medicare enrollment.\n\nEstate Tax Treatment of HSAs\n\n\tUpon death, the remaining balance in an HSA is includible in the account holder's gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the account is a surviving spouse, the HSA belongs to the spouse and he or she can deduct the account balance in determining the account holder's taxable estate. The surviving spouse can then use the HSA for his or her medical expenses. If the beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, the HSA ceases to exist, and the beneficiary must include the fair market value of the account in his or her gross income for tax purposes. If no beneficiary is named, the tax is payable by the estate or the beneficiary of the estate.\n\nEstablishing and Maintaining HSAs\n\n\tThere are a number of issues that need to be evaluated by an individual who has the option to establish an HSA. Perhaps the most important question is whether such an account is appropriate. After a person decides to establish an HSA, issues such as account fees, investment options for funds, and record keeping must be addressed.\n\nAppropriateness of HSAs\n\n\tFor some persons, an HSA is very appropriate and offers significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities. For other persons, an HSA may not be an attractive financial commitment. An HSA's viability depends on individual circumstances such as income, tax rates, the funds available to fund such an account, when account balance will be withdrawn, earnings on account funds, and account fees. Some of these issues are addressed in the following example.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJohn and his wife, both aged 50, no longer have any dependent children. They are self-employed and have a joint income of $150,000. For the last few years, they have had an HSA-compatible policy with a $5,000 deductible, but have not established HSAs. They are in good health and have paid aU unreimbursed medical expenses from current income. Their financial advisor has suggested that one or both of them should establish an HSA. They have decided to do so, and make an annual contribution of $5,000, which is an affordable financial commitment. This will result in an annual income tax savings of $1,300 (based on IRS estimates). They have also decided to continue paying any unreimbursed medical expenses from current income and to let the HSA funds accumulate until they retire at age 65. They plan on investing the funds and expect them to grow at about 5 percent per year. If this return is achieved, they will have a fund of about $100,000 when they retire. They will then withdraw amounts as needed on a tax-free basis to pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nAccount Fees\n\n\tOne factor that varies widely among financial institutions that offer HSAs is the fees that they charge. If an individual uses an HSA that has been established by his or her employer, the employer may pay some of these fees. But no matter how an account is established, a potential account holder should look at the fees and their impact on the account balance. Unfortunately, this is not always easy to do. Although financial institutions often have information about their HSAs on Web sites or in print, the fee structure is often conspicuously absent or hard to locate. Unlike other types of financial products, such as IRAs, there are no requirements to provide potential account holders with\na prospectus that details the fees. Therefore, it is often necessary to ask specific questions. As the next example demonstrates, these fees may have an effect on the decision to establish an HSA. Even if an HSA is an obvious choice, the account balance will be affected by the fee structure.\n\n\tHSA fees fall into several categories that might include one or more of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 account setup fee. This is a one-time fee to establish the HSA. Such fees typically range from $0 to $50, with $15 or $20 being common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual fee. An HSA may have an annual fee that ranges up to $200, but amounts of $10 to $20 are most common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 monthly maintenance fee. An HSA may have a monthly maintenance fee that ranges up to $10, but amounts like $2 to $3 seem most common. Although there may be both a monthly maintenance fee and an annual fee, this is very uncommon; there is usually one or the other. In either case, the amount of the fee may be lower for higher account balances.\n\n\t\t\u2022 transaction fee. An HSA may have a fee that is levied on each transaction. The fee may apply to contributions, but is most likely to be levied on withdrawals only. Fees may be as high as $5, but $.25 to $.50 are quite common. Sometimes a few transactions are allowed without a fee, but fees are levied on transactions in excess of this number.\n\n\t\t\u2022 account closing fee. It is not unusual for an HSA to have an account closing fee that can range up to $25 or $30, although $10 is a more common amount.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tAmber is an administrative assistant who earns about $40,000 annually. She has an employer-provided medical expense policy with a $2,500 deductible. Her employer has not set up HSAs for employees and makes no HSA contributions. Amber enjoys traveling and what money she has left is being saved for a new car that she hopes to buy within the next 2 years. Amber is healthy and incurs about $500 in unreimbursed medical expenses annually. This typically includes two doctor's visits and quarterly refills of a prescription drug. To minimize her taxes, Amber decides toestablish an HSA. She plans on putting the $500 into an HSA account and taking a withdrawal each time she incurs an unreimbursed medical expense. This will lower her taxes by about $75. When she looks into establishing such an account with her local bank, she finds that they have an account setup fee of $15. There is also a $2 monthly maintenance fee ($24 per year) and a $3 fee for each withdrawal ($18 for her six transactions). Therefore, she will incur expenses of $57 to save $75 the first year. When Amber finds out that her account balance will be too small to earn more than 1 percent interest, she decides that an HSA is not worth the administrative hassle for such a minimal tax savings.\n\nInvestment Options for HSA Funds\n\n\tFinancial institutions often offer several types of investment options for HSA funds. Account holders can invest HSA funds in essentially the same manner as IRA funds. Allowable investments include bank accounts, annuities, certificates of deposit, stocks, mutual funds, and bonds. Investments in life insurance policies or most types of collectibles are prohibited. In addition, an HSA trust or custodial agreement may limit the investment options available.\n\n\tAlthough mutual funds and stocks may result in the best return over a number of years, they are probably unsuitable if an account holder has modest amounts in an HSA that will be used for medical expenses in the near future. Like many types of investments, they will fluctuate in value over time. Such investments may also be unavailable unless an account holder has an account balance of several thousand dollars. The prior example regarding John under the heading Appropriateness shows when such an investment makes sense.\n\n\tIn most cases, an individual will be using some type of bank account that allows easy access to the available funds. In this case, it is important to evaluate the return that these funds will earn, which is set by each bank. In some cases, nothing is paid unless the account exceeds a minimum balance, such as $1,000. Interest rates may also vary by the size of the account's average daily balance. In still other cases, a specified interest rate, which can change, is paid on any size balance. Even with these variations, there are significant differences among banks.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\tCustodians and trustees for HSAs report the amount of annual contributions to and distributions from each HSA to the IRS. Under IRS rules, it is the account holder's responsibility to determine whether distributions from HSAs are for eligible medical expenses. Therefore, individuals who establish such accounts should maintain records in case they are audited. They should also become familiar with the types of expenses that are deductible. Guidance can be found in IRS Publication 502, which is available on the IRS Web site: irs.gov."

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 7 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Consumer-Driven Health Plans - Individually Controlled Health Accounts\n           A key element of consumer-driven health care includes a \"personal account\" under the control of the individual. This account can be used for health care expenses, including copayments, deductibles, health care items, or services not covered by the plan. These accounts can be structured in several ways and go by various names. However, to take full advantage of favorable tax treatment, most of these accounts will fall under one of three legally recognized accounts:\n\u25a0 Health flexible spending accounts or arrangements (FSAs)\n\u25a0 HRAs\n\u25a0 HSAs\n\n           Each of these accounts provides tax-advantaged reimbursement for qualified medical expenses as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) prohibits reimbursement for over-the-counter drugs, unless the drug is a prescribed drug or is insulin, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010. Each also provides some degree of employee control over health care spending decisions. Yet, each has distinctive benefits, features, and restrictions. While more than one type of account may be desirable to optimize benefits and tax advantages, there are rules governing the use of multiple accounts. (Reference 5 below)\n           As defined earlier, a CDHP involves an HDHP coupled with either an HRA or an HSA. However, an employee may be eligible for, and enrolled in, more than one type of account. The rules provide:\n\u25a0 An employee covered by a HDHP and either a health FSA or an HRA generally cannot make contributions, or have employer contributions made on their behalf, to an HSA. However, an employee can make contributions to an HSA while covered under an HDHP and a \"limited purpose\" FSA. Limited purpose FSAs cover expenses not otherwise covered by the plan, such as dental or vision care.\n\u25a0 An HRA participant may also have a general purpose FSA, although both accounts cannot be used for the same claim. The employer establishes the priority, which is outlined in the plan document.\n\nCafeteria Plan Health FSAs\n            Health FSAs have been popular since the 1980s and usually operate as part of a \"cafeteria plan,\" as defined under the federal tax code, and so named because these plans allow an employer to offer employees a selection of various benefits. Health FSAs are funded on a pretax basis, usually through salary reduction. Amounts contributed to FSAs are not subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or Federal Unemployment-Tax Act (FUTA) taxes, adding another level of savings for the employer and the employee. The employee, however, may be ambivalent about the impact the FICA exemption has on future Social Security benefits. The big draw\u00adback with FSAs is the \"use-it-or-lose-it\" rule. Health FSAs do not allow unused balances to carry over from year to year. However, plans may per\u00ad mit a grace period of up to two and one-half months after the end of the plan year for remaining balances to be utilized.6 The plan is not permitted to refund any unused balances left in the account. This \"use-it-or-lose-it\" feature of FSAs has long been recognized-and criticized-as punishing the \"thrifty\" employee and encouraging unnecessary health care spending.\n\nHealth Reimbursement Arrangements\n            A few employers began offering HRAs in 2001. By early 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Treasury, were besieged with insurance companies seeking guidance on the tax treatment of a high-deductible health insurance product that would be coupled with an annually funded health care account in which the unused balances could be carried over from year to year. These plans and accounts met with a sympathetic view. And as health care costs began to escalate again after a few years of relatively modest growth, the accounts seemed to make sense.\n\n             The IRS ruled that HRAs paid for solely by the employer and permiting unused amounts to be carried over from year to year would qualify as health benefits exempt from federal income taxes and employment taxes. But the IRS specifically prohibits the use of employee contributions. Contributions cannot be funded through employee salary deferrals under a cafeteria plan. HRAs are notional accounts, meaning they normally are not funded. Claims are paid as incurred, providing an attractive cash flow advantage to the employer.\n\n             HRAs can be used to pay for unreimbursed qualified medical expenses, as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, an employer may limit what expenses are eligible under the HRA. For example, an employer could restrict HRA reimbursements to include only those expenses eligible under the employer's medical plan. Alternatively, the employer could elect to allow HRA use for services not normally covered by the plan, such as dental and vision. The employer may also permit payment of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) or retiree health care plan premiums from balances remaining at termination or retirement.\n\n              HRAs offered proponents of consumer-driven health care plans an opportunity to move forward. Yet these accounts had the considerable disadvantage of allowing only claim payments from employer dollars and did not provide any tax advantages to prefund health care expenses. Employees who needed more tax-favored money to pay out-of-pocket expenses could not supplement the employer account with pretax dollars.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts\n              Consumer-driven health care proponents were finally able to convince Congress that an account funded by employers or employees or both on essentially a tax-free basis could truly provide a boost to consumer-driven health care and increase participants' active involvement, because the participant would see the account as \"my money,\" not the employer's. In 2003, as part of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), Congress adopted HSAs, and the first plans became available in 2004. The IRS moved quickly to provide additional guidance on their usage.\n\n              Health savings accounts are largely an extension of Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) that were first passed by Congress in 1997. MSAs could be offered only to small employers (fewer than 50 employees) and permitted balances to be carried forward from year to year if coupled with a high-deductible health insurance policy. No other health coverage could be offered by the employer. These accounts were not allowed to be established after 2007 and have essentially been replaced by HSAs.\n\n              When compared with an HRA or a traditional health care flexible spending account offered under a cafeteria plan, HSAs offer much more flexibility in funding and encourage participant savings for future medical expenses. An HSA provides triple tax savings: tax deductible contributions, tax-free interest on investment earnings, and tax-free distributions for qualified medical expenses.\n\n              HSA accounts are fully owned by the employee and have the advantage of portability. The employee has unfettered access to the funds, even for nonmedical purposes. However, distributions for reasons other than qualified medical expenses are subject to income tax as well as an additional 20 percent tax penalty. (Reference 7 below) Claim substantiation requirements differ for HSAs compared to HRAs and FSAs. Under HRAs and FSAs, medical expenses must be substantiated to the HRA or FSA administrator for reim\u00ad bursement. HSA reimbursements may be made without submitting proof that the costs were incurred, but substantiation is required in case of audit. \n\n             Immediate employee ownership and access to funds for nonmedical purposes, while very attractive to employees, may make some employers reluctant to contribute to the account. Yet, employer contributions to the HSA are a good enticement for employees to enroll in an BSA-qualified plan. Unlike HRAs and health FSAs, which can be coupled with any type of health plan or can stand alone as the only employer health benefit, an HSA can be used only if it is coupled with a high-deductible plan that\nmeets specific criteria as outlined in Table 7-1 below.\n\n             Table 7-1 compares the features of HSAs, HRAs, and the long\u00ad established health FSAs.\n\n\nTABLE\t7\u00b71\nComparison of Health Care Accounts\n\t\n\n\nHealth Savings Account (HSA)\tHealth Reim- bursement Arrangement (HRA)\t\nFlexible Spend- ing Account (FSA)\nEligibility Requirements\nWho can set up an account\n\n\n\nl\tIndividuals and employees covered by a qualified HDHP and no other health insurance, except specifically listed coverages.\nCannot be enrolled in Medicare or claimed as a dependent on another's tax return.\tOnly employers.\tOnly employers.\nHealth Plan Requirements\nAecom- panying health plan requirements\tHDHP must meet federal requirements.\n\u25a0\tMinimum deductible*\n$1,200-Self-only coverage\n$2,400-Family coverage\n\u25a0\tMaximum out-of-pocket\u2022\n$5,950-Self-only coverage\n$11,900-Family coverage\n\n\u20222011 amounts; adjusted annually for inflation.\tNone.

Because several different payments contribute to TrOOP, CMS awarded a contract to NDC Health to provide coordination-of-benefits systems. NDC Health is responsible for systems that will monitor TrOOP on a pharmacy level so that beneficiaries can question their pharmacists about how close they are to catastrophic coverage. To ensure accuracy of this information, NDC Health is required to route claims for benefits paid by entities other than Medicare to the prescription drug plans. This requirement ensures that what seniors pay at pharmacies takes into account the appropriate level of their Medicare coverage.\n\n\nTABLE\t21-1\nMedicare Part D Standard Benefit Design Parameters\n\n\t\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\nAfter the deductible is met, the beneficiary pays 25% of covered costs up to total prescription costs meeting the initial coverage limit\tDeductible\t$265\t$275\t$295\t$310\t$310\nCoverage gap (donut hole) begins at this point\tInitial coverage limit\t$2,400\t$2,510\t$2,700\t$2,830\t$2,840\nIncluding the coverage gap, catastrophic coverage starts after this point\tTotal covered Part D drug out-of-pocket spending\t$5,451.25\t$5,726.25\t$6,153.75\t$6,440.00\nplus a\n$250\nbrand rebate\t$6,447.50\nplus a 50%\nbrand\ndiscount\nTrue out-of- pocket costs including\nthe donut hole (deductible+ initial coverage+ coverage gap = true out-of- pocket (TrOOP) cost)\tTrue\nout-of-pocket threshold\t$265.00\n$533.75\nSi3,051.25\t$275.00\n$558.75\nSi3,216.25\t$295.00\n$601.25\nSi3,453.75\t$310.00\n$630.00\nSi3,610.00\t$310.00\n$632.50\nSi3,607.50\n\t\t$3,850.00\t$4,050.00\t$4,350.00\t$4,550.00\t$4,550.00\n\tCatastrophic Coverage Benefit\n\tGeneric/ preferred multisource drug\t$2.15\t$2.25\t$2.40\t$2.50\t$2.50*\n\tOther drugs\t$5.35\t$5.60\t$6.00\t$6.30\t$6.30*\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Coverage is either the greater of 5%, or the values in the table above.

                    "text": "KB-3 - Taxable & Non-Taxable Employee Benefits - What about employee personal use of a company vehicle?\n\n\tPersonal use of a company-owned vehicle is considered part of an employee's taxable income and keeping accurate documentation is vital in determining what percentage of the vehicle's mileage constitutes personal use. lf you can't determine business versus personal use, the value of the vehicle would be I00%\ttaxable to the employee.\n\n\tNormally, employers must withhold employment taxes (and pay their share of those taxes). However, for federal and state income taxes, employers can choose to withhold taxes or not, but only if they notify the employee of that decision beforehand and include the value of the employee's personal use of the company vehicle in Boxes I, 3, 5 and 14 of his or her Form W-2.\n\n\tHow employers determine the value of company car usage is somewhat complicated. There are four methods available to value an employee's personal use of a company vehicle:\n\n\u2022\tGeneral valuation rule. The value is based on fair market value (FMV), defined as the amount the employee would have to pay to a third party to lease the same or similar vehicle in the same geographic area where the employee used the vehicle.\n\n\u2022\t\tCommuting valuation rule. The value is equal to the cost of each trip from home to work or work to home multiplied by $1.50. There are very strict requirements for using this method of valuation, including a written policy limiting the employee's use almost entirely to commuting to work and back.\n\n\u2022\t\tCents-per-mile. The most common method of valuation, this rule allows employers to multiply the business standard mileage rate (57.5 cents per mile less up to 5.5 cents per mile if the employer doesn't provide fuel) by the total number of miles the employee drives the vehicle for personal use.\n\nFleet average. Allows employers operating a fleet of 20 or more qualifying vehicles to use the annual lease value of the vehicle (as specified by an IRS table that bases annual lease value on a vehicle's fair market value) multiplied by the percentage of personal miles driven out of total miles driven by the employee. This amount also is subject to a fuel adjustment.\n\n\tThe cents-per-mile and fleet average methods can't be used if the FMV of the vehicle exceeded a certain base value (adjusted annually for inflation), on the first date the vehicle is made available to the employee for personal use. In general, employers that adopt the cents-per-mile rule must continue to use it for all subsequent years in which the vehicle qualifies for it. An employer can, however, use the commuting valuation rule for any year the vehicle qualifies."

The change does not affect insulin, even if purchased without a prescription, or other health care expenses such as medical devices, eye glasses, contact lenses, co-pays and deductibles.\n\nReferences:\n1 Rev.

                    "text": "KB-1 - Claims Under a Health Care FSA\n\tA health care FSA can reimburse a participant only for properly substantiated claims for medical expenses.1 What constitutes a \"properly substantiated\" claim? As with insurance coverage generally, a written statement from an independent third party describing the medical expense and indicating the amount of the expense is necessary.\n\tIn determining whether, under all the facts and circumstances, employees are being reimbursed for inadequately substantiated claims, special scrutiny is given to other arrangements, such as employer-to-employee loans, that are related to the employee premium payments or actual or projected employee claims.\n\nClaims incurred\n\tMedical expenses reimbursed under a health care FSA must be incurred during the participant's period of coverage under the FSA2 Expenses are treated as having been incurred when the participant receives medical care that gives rise to the medical expenses, and not when the participant is formally billed or charged for, or pays for, the medical care.\n\tFor example, if an employee has an eye exam on December 29 but does not formally receive a bill until the following year, the eye exam expense is treated as incurred in the year the eye exam was done.\n\tAlso, expenses are not treated as incurred during a period of FSA coverage if\nthey are incurred before the later of the date:\n\t1. the health care FSA is first in existence; or\n\t2. the participant first becomes enrolled. Advance reimbursements are expressly disallowed.\n\nClaims submitted after year end\n\tTypically, plan administrators allow some time after the end of the plan year for participants to submit, for payment, claims incurred during the plan year.\n\tPointer: Participants should be given a deadline by which they must submit their claims.\n\tFor most FSAs, the extra amount of time after the plan year ends (i.e., a \"run\u00ad out period\") during which participants may submit claims is generally in the range of 90 to 120 days. The FSA's recordkeeping system will have to keep track of when the claims were incurred so that submitted claims can be correctly allocated between current and prior plan years.\n\tA run-out period is different from a grace period under IRS guidance allowing for claims to be incurred and submitted up to two and a half months after the end of the plan year (see ,\u00b6 2205). Expenses must be incurred during the plan year and the grace period (if any) but reimbursement for those expenses still may be submitted and paid during a run-out period. The IRS has not addressed how long a run-out period can be.\n\n1 Prop. Reg. \u00a7 1.125-5.\n2 Prop. Reg. \u00a7 1.125-5.\n"

Employers who are considering the introduction of LTC should ask about the carrier's track record of benefits payment and find out its ratings from the financial ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best or Standard & Poors, which evaluate future claims-paying abilities. It is also advisable to ask about the kind of support a claimant can expect and what the claims-adjudication process involves, once benefit triggers have been met and the waiting period has been satisfied.\n\nBenefit Triggers\n           Insureds are eligible to receive benefits under the policy when they become either functionally dependent or cognitively impaired and have fulfilled a waiting period requirement. To prove functional dependency, an insured must be unable to perform, without substantial assistance from another person, at least two of the six activities of daily living (ADLs: bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring, and continence) because of a loss of functional capacity that is expected to last for a period of at least 90 days. The 90-day period requirement, a part of what qualifies the plan for tax-favored status, is not a \"waiting\" period. It indicates only the expectation by a medical professional that an insured will be unable to perform any two ADLs for at least 90 days without substantial assistance from another person (hands-on or stand-by). Its purpose is to ensure that the particular illness or disability is long-term in nature.\n\nSeparate Cognitive Impairment Trigger\n            An insured can qualify for benefit payments without being certified AOL\u00ad dependent if he or she is determined to have a severe cognitive impairment that requires substantial supervision to protect the person from threats to health and safety. The insured individual should be expected to demon\u00ad strate a loss or deterioration in intellectual capacity that is (a) comparable to (and includes) Alzheimer's disease and similar forms of irreversible dementia, and (b) measured by clinical evidence and standardized tests that reliably measure impairment in the individual's (i) short- or long-term memory, (ii) orientation as to people, place, or time, and (iii) deductive or abstract reasoning.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 45 - Basics of ERISA - Benefit Claims Procedures - Claims Procedures for Welfare Benefit Plans\n    Every welfare benefit plan must establish a claims procedure to process claims for benefits made by participants and beneficiaries. The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has issued regulations that provide new standards for processing claims under group health and group disability plans.\n    In July, 2010, the IRS, EBSA, and the HHS issued interim final regulations that added a number of requirements for internal claims procedures and appeals. The new rules implement the claims appeals requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111-148). These ACA changes are effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, though the Labor Department has provided for a grace period. Claims procedures under health reform are discussed at r 934\n    A plan that denies a claim for plan benefits must give the claimant adequate written notice of the denial. The claimant must also receive a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial (Reference 1 below).\n    The rules for filing a claim must be described in the summary plan description (SPD) (see r 110). A poorly written SPD that does not clearly specify a time limit for claims may excuse an employee from meeting the deadline (Reference 2 below).\n    The Eleventh Circuit has ruled that relevant medical records do not have to be supplied to a participant until after the decision to grant or deny a disability benefits claim has been made (Reference 3 below).\n\nNecessary information\n    A notice of a claim denial must state, in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the claimant, the following information:\n1. The specific reasons for the denial of the claim;\n2. A specific reference to the pertinent plan provision on which the denial is based;\n3. A description of any additional material or information that is necessary for a claimant to perfect the claim;\n4. An explanation of why the additional material or information needed to perfect the claim is necessary; and\n5. A description of the steps necessary (i.e., the appeals procedure) if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.\n    Pointer: If a participant brings a lawsuit claiming that an administrator's decision to deny benefits was made in bad faith, the fact that an administrator can show that these procedures were adhered to could help the administrator avoid liability for punitive damages (Reference 4 below).\n\nAdministrator as fiduciary\n    When a plan administrator denies a participant's claim for benefits, the administrator is acting as a fiduciary and so must meet the rules governing the conduct of fiduciaries.\n\nDisability benefit claims\n    At the initial level, disability claims must be resolved within 45 days of receipt. A plan may extend the decision-making period for an additional 30 days for reasons beyond the control of the plan. If, after this first extension, the plan administrator determines that it will still be unable, again for reasons beyond the control of the plan, to make a decision, the plan may extend decision-making for a second 30-day period.\n    During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan. Reviews of disability claim denials must be completed within 45 days of receipt of the claimant's request for review by the plan. Plans providing disability benefits may extend the decision\u00admaking time on review for an additional 45-day period if the plan administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim (Reference 5 below).\n    Final disability claims regs EBSA has issued final regulations that would enhance existing disability benefit claims procedures under ERISA Sec.503 (Reference 6 below). Note, however, that the Labor Department delayed the applicability date of these regulations until April 1, 2018, for ERISA plans to comply with a final rule amending the claims procedure requirements applicable to disability benefits. In issuing these regulations, EBSA hopes to apply to disability benefits many of the claims procedural protections and safeguards that have been applied to group health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The purpose of the regulation would improve the current procedural protections for workers who become disabled and make claims for disability benefits from an employee benefit plan.\n    \nThe regulations make the following major changes to the internal claims procedures for disability plans:\n claims and appeals must be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making the benefit determination;\n benefit denial notices must contain a complete discussion of why the plan denied the claim and the standards applied in reaching the decision, including the basis for disagreeing with the views of health care professionals, vocational professionals, or with disability benefit determinations by the Social Security Administration (SSA);\n claimants must be given timely notice of their right to access to their entire claim file and other relevant documents and be guaranteed the right to present evidence and testimony in support of their claim during the review process;\n claimants must be given notice and a fair opportunity to respond before denials at the appeals stage are based on new or additional evidence or rationales;\n plans cannot prohibit a claimant from seeking court review of a claim denial based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the plan if the plan failed to comply with the claims procedure requirements unless the violation was the result of a minor error;\n certain rescissions of coverage are to be treated as adverse benefit determinations triggering the plan's appeals procedures; and\n required notices and disclosures issued under the claims procedure regulation must be written in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.\n\n  Conflicts of interest. The final rule requires that decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or similar matters with respect to any individual must not be made based upon the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of disability benefits. For example, a plan cannot provide bonuses based on the number of denials made by a claims adjudicator. Similarly, a plan cannot contract with a medical expert based on the expert's reputation for outcomes in contested cases, rather than base on the expert's professional qualifications.\n  Right to appoint representative. The claims procedure of an ERISA-covered plan cannot \"preclude an authorized representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.\" In addition, prior department guidance on the claims procedure regulation confirms that authorized representatives are entitled to notifications in connection with initial claim determinations and appeals. Although a plan may establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant, the procedure cannot prevent claimants from choosing for themselves who will act as their representative or preclude them from designating an authorized representative for the initial claim, an appeal of an adverse benefit determination, or both. The plan must include any procedures for designating authorized representatives in the plan's claims procedures and in the plan's summary plan description (SPD) or a \nseparate document that accompanies the SPD. SPDs must satisfy the style and format requirements for SPDs in ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2520.102-2, and include a statement that the plan's claims procedures are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document (Reference 7 below).\n\n  Disclosure requirements. Under the final disability claims regulations, benefit denial notices must contain a more complete discussion of why the plan denied a claim and the standards used in making the decision. For example, the notices must include a discussion of the basis for disagreeing with a disability determination made by the SSA if presented by the claimant in support of his or her claim. Also, benefit denial notices must include a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, the entire claim file and other relevant documents.\n Benefit denial notices also have to include the internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the plan that were used in denying a claim or a statement that none were used. Currently, instead of including these internal rules and protocols, benefit denial notices have the option of including a statement that such rules and protocols were used in denying the claim and that a copy will be provided to the claimant upon request.\n\n  Deemed exhaustion. If plans do not adhere to all disability claims processing rules, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, unless the violation was the result of a minor error and other specified conditions are met. If the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, the claim or appeal is deemed denied on review without the exercise of discretion by a fiduciary and the claimant may immediately pursue his or her claim in court. The final rule also provides that the plan must treat a claim as re-filed on appeal upon the plan's receipt of a court's decision rejecting the claimant's request for review.\n  Coverage rescissions. Rescissions of coverage, including retroactive terminations due to alleged misrepresentation of fact (e.g. errors in the application for coverage) must be treated as adverse benefit determinations, thereby triggering the plan's appeals procedures. Rescissions for non-payment of premiums are not covered by this provision.\n  Culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The disability claims final rule requires that benefit denial notices have to be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner in certain situations. The final rule essentially adopts the ACA standard for group health benefit notices. Specifically, if a disability claimant's address is in a county where 10 percent or more of the population is literate only in the same non-English language, benefit denial notices must include a prominent statement in the relevant non-English language about the availability of language services. The plan would also be required to provide a verbal customer assistance process in the non-English language and provide written notices in the non-English language upon request.\n\nTiming of group health plan claims\n   Decisions on urgent health care claims must be made within 72 hours from the time the claim is made. There is also a 72-hour limit for decisions on appeals of denials of urgent care claims. For decisions on non-urgent claims, the regulations make a distinction between pre-service claims (group health claims that involve access to medical care) and post-service claims (claims that involve purely the payment or reimbursement of costs for medical care that has already been provided). The regulations require that pre-service claims be decided within a maximum of 15 days at the initial level, and 30 days on review of an adverse benefit determination. Decisions on post-service claims are subject to a maximum time period of 30 days for the initial decision and a maximum of 60 days on review of a denied claim (Reference 8 below).\n   During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan.\n   Notice requirements. The regulations create notice requirements in certain circumstances. In situations involving pre-service claims, plans will be required to provide a notice informing claimants that they failed to properly file a claim, if such is the case. However, this requirement will only be triggered by a communication from a claimant or a health care professional representing the claimant, and the notice may be provided orally unless requested in writing.\n   The regulations require that a plan inform a claimant of any protocol that was relied upon in denying a claim, and either supply the relevant protocol with the notice of denial or inform the claimant of its availability from the plan upon request and free of charge. Also, notifications of claim denials based on medical necessity, experimental treatment, or other similar exclusions or limits must either explain the scientific judgment of the plan or include a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request (Reference 9 below).\n   Appeal of claim denials. Claimants must be afforded 180 days in which to bring an appeal of a denied claim. The review must be conducted by a fiduciary who is neither the party who made the initial adverse determination nor a subordinate of that party (Reference 10 below). A plan administrator's affirmance of the denial of disability benefits in a first-level internal appeal is not an \"adverse benefit determi\u00ad nation\" and, as such, an ERISA plan is not required to provide a claimant with at least 180 days to file a mandatory second appeal (Reference 11 below).\n   The fiduciaries who review a claim denial that is based on a medical judgment must consult with a health care professional with appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the claim. The consultant must also be independent of any health care professional consulted in making the initial adverse benefit determination in that the reviewer must be different from, and not subordinate to, the individual involved in the initial determination. The reviewer need not be unaffiliated with the health plan in question.\n\nAppeals process under ACA\n   Under health reform legislation, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims (see KB-1 Topic 934).\n \nFor more information ...\n   Rules governing fiduciary responsibility are discussed beginning at r 25. Judicial review of a benefit denial is discussed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 ERISA Sec. 503(I).\n2 Dodson v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society, CA-8, (1997).\n3 Glazer v.

If they are absent on the first day that the plan is in effect, they become covered the next day that they are actively at work.\n    Pointer: An insurer may agree to cover all employees on the plan's effective date even if they are on vacation, on leave, not scheduled to work that day, absent due to illness, or on temporary layoff.\n    Waiting period. New employees enrolling in an existing plan typically have to work a specified period of time or number of hours on a regular basis before becoming eligible for coverage. This waiting period varies in length from employer to employer but is often around three months. Group health plans and insurers cannot impose waiting periods that exceed 90 days (Reference 1 below).\n    Once an employee is eligible for the plan, the employee usually has a limited time period in which to enroll. An employee or eligible family member who does not enroll when first eligible, but later chooses to join the plan, may have to undergo a medical examination, and may not be covered for preexisting conditions.\n    Dependent coverage. Dependent coverage usually begins with the enrollment of the employee so that when the employee receives coverage, so do eligible dependents whom the employee has enrolled. An employee may be required to provide evidence of insurability in order to cover dependents who are not initially covered, unless the dependent is a newborn infant.\n    Adopted children. Group health plans that provide coverage for dependent children must treat children placed with participants or beneficiaries for adoption in the same manner as natural children. This rule applies from the time the child is placed for adoption, even if that placement ultimately fails to result in an adoption. In addition, at the time the child is placed for adoption and becomes covered under a participant's health plan, the plan may not restrict coverage solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of the child  (Reference 2 below).\n    Domestic partners. Some health plans define the term \"family\" broadly enough to include domestic partners of employees. Not all domestic partners, however, meet state law requirements for spousal equivalents.\n    Some employers have extended health benefits to domestic partners as spouses regardless of state laws.\n\nFor more information...\n    Rules governing coverage for domestic partners are addressed at KB-1 Topic 312.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2708, as added by Act Sec. 1201(4) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148), as amended by Affordable Care Act Sec. 10103(b).\n2 ERISA Sec. 609(c); PWBA Opinion Letter 95-18A, 7/27/95.\n"

In both scenarios, the goal is to take the burden of benefit introduction off of the employer. For larger employers, the carrier's role includes:\n\u25a0 Developing and executing the marketing campaign\n\u25a0 Setting up the administrative protocols for payroll deduction\n\u25a0 Overseeing customer support at a carrier-run call center\n\u25a0 Coordinating human resource training sessions and employee meetings\n\n           The employer's main responsibilities are confined to determining the eligible class and providing ongoing eligibility information, selecting a final plan design, reviewing marketing materials, and providing general plan support. Support can be as simple as allowing the communications material to be co-branded with the company logo and also permitting the carrier access to the employee population, so that it can conduct an effective communications campaign.\n\n           LTC insurance presents a different set of communications challenges than most other voluntary benefit offerings. LTC is not an issue that people like to think about and so people often rely on misconceptions about the likelihood of need or the sources for funding. Most applicants are not familiar with the coverage and sometimes confuse it with other, existing benefits, such as long-term disability. In order to provide the prospective applicants with the information they need when considering the benefit's purchase, numerous communications \"touches\" are needed, using various media, including Web-based communications.\n \n           Web enrollments have become increasingly popular, as employees seem to appreciate the convenience of learning about and enrolling in the benefit online. Online enrollments are largely limited to guaranteed issue scenarios, though it is also possible to download medical applications, when underwriting is required.\n\n"

Coverage enrollment may be restricted to open and special enrollment periods, and special enrollment periods must be established for COBRA qualifying events. (Reference 1 below)\n\n\tGuaranteed availability of coverage. Subject to the following provisions regarding enrollment, and special rules for network plans and financial capacity limits, every health insurer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market in a state \"must accept every employer and individual in the State that applies for such coverage.\" (Reference 2 below)\n\n\tEnrollment. Insurers may restrict enrollment in coverage to open or special enrollment periods, and must establish special enrollment periods for COBRA qualifying events. (Reference 3 below) A health insurance issuer in the group market must permit an employer to purchase health insurance coverage for a group health plan at any point during the year. In the case of health insurance coverage offered in the small group market, a health insurance issuer may limit the availability of coverage to an annual enrollment period that begins November 15 and extends through December 15 of each year in the case of a plan sponsor that is unable to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules. (Reference 4 below) A health insurance issuer in the group and individual market must establish special enrollment periods for qualifying events as defined under ERISA Sec. 603. Enroll\u00ad ees must be provided 30 calendar days after the date of the qualifying event to elect coverage. These special enrollment periods are in addition to any other special enrollment periods that are required under federal and state law. (Reference 5 below)\n\n\tFinancial capacity limits. A health insurer may deny health insurance cover\u00ad age in the group or individual market if the issuer has demonstrated that it:\n\n\t1. lacks the financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage; and\n\t2. is applying this provision uniformly to all individuals and employers in the individual or group market in the state consistent with applicable state law and without regard to the claims experience of those individuals, employ\u00ad ers and their employees (and their dependents), or any health status\u00ad related factor relating to those individuals, employees and dependents. (Reference 6 below)\n\n\tA health insurer, upon denying health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans in a state, may not offer coverage in connection with group health plans in the individual or group market in the state for a period of 180 days after the date coverage is denied, or until the issuer has demonstrated that the issuer has enough financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage, whichever date is later. (Reference 7 below)\n\n\tGuaranteed renewability of coverage. A health insurer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual or group market must renew or continue in force such coverage at the option of the plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, subject to the following general exceptions and provisions. (Reference 8 below)\n\n\tGeneral exceptions. An insurer may refuse to renew, or may discontinue coverage in the group or individual market if one or more of one of the following occur:\n \n\t1. the individual or plan sponsor has failed to pay premiums or contributions under the terms of the coverage, or the issuer has not received timely premium payments;\n\t2. the individual or plan sponsor has committed fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of coverage;\n\t3. the group plan sponsor has failed to comply with a material plan provision that relates to employer contribution or group participation rules, under applicable state law;\n\t4. the issuer ceases to offer coverage in the market in accordance with the rules requiring uniform termination of coverage, and applicable state law;\n\t5. when an insurer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan no longer has any enrollee in connection with the plan who lives, resides, or works in the issuer's service area (or in the area in which the issuer is authorized to do business), and in the case of the small group market, the issuer would deny enrollment with regard to such plan under the special rules for network plans; or\n\t6. when the health insurance coverage is made available in the small or large group market only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer in the association (based on which the coverage is provided), ceases, but only if the coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor related to any covered individual. (Reference 9 below)\n\n\tUniform modification of coverage. At the time of renewal, a health insurer may modify the health insurance coverage for a product offered to a group plan:\n\t\u2022 in the large group market, or\n\t\u2022 in the case of the small group market, only if, other than only through one or more bona fide associations, the modification is consistent with state law and effective on a uniform basis among group health plans with that product. (Reference 10 below)\n\n\tRetiree-only plan and excepted benefits. The health reform provisions involving guaranteed availability and renewability do not apply to retiree-only plans or excepted benefits. Excepted benefits generally include dental-only and vision\u00ad only plans, most health flexible spending arrangements, Medigap policies, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage. (Reference 11 below)\n\n\tLimitation on waiting periods. For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, group health plan waiting periods may not exceed 90 days. (Reference 12 below) The term \"waiting period\" means; with respect to a group health plan and an individual who is a potential participant or beneficiary in the plan, the period that must pass with respect to the individual before that individual is eligible to be covered for benefits under the terms of the plan.\n\n\tEligibility criteria. Eligibility conditions that are based solely on the lapse of a time period are permissible for no more than 90 days. Other conditions for eligibility under the terms of a group health plan are generally permissible unless the condition is designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation. If, under the terms of a plan, an employee may elect coverage that would begin on a date that does not exceed the 90-day waiting period limitation, the 90-day waiting period limitation is considered satisfied. Accordingly, a plan or issuer will not be considered to have violated PHSA \u00a7 2708 merely because employees take additional time to elect coverage. (Reference 13 below)\n\n\tCounting days. Final regulations clarify the method for counting days when applying a 90-day waiting period. Under the final regulations, due to the clear text of the ACA, the waiting period may not extend beyond 90 days and all calendar days are counted beginning on the enrollment date, including weekends and holidays. For a plan with a waiting period, \"enrollment date\" is defined as the first day of the waiting period. If, with respect to a plan or issuer imposing a 90-day waiting period, the 91st day is a weekend or holiday, the plan or issuer may choose to permit coverage to be effective earlier than the 91st day, for administrative convenience. However, a plan or issuer may not make the effective date of coverage later than the 91st day. (Reference 14 below)\n\n\tAlso, an employee who was terminated and then rehired may be treated as newly eligible upon rehire and so, required to meet the plan's eligibility criteria and waiting period anew, if reasonable under the circumstances and not a subterfuge to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation. (Reference 15 below)\n\n\tExample 1: Employer W's group health plan provides for coverage to begin on the first day of the first payroll period on or after the date an employee is hired and completes the applicable enrollment forms. Enrollment forms are distributed on an employee's start date. Employee A is hired and starts on October 31, which is the first day of the payroll period. On November 2, A completes and files all the forms necessary to enroll in the plan. Ns coverage under the plan becomes effective on November 14, which is the first day of the first payroll period after A completes the enrollment forms.\n\n\tUnder the terms of W's plan, coverage may become effective as early as October 31, depending on when A completes the applicable enrollment forms. Under the terms of the plan, when coverage becomes effective is dependent solely on the length of time taken by A to complete the enrollment materials. Therefore, under the terms of the plan, A may elect coverage that would begin on a date that does not exceed the 90-day waiting period limitation, and the plan complies with PHSA \u00a7 2708.\n\n\tExample 2: Employer X's group health plan limits eligibility for coverage to full-time employees. Coverage becomes effective on the first day of the calen\u00ad dar month following the date the employee becomes eligible. Employee B begins working full time for Employer X on April 11. Prior to this date, B worked part time for X. B enrolls in the plan and coverage is effective May l.\n\n\tThe period from April 11 through April 30 is a waiting period. The period while B was working part time is not part of the waiting period because B was not in a class of employees eligible for coverage under the terms of the plan while working part time, and full-time versus part-time status is a bona fide employment-based condition that is not considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation.\n\n\tOrientation period. For group health plans and group health insurance issuers for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, a reasonable and bona-fide employment-based orientation period must not, as one of the sub\u00ad stantive eligibility conditions to be met to be eligible for an employer's health plan, extend beyond one month. The acceptable one month orientation period is calculated by adding one calendar month and subtracting one calendar day from the employee's start date. Thus, if the start date is May 3rd, June 2nd is the last acceptable orientation day. If the employee starts October 1st, then October 31st must be the last orientation day. (Reference 16 below)\n\n\tHowever, in instances in which the following month does not have a corresponding date, such as January 30, then the last permitted day of orienta\u00ad tion is the last day of the next calendar month, which in this example would be February 28th. Plans with orientation dates not exceeding one month and with a waiting period for health coverage that does not exceed 90 days, beginning on the first day after the orientation period, will not be considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90- day waiting period limit.\n\n\tVariable hour employees. If a group health plan conditions eligibility on an employee regularly working a specified number of hours per period (or working full time), and it cannot be determined that a newly-hired employee is reasonably expected to regularly work that number of hours per period (or work full time), the plan may take a reasonable period of time to determine whether the employee meets the plan's eligibility condition. Such eligibility condition may include a measurement period (such as 12 consecutive calendar months) that is consistent with the time frame permitted for such determinations under Code Sec. 4980H. Except where a waiting period that exceeds 90 days is imposed after a measure\u00ad ment period, the time period for determining whether such an employee meets the plan's eligibility condition will not be considered to be designed to avoid compli\u00ad ance with the 90-day waiting period limitation if:\n\n\t\u25a1 coverage is made effective no later than 13 months from the employee's start date, plus\n\t\u25a1 if the employee's start date is not the first day of a calendar month, the time remaining until the first day of the next calendar month. (Reference 17 below)\n\n\tExample 3: Under Employer Y's group health plan, only employees who work full time (defined under the plan as regularly working 30 hours per week) are eligible for coverage. Employee C begins work for Employer Yon November 26 of Year 1. C's hours are reasonably expected to vary, with an opportunity to work between 20 and 45 hours per week, depending on shift availability and C's availability. Therefore, it cannot be determined at C's start date that C is reasonably expected to work full time. Under the terms of the plan, variable hour employees, such as C, are eligible to enroll in the plan if they are determined to be full time after a measurement period of 12 months. Coverage is made effective no later than the first day of the first calendar month after the applicable enrollment forms are received. C's 12-month measurement period ends November 25 of Year 2. C is determined to be full time and is notified of C's plan eligibility. If C then elects coverage, C's first day of coverage will be January 1 of Year 3.\n\n\tThe measurement period is not considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation (and is, therefore, permis\u00ad sible) because the plan may use a reasonable period of time to determine whether a variable hour employee is full time under PHSA \u00a7 2708 if the period of time is consistent with the time frame permitted for such determinations under Code Sec. 4980H. In such circumstances, the time period for determin\u00ad ing whether an employee is full time will not be considered to avoid the 90-day waiting period limitation if coverage can become effective no later than 13 months from C's start date, plus the time remaining until the first day of the next calendar month.\n\n\tExample 4: Employee D begins working 25 hours per week for Employer Z on January 3 and is considered a part-time employee for purposes of Z's group health plans. Z sponsors a group health plan that provides coverage to part\u00ad time employees after they have completed a cumulative 1,200 hours of service. D satisfies the plan's cumulative hours of service condition on December 15.\n\n\tThe cumulative hours of service condition with respect to part-time em\u00ad ployees is not considered to be designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation. Accordingly, coverage for D under the plan must begin no later than the 91st day after D works 1,200 hours. (If the plan's cumulative hours of service requirement were more than 1,200 hours, the requirement would be seen as designed to avoid compliance with the 90-day waiting period limitation.)\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2702.\n2 PHSA \u00a7 2702(a).\n3 PHSA \u00a7 2702(b) (1).\n4 HHS Reg.\u00a7 147.104(b) (l)(i).\n5 HHS Reg.\u00a7 147.104(b) (2), (3) and (4).\n6 PHSA \u00a7 2702(d)(l); HHS Reg.\u00a7 147.104(d)(l).\n7 PHSA \u00a7 2702(d)(2); HHS Reg.\u00a7 147.104(d) (2).

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 842 - Health Care Reform - Eligibility Rules - Grandfathered Health Plans\n\n\tAccording to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), certain group health plans and health insurance coverage which are in effect as of March 23, 2010, and which make no prohibited changes in plan provisions, are subject only to certain provisions of the ACA. These plans are called grandfathered health plans.\n\n\tACA provisions that apply. A grandfathered plan is subject to the following provisions of the ACA:\n\n\t\t\u2022 extension of adult child coverage(Reference 1 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 880);\n\t\t\u2022 prohibition on rescinding coverage (Reference 2 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 880);\n\t\t\u2022 elimination of annual and lifetime limits (Reference 3 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 880);\n\t\t\u2022 prohibition on excessive waiting periods (Reference 4 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 892);\n\t\t\u2022 requirements to provide uniform explanations of coverage and standardized definitions (Reference 5 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 926);\n\t\t\u2022 insurer requirements to provide loss-ratio reports and rebate premiums if loss ratios fall below 80% (Reference 6 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 920); and\n\t\t\u2022 elimination of preexisting condition exclusions (Reference 7 below) (see ,KB-1 Topic 894).\n\n\tDefinition of grandfathered health plan coverage. A group health plan or group health insurance coverage does not cease to be grandfathered health plan coverage merely because one or more (or even all) individuals enrolled on March 23, 2010, cease to be covered, provided that the plan or group health insurance coverage has continuously covered someone since March 23, 2010 (not necessarily the same person, but at all times at least one person). This determination is made separately with respect to each benefit package made available under a group health plan or health insurance coverage.(Reference 8 below)\n\t\n\tDisclosure of grandfathered status. To maintain status as a grandfathered health plan, a plan or health insurance coverage must:\n\t\t\n\t\t1. include a statement, in any plan materials provided to participants or beneficiaries describing the benefits provided under the plan or health insurance coverage, that the plan or health insurance coverage believes that it is a grandfathered health plan, and\n\t\t2. provide contact information for questions and complaints.\n\n\tDocumentation of plan or policy terms. In addition, to maintain status as a grandfathered health plan, a plan must maintain records documenting the terms of the plan that were in effect on March 23, 2010, and any other documents necessary to verify, explain, or clarify its status as a grandfathered health plan. Such documents could include intervening and current plan documents, health insurance policies, certificates or contracts of insurance, summary plan descriptions, documentation of premiums or the cost of coverage, and documentation of required employee contribution rates. The plan must make such records available for examination.\n\n\tFamily members enrolling after March 23, 2010. If family members of an individual who is enrolled in a grandfathered health plan as of March 23, 2010, enroll in the plan after March 23, 2010, the plan or health insurance coverage is also a grandfathered health plan with respect to the family members.  \n\t\n\tNew employees joining current plan. A group health plan that provided coverage on March 23, 2010, generally is also a grandfathered health plan with respect to new employees (whether newly hired or newly enrolled) and their families who enroll in the grandfathered health plan after March 23, 2010.9 If the principal purpose of a merger, acquisition, or similar business restructuring is to cover new individuals under a grandfathered health plan, the plan ceases to be a grandfathered health plan.\n\n\tChange in plan eligibility. A group health plan ceases to be a grandfathered health plan if:\n \n\t1. Employees are transferred into the plan (the transferee plan) from a plan under which the employees were covered on March 23, 2010 (the transferor plan).\n\t2. The transferee plan is treated as an amendment to the transferor plan, and this results in a loss of grandfather status under the cessation of grandfathered status rules discussed below.\n\t3. There was no bona fide employment-based reason to transfer the employees into the transferee plan. For this purpose, changing the terms or cost of coverage is not a bona fide employment-based reason.\n\nFor plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, bona fide employment\u00adbased reasons include when:\n\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is being eliminated because the issuer is exiting the market;\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is being eliminated because the issuer no longer offers the product to the employer;\n\t\u25a1 low or declining participation by plan participants in the benefit package makes it impractical for the plan sponsor to continue to offer the benefit package;\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is eliminated from a multiemployer plan as agreed upon as part of the collective bargaining process; or\n\t\u25a1 a benefit package is eliminated for any reason and multiple benefit packages covering a significant portion of other employees remain available to the employees being transferred.(Reference 1 below)\n\n\tCollective bargaining agreements. In the case of health insurance coverage maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements ratified before March 23, 2010, the coverage is a grandfathered health plan at least until the date on which the last agreement relating to the coverage that was in effect on March 23, 2010, terminates. Thus, before the last of the applicable collective bargaining agreement terminates, any health insurance coverage provided pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements is a grandfathered health plan, even if there is a change in issuers during the period of the agreement. This provision applies only to insured plans maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and not to self-insured plans.(Reference 11 below)\n\n\tChanges causing cessation of grandfathered status. Certain changes made to the terms of a plan or health insurance coverage will cause the plan or coverage to cease to be a grandfathered health plan. These changes include the following:(Reference 12 below)\n\t\t\n\t\t\u2022 eliminating all or substantially all benefits to diagnose or treat a particular condition;\n\t\t\u2022 increasing a percentage cost-sharing requirement (such as coinsurance);\n\t\t\u2022 increasing a fixed-amount cost-sharing requirement other than a copayment;\n\t\t\u2022 increasing a fixed-amount copayment by more than the greater of $5 (adjusted annually for medical inflation) or a percentage equal to medical inflation plus 15 percentage points;\n\t\t\u2022 decreasing the employer's contribution rate by more than five percentage points; and\n\t\t\u2022 adding or tightening an overall annual limit on the dollar value of benefits.\n\n\t\n\tChanges to only one of several benefits options. In the case where only one of several plan options is changed such that it loses grandfathered status, only that option loses status, while the \"unchanged\" options retain grandfathered status.(Reference 13 below)\n\n\tChanges in employer contribution through restructured tiers. If a group health plan modifies the tiers of coverage it had on March 23, 2010 (for example, from self-only and family to a multi-tiered structure of self-only, self-plus-one, self\u00ad plus-two, and self-plus-three-or-more), the employer contribution for any new tier would be tested by comparison to the'contribution rate for the corresponding tier on March 23, 2010. For example, if the employer contribution rate for family coverage was 50% on March 23, 2010, the employer contribution rate for any new tier of coverage other than self-only (i.e., self-plus-one, self-plus-two, self-plus-three or more) must be within 5 percentage points of 50% (i.e., at least 45%),\n\t\n\tIncrease in copayment level for just one category of services. If a plan increases the copayment higher than the allowed standard for just one category of services (i.e., outpatient services), the plan loses grandfathered status. Each change in cost sharing is tested separately.\n\n\tChanges in contribution rates unknown to issuers. Until final regulations are issued, a group health plan will generally not immediately be treated as losing grandfathered status based on a change in an employer's contribution rate if, (1) upon renewal, the plan issuer requires the plan sponsor to make a representation regarding its contribution rate for the plan year covered by the renewal, as well as its contribution rate on March 23, 2010 and (2) if the issuer's policies, certificates, or contracts of insurance disclose in a prominent and effective manner that plan sponsors are required to notify the issuer if the contribution rate changes at any point during the plan year. This relief would no longer apply as of the earlier of the first date on which the issuer knows that there has been at least a 5-percentage\u00ad point reduction or the first date on which the plan no longer qualifies for grandfathered status for a reason unrelated to the 5-percentage-point reduction.(Reference 14 below)\n\n\tChanges to insurance coverage. A group health plan does not cease to be a grandfathered health plan merely because the plan (or its sponsor) enters into a new policy, certificate, or contract of insurance after March 23, 2010. (Reference 15 below) For example, a plan that enters into a contract with a new issuer or a new policy that is issued with an existing issuer does not lose grandfathered plan status. This applies to such changes to group health insurance coverage that are effective on or after November 15, 2010. It does not apply retroactively to such changes that were effective before this date,\n \n\n \nREFERENCES \n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2714.\n2 PHSA \u00a7 2712.\n3 PHSA \u00a7 2711.\n4 PHSA \u00a7 2708\n5 PHSA \u00a7 2708,\n6 PHSA \u00a7 2718.\n7 PHSA \u00a7 2704.\n8 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-1251(a); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251(a).\n9 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9815-1251(b); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251 (b).\n10 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9815-1251(b)(2)(iii); ERISA Reg.\u00a72590.715-1251(b) (2) (iii).\n11 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-1251(f); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251(!).\n12 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-1251(g)(l); ERISA Reg.\u00a7 2590.715-1251 (g) (1).\n13 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Imple\u00ad mentation Part II, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/ faq-aca2.html, October 8, 2010.\n14 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Imple\u00ad mentation Part I, www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq\u00ad aca.html, September 20, 2010.\n15 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9815-1251 (a)(1); ERISA Reg.\u00a72590.715-1251(a)(l).\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 21 - Social Insurance Programs - Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefits - Enrollment\n             Each individual entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Part B qualifies for Part D coverage. Individuals enrolled in traditional Medicare will receive their benefits through a stand-alone PDP. Individuals enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan will have coverage through an MA-PD plan. (See Appendix 21.2 for a list of communications materials used to educate beneficiaries about Part D.)\n\n             Most eligible Part D beneficiaries were able to choose a Part D plan starting on November 15, 2005. Two special groups were identified for consideration:\n\u25a0 Dual eligibles (individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid). These individuals were automatically enrolled in a Part D plan. A dual eligible is a Medicare beneficiary who is currently receiving state Medicaid benefits. Medicaid drug coverage for Medicare eligibles was terminated on December 31, 2005. In order to continue drug coverage, dual eligibles were automatically assigned to qualifying plans starting in October 2005. These individuals can switch out of their automatically assigned plans every 30 days.\n\u25a0 Limited-income beneficiaries. These individuals were eligible for a low-income cost-sharing subsidy (LICS).\n\n            The Medicare Part D subsidy starts on the date when the dual-eligible senior becomes eligible. If a delay occurs in starting the senior on the pro\u00ad gram, the senior is eligible for retroactive coverage for prescription medications back to the eligibility date. Effective in 2011, the annual coordinated election period (also known as the annual open enrollment period (AEP)) will be from October 15 to December 7 for the 2012 plan year. (Note that the first-year open enrollment period was November 15, 2005, through May 15, 2006.) Beneficiaries have an option of at least two Part D plans per region.\n\n            Retirees must follow their employers' plan coverage rules to remain eligible for their retiree coverage. However, if retirees decide to leave their employer coverage midyear, they may enroll in a Medicare Part D plan only during the Medicare open enrollment period. For example, if a retiree left the employer's Part D plan in July, he or she would have to wait until the November open enrollment period for coverage for the following year. Exceptions are allowed for the following special circumstances:\n\u25a0 Beneficiaries who permanently move out of the plan service area\n\u25a0 Individuals entering, residing in, or leaving a long-term care facility\n\u25a0 Involuntary loss, reduction, or nonnotification of creditable coverage\n\u25a0 Other exceptional circumstances\n            Some Medicare patients may be subject to a late enrollment penalty if they do not sign up for Part D when they are first eligible. This late penalty fee is a carryover from Medicare Part B. Two categories of patients are at risk. The first group includes patients who were eligible for Medicare before January 2006 and had to sign up by May 15, 2006, to avoid a higher premium. The second group includes patients who became eligible for Medicare after January 2006 and had to sign up for Part D within 63 days after the end of their initial enrollment period to avoid a higher premium.\n\n             The higher premium will be based on an increase of at least 1 percent of the base beneficiary premium (i.e., $31.94 for 2010) per month for every month that they waited to enroll. This premium may change each year. For example, if John Doe is without creditable coverage for 18 months, his penalty is 18 percent (1 percent x 18 months) multiplied by $31.94 (base beneficiary premium) = $5.75. This amount would then be added to the monthly premium, for example $20.00. In this example, John Doe would pay a higher premium of $20.00 + $5.75 = $25.75.\n\n             The fees will be reflected in higher monthly premiums for the beneficiary's lifetime. However, if a Medicare beneficiary has a creditable coverage equivalent to or better than Part D (e.g., employer or retirement plan), this penalty does not apply.

After eligibility has been determined, the applicant is notified of the determination.\n\n             These individuals had a two-step enrollment process. First, they were prescreened for income and assets through an application process administered by the SSA. After approval from the SSA, the beneficiary had to choose a Part D plan after November 15, 2005. If the low-income-subsidy (LICS) beneficiary did not choose a Part D plan by May 15, 2006, he or she was automatically enrolled into a qualifying Part D plan. (Note that dual eligibles did not have to fill out SSA applications.)\n\n\n"

This current coverage is \"creditable.\" The retiree benefits coordinator for their employer is the contact person for determining whether their coverage is creditable.\n\n             Creditable coverage notices must be sent annually and at other times specified by Medicare. These notices are commonly sent when an active worker first becomes eligible for Medicare or when the employer group coverage changes. Most employers send creditable coverage notices with annual open enrollment materials sent to all active workers and retirees. Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) notices have no applicability to the Part D program.\n\n             CMS has issued guidance on the content, model language, and timing of creditable coverage notices that must be provided to Part D-eligible Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\n"

With all the complexity and regulations associated with employee benefit plans, employers should consult with an attorney or a benefits specialist to make sure that everything is set up properly.\n\u2022 Failing to include certain employees in the plan. The general rule is if one employee gets a tax-advantaged benefit (one paid for with pre-tax dollars) the same benefit has to be made available to all employees.\n\u2022 Providing benefits that aren't really needed. For instance, if most of the employees are young and healthy, there may not be any reason to offer life insurance.\n\u2022 Including family or friends in the health care plan. If there's a large claim by a non-employee and the insurer investigates the claim, the result could be disallowance of the claim or even cancellation of the policy.\n\u2022 Not enrolling new employees in plans during the open enrollment period. Most plans have a fixed time period for open enrollment and attempting to enroll a new employee later on requires proof of insurability, which can lead to problems for both the employee and the employer.\n\u2022 Failing to let employees know how much their benefits cost the employer. Benefit plans are expensive and employees will appreciate them more if they're made aware of exactly how costly those benefits are for the employer.\n\u2022 Absorbing all or most of the expense of the benefit plan themselves. Get the employees to share some of the expense. For example, roughly 90% of employers now require employee contributions to the employer's health care plan.\n\u2022 Doing a poor job of communicating with their employees about the plan. It can be a fine line, providing too much detail about plan options or not providing enough, but employees need to have a clear understanding of their options so they can make informed choices.\n\u2022 Accidentally misrepresenting the benefits offered when hiring a new employee. An employee can sue for the benefits promised during the hiring phase, even if those benefits don't agree with what is in the actual benefit plan documents.\n\u2022 Not having employees who choose not to participate in a benefit plan sign a waiver to that effect. If there's no document to the contrary, employees can sue, claiming that they were never offered the opportunity to participate in the plan.\n\u2022 Failing to notify the insurance company about changes in employee pay rates.\n\u2022 Failing to keep up with changes in benefit plan regulations. Employers need to make use of a lawyer, benefits consultant, or a service of some kind to keep them up to date on regulatory changes.\n\u2022 Failing to deposit employee retirement contributions into the plan's trust fund in a timely manner. The hard deadline to deposit these contributions is the fifteenth business day of the month after the contribution was deducted from the employee's pay.\n\u2022 Failing to notify participants of changes in the benefit plan. Employers are required to notify participants in a health care or retirement plan of any changes in that plan and make them aware of how those changes affect them.\n\u2022 Allowing employees to stay on health plan coverage too long. For instance, keeping an employee who's on FMLA leave on the health plan after coverage should have been terminated. Note: in that particular case the employer should terminate health coverage and offer the employee COBRA coverage instead.\n\u2022 Putting independent contractors on the company's health care plan. Adding contractors creates a multi-employer plan, which carries additional restrictions and reporting requirements (such as annual filing of an M-1 report).\n\u2022 Failing to properly backup and secure plan participant's personal data. In particular, employers who make use of benefit management software should make sure that it includes strong cybersecurity features.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Employee Benefit Marketing - Marketing Process\n\n\tAlthough the main goal of employee benefit marketing is to \"close the sale,\" the process involves two broad categories of activities: those that precede the sale and those that follow the sale. Presale activities include prospecting and the development and presentation of the group insurance proposal; postsale activities include the enrollment of employees and the actual installation, servicing, and renewal of the group insurance plan.\n\nProspecting\n\n\tProspecting is the first step in the marketing process. It involves persuading the employer (or the employer's broker or consultant) to accept a group insurance proposal from the insurance company (or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, HMO, PPO, or other provider of benefits or services). To be successful in actually presenting a proposal, prospecting also involves convincing the employer to provide the information necessary for the preparation of the proposal.\n\n\tThe process of prospecting varies for different segments of the group insurance market. For very small groups (under 10 or 15 employees), the plans marketed are often provided through MEWAs rather than through the traditional group insurance arrangements of insurance companies. Some of the sales activities in this segment are conducted by agents who specialize in group insurance, but a large portion of the sales activities is conducted by agents, brokers, or consultants whose primary sales activities take place in the individual marketplace. (In fact, the multiple-employer trusts of many insurance companies are actually considered for marketing purposes to be part of the product line of the individual insurance department rather than part of the group insurance department.) In many cases, the agent, broker, or consultant has had previous contacts with the employer concerning his or her personal or business insurance. However, it is also in the marketing to small groups that prospecting without known contacts (cold calling) is most likely to take place. Because of the modest premiums that these small groups generate, the agent, broker, or consultant usually carries out all of the sales activities (not just prospecting) with little direct involvement by representatives from the insurance company. It is also becoming increasingly common for insurers to issue proposals online. Because of the limited and relative inflexibility of products available for these small groups, training of agents, brokers, or consultants in this market is often oriented toward what products are available rather than toward group insurance planning in general.\n\n\tAs the size of groups increases, the chance of successful prospecting diminishes rapidly unless the agent, broker, or consultant (1) has a known contact who is a key person in an organization's decision-making process for group insurance matters and (2) has a more sophisticated understanding of group insurance. In these segments of the group insurance market, group representatives spend considerable time training agents, brokers, or consultants in the intricacies of group insurance and motivating them to develop prospects. For medium-sized groups, the agent, broker, or consultant may do the actual prospecting alone or with the group representative, or he or she may give qualified leads to the group representative who will perform this function.\n\n\tFor large groups, the situation is usually different because most large firms retain brokers or consultants to advise them on employee benefit programs and to aid them in the implementation of any decisions they make, including the placing of insurance coverages. Therefore, in this segment of the employee benefit market, prospecting is a two-part process. On one hand, there is intense competition among brokers and consultants to obtain the large firms as clients. On the other hand, clients are seldom successfully approached except through the broker or consultant. Therefore, the prospecting consists of group representatives (and representatives of the Blues and TPAs) who develop a close working relationship with the brokers or consultants to encourage the consideration of the group representatives' organization as a provider of group insurance or other employee benefit products or services.\n\nDeveloping the Proposal\n\nProposal\n\n\tIn the broadest sense, the development of a proposal for a benefit plan involves designing the benefit plan, calculating the premium rate or rates, and putting the proposal in its final form for presentation. Managed care and the availability of varied types of medical expense plans make proposal development especially challenging. Prior to managed care, an insurance company proposal could concentrate on coverage, benefits, and premium with a focus on its reputation for stability and prompt payment of claims. With the advent of managed care, proposals for medical expense coverage needed to address questions on the delivery of care under the managed care plan. Thus, the adequacy of the provider network-including its size, scope of services, and access-became prominent issues. Quality-including the credentials of providers, the accreditation of the plan, and performance measures of the plan-also became selection criteria for employers and their employees.\n\n\tIt is at the proposal stage of the marketing process that insurers do the majority of the underwriting for a case that they ultimately write. In effect, most insurance companies are saying that the benefit plan presented to the employer is probably acceptable to the company at the rates specified if the proposal leads to an application for coverage. However, most insurance companies \"hedge\" their positions and do not make an absolute commitment to write the coverage at this stage, except possibly for very large groups that the senior underwriting personnel have already reviewed . In many cases, field offices do the preliminary underwriting, and the proposal specifies that home office approval is necessary. In addition, the proposal includes any assumptions made in the preliminary underwriting that must be verified before the case is finally accepted. Finally, the proposal lists any underwriting conditions the employer or plan must meet before the insurer will write coverage (such as a certain percentage participation). Obtaining the necessary information for underwriting is often difficult for insurance companies, particularly when the agent, broker, or consultant primarily sells individual insurance. In the individual marketplace, the agent, broker, or consultant is accustomed to obtaining much of the necessary underwriting information at the time of application rather than before the sales presentation. Furthermore, the small employers that these agents, brokers, or consultants approach tend to be less sophisticated in group insurance matters than large employers are, and they often fail to see the necessity to provide detailed information at this point in the sales process. Consequently, for the sales process to continue past the prospecting stage, it is necessary that agents, brokers, and consultants recognize the importance of obtaining underwriting information and that they are willing and able to convey this importance to the employer.\n\n\tThe premium rates presented in the group insurance proposal are based on the employee census that the employer provides prior to the development of the proposal, and thus they are usually only tentative rates, a fact that is\nclearly stated in the proposal. The final premium rates are usually determined at the time a group insurance plan is installed and are based on the census of employees covered under the plan at its inception and possibly on the health of the employees.\n\n\tAlthough variations exist among insurance companies, most proposals contain at least the following information:\n\n\t\t\u2022 a description of each coverage included in the plan\n\t\t\u2022 a schedule of the tentative premium rates and the total premium for each coverage\n\t\t\u2022 a description of the persons eligible for coverage under the plan \n\t\t\u2022 any underwriting assumptions or conditions\n\t\t\u2022 details for servicing the plan, such as the procedures and facilities for administering claims\n\t\t\u2022 general information about the insurance company, including its size, financial strength, and products and services\n\n\tFor large group insurance cases, the proposal usually provides detailed information concerning the insurance company's retention and how the insurer calculates premium rates and reserves.\n\n\tAs with prospecting, the process of developing a proposal differs depending on whether coverage is for a small group, a large client that a broker or consultant controls, or a group that falls somewhere between these two extremes. For small groups that are written through MEWAs, the preparation of a proposal is usually a relatively simple matter. Because little or no flexibility is available for the coverages offered, the plan design consists primarily of an agent, broker, or consultant describing the available options and determining the employer's preferences. The agent, broker,' or consultant typically carries out the preliminary underwriting in the sense that it is his or her responsibility to determine whether the employer meets the trust's relatively rigid underwriting criteria. Because the rate structure is fairly simplified, the agent, broker, or consultant also determines the tentative premium based on the census data provided by the employer. The proposal typically consists of (1) a standard brochure or packet of information that describes the trust and its benefits and (2) a brief premium-calculation presentation that contains a list of the covered employees and the tentative premium the employer must pay for the initial coverage period.\n\n\tUnder some MEWAs, particularly when they are used to write coverage for groups larger than 10 or 15 employees, the insurance company or the administrator of the trust carries out the underwriting, premium calculations, and preparation of the proposal. Furthermore, as the size of the group written through the trust increases, the insurer may also request additional underwriting information (such as past claims history).\n\n\tThe situation is quite different for large groups. For group insurance cases that are not controlled by large brokers or consultants, the group representative plays a major role in the development of the proposal. It is usually the group representative, possibly along with the agent, broker, or consultant, who meets with the employer. Depending on the relationship between the employer and the agent, broker, or consultant, the group representative may have to put considerable effort into convincing the employer that it is worth the time to proceed with the proposal. This includes countering any of the employer's objections and convincing the employer that the insurance company can provide the products and services necessary to meet his or her needs. It is also at this time that the group representative must determine whether the employer is a serious prospect (that is, whether there is some possibility that the employer will add coverages or change insurers). In addition, the group representative must assess whether the employer is likely to meet the underwriting standards of the insurance company. For example, an insurance company may be unwilling to prepare a proposal for an employer that has a history of frequently changing insurers.\n\n\tIf the development of the proposal proceeds beyond the initial contact stage, the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative must (1) determine the employer's objectives, (2) aid the employer in designing the benefit plan for which the proposal will be made, and (3) obtain the information necessary to complete the development of the proposal. The data from the employer is then provided to the insurance company, usually through a field office. The rating and actual design of the proposal is normally conducted at the field office, but except for small cases the underwriting function is likely to be performed at the home office (or at a regional office in the case of large insurance companies). However, for very large cases, it is common for the insurance company to complete the entire process, not just the underwriting, at some level higher than the field office.\n\n\tTo complete the proposal, the insurance company obviously needs a description of the benefit plan desired and a census of employees (covered, not actively working, and on COBRA continuation) containing any information that affects underwriting or premium calculations. At a minimum, this information probably includes age and gender, but it may also include marital status, geographic location, income, and an indication of whether there are dependents. This census may have an actual list of employees by name or it may consist of aggregate data. In addition, most insurance companies commonly request the following information from the prospect or the prospect's agent, broker, or consultant:\n\n\t\t\u2022 the reason for transferring (unless it is a new case) \n\t\t\u2022 the nature of the employer's industry\n\t\t\u2022 a history of changes in the number of employees over the least 2 or 3 years\n\t\t\u2022 a statement indicating whether the plan is contributory and, if so, the amount of the employer's contribution\n\t\t\u2022 the length of time with the current insurer\n\t\t\u2022 premiums, rates, and claims experience with the current insurer for each line of coverage (usually for the previous 3 years)\n\t\t\u2022 a statement indicating whether collective bargaining is involved\n\t\t\u2022 copies of information about the current plan (such as benefit booklets or certificates of insurance)\n\t\t\u2022 the most recent premium statement from the current insurer\n\t\t\u2022 any renewal information from the current insurer for the past year or two\n\t\t\u2022 any ongoing large claims\n\n\tWhen a large broker or consultant controls a group insurance case, the broker or consultant designs the benefit plan in conjunction with the employer. In some cases, the business is placed with the existing insurance company or with a company that is either wanted by the employer or recommended by the broker or consultant. In other cases, bids are requested from several sources based on specifications prepared by the broker or consultant. In general, the bidding process is not open to every insurance company (or other provider of benefits) but is on an invitation basis. The decision about which insurance companies are invited to bid may be made at the discretion of the consultant or may be determined by the employer. For example, some employers may want bids only from companies headquartered in the same state.\n\n\tThe bidding specifications are accompanied by a cover letter that invites the insurance company to bid and states the last date on which bids may be received or postmarked. This date is usually from 45 to 90 days prior to the date coverage becomes effective. The specifications typically consist of a description of the plan desired, a census of employees, and any information the insurance company needs to properly underwrite and rate the case (see the previous list). Based on this data, the insurance company is asked to present a bid in the form of monthly and annual premiums for the coverage desired. In addition, a \"net cost illustration\" or \"retention exhibit\" is usually requested for a 2- to 5-year period. This illustration must show the projected premiums, incurred claims, retention, and dividends for each year, and it is often required to be based on assumptions listed in the specifications. The definitions of many of the preceding terms can vary.\n\n\tThe insurance company is typically confronted with a rigid set of specifications on which it must bid. However, some specifications are flexible and allow an insurance company to suggest changes in the specifications and to present a bid based on these suggestions. Furthermore, the specifications ask numerous questions about the insurance company's practices and ability to service the case. The following are only a few of the many questions that the specifications commonly contain:\n\n\t\t\u2022 How are incurred claims defined? \n\t\t\u2022 How is retention defined?\n\t\t\u2022 How is the level of reserves determined? \n\t\t\u2022 What is the interest rate credited to reserves?\n\t\t\u2022 How are catastrophic losses handled in the experience-rating process?\n\t\t\u2022 What charges are levied against the group's experience when coverage is converted?\n\t\t\u2022 For what period of time are rates guaranteed?\n\t\t\u2022 How much notice of rate changes is given at renewal? \n\t\t\u2022 What is the procedure for handling claims?\n\t\t\u2022 What services are provided in the area of cost containment?\n\t\t\u2022 If you are selected to provide coverage, on what date will the master contract and certificates of insurance be delivered?\n\t\t\u2022 Are there any additional costs for materials such as benefit booklets?\n\nChallenges with Managed Care Plans\n\n\tManaged care and the broad availability of varied medical expense plans and employer sponsorship of plan options often make proposal development especially challenging.\n\n\tPrior to managed care, an insurance company proposal could concentrate on coverage, benefits, and premium with a focus on its reputation for stability and prompt payment of claims. With the advent of managed care, proposals needed to address questions on the delivery of care under the managed care plan. Thus, the adequacy of the provider network, including its size, scope of services, and access became prominent issues. Quality, too, including the credentials of providers and the accreditation of the health plan overall by such organizations as NCQA, became paramount. All of these areas, along with performance measures, became plan selection criteria for employers and their employees.\n\n\tToday, few employers offer their employees only a single plan; many employers offer two or more options that allow employees to choose among traditional, HMO, POS, or PPO plans. Increasingly, these plans feature consumer-directed health plan funds that are associated with HRAs and/or HSAs.\n\n\tThus, insurers must carefully evaluate the underwriting implications and loss potential of employee selection among the options they offer based on differences in coverage, benefits, limitations on utilization and provider choice, and employee out-of-pocket payments. Such payments are determined not only by copayments, deductibles, and other self-responsible amounts, but also by the level of employer contribution to the premium of each option and the funding of consumer-directed health care accounts.\n\n\tA single insuring entity may offer all the options that an employer wishes to sponsor. If so, it eases the proposal burden of the insuring organization, whether a managed care organization or a traditional insurance company, to the extent that it is responsible for the group's total medical expenses. In this case, the insurer has a greater opportunity to recover losses due to adverse selection or other cost factors in one option through the positive experience under another or through overall premium adjustments for the overall account.\n\n\tHowever, in many cases, employers may select more than one company to offer the options. In such cases, the insurer must be particularly cautious about the plan features mentioned above that differentiate the available options and could create adverse selection against its options in favor of the options offered by another insurer, thereby making recovery of losses difficult.\n\nPresenting the Proposal\n\n\tThe successful presentation of a proposal leads to a sale that closes when the employer submits a signed application and the first periodic premium. For small groups, the agent, broker, or consultant makes the presentation of the proposal directly to the employer. In general, there is little room for negotiations, and the employer either accepts or rejects the initial proposal. In some cases, however, the proposal may contain two or three choices in plan design.\n\n\tFor large groups when the employer is dealt with directly, the agent, broker, or consultant may also present the proposal. However, because of the technical expertise necessary, the group representative is probably involved, and either presents the proposal or assists in its presentation. It is at this point that further negotiation on plan design and revision of the proposal are most likely to occur.\n\n\tWhen a large broker or consultant puts a group insurance case out to bid, there is usually no direct contact between the insurance company and the employer in the initial stages of the presentation. Rather, the group representative usually makes the presentation to the broker or consultant, who then evaluates all such proposals and makes a recommendation to the employer. This recommendation may be for the employer to select a specific proposal, but it often consists of presenting an employer with two or three proposals that best meet the employer's objectives. In this latter instance, the group representatives of the insurance companies involved are typically asked to meet with both the broker or consultant and the employer to further discuss the proposals. At this stage of the process, it is not unusual to give each company in contention a copy of the proposals that their competitors have submitted.\n\nEnrollment\n\n\tThe first step in the postsale activities of group marketing involves the enrollment of employees in the plan. If the plan is noncontributory, the employer must provide the insurance company with enrollment cards or a list of all employees to be covered and a certification that they have met all eligibility requirements, such as being actively at work or having satisfied a probationary period. If a plan is contributory, it must be properly marketed to the employees in order to encourage the maximum enrollment. In fact, unless the solicitation of employees is effective, the actual installation of the plan may never occur because of insufficient enrollment. Usually, the insurance company prepares the solicitation materials, such as letters or benefit booklets. For small employers, these may be standardized materials, but for large employers, they are custom designed. If a group is large enough, the insurance company may even prepare audiovisual presentations. Although the actual solicitation always involves the employer, it may consist only of the employer providing these materials to the employees. However, it is common for the employer to allow group meetings (during normal working hours) in which the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative can explain the plan to the employees and answer their questions.\n\n\tThe actual enrollment of employees either shortly follows or takes place simultaneously with the solicitation process. It consists of requesting the employees to complete enrollment forms supplied by the insurance company. These enrollment forms are usually brief, but they have more detail if the plan involves any individual underwriting of employees in addition to the usual group underwriting or if employees have a choice of alternative plans. Although the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative may conduct the actual enrollment, it is common for the employer's supervisory personnel to carry out this activity.\n\n\tAlthough proper marketing of a contributory plan to employees is crucial, a noncontributory plan must also be properly presented to employees if they are to fully understand and appreciate its provisions. In many cases, this means that the plan is presented to employees in virtually the same manner as if it were contributory.\n\nInstallation\n\n\tWhen the enrollment procedure is completed, the insurance company calculates the final premium rates and prepares the master contract (or joinder agreement in the case of a multiple-employer trust) and any other administrative materials for the employer as well as the certificates of insurance for the employees. The agent, broker, or consultant usually delivers these materials to small employers. In larger cases, the group representative, accompanied by the agent, broker, or consultant, usually performs the task. The agent, broker, consultant, or group representative thoroughly reviews the plan at this point with the employer and explains its administrative aspects, such as premium billings, claims procedures, and the enrollment and termination of employees. The importance of this meeting with the employer should not be ignored because the future success of a group insurance case is often a function of how well these administrative procedures are explained and thus understood by the employer.\n\n\tThe prominence of managed care plans makes the prompt and accurate performance of these installation procedures even more important. For example, enrollment (as well as termination of enrollment) may affect the payment of network providers, in particular those receiving capitation or incentive program payments per member. Premiums must also be collected promptly and accurately because such payments may have to be made in advance of the delivery of services to members. Network physicians unable to verify enrollment are unlikely to accept the plan's copayment amount from their patients, preferring instead to bill their usual charges for services.\n\nServicing the Case\n\n\tSimilarly, the importance of properly servicing a group insurance case cannot be overlooked. Good service not only increases the employer's satisfaction, but it also minimizes the possibility that the employer will transfer the case to another insurance company at the time of renewal. In addition, it may also lead to other business for the insurance company or the agent, broker, or consultant when the employer adds a new coverage or renews an existing coverage.\n\n\tThe process of servicing a case begins at the initial sale and continues throughout its life. The agent, broker, or consultant-often with the assistance of the group representative-usually conducts the servicing. However, some insurance companies have trained personnel whose sole function is to service group insurance cases, which allows the group representative to devote more of his or her time to sales activities. Most requests for service relate to routine administrative matters that involve billing, claims, or enrollment procedures. As previously mentioned, proper installation minimizes these requests. To discover whether there is any difficulty with a group insurance case at its earliest stage, the group representative must develop a close working relationship with other functional departments of the insurance company. For example, correspondence between the employer and claims personnel may be the first indication of any potential dissatisfaction.\n\n\tEven when no specific problems exist, the agent, broker, or consultant schedules periodic visits with the employer to discuss such items as the administration of the plan, claim trends, and new federal or state regulations that affect the plan. These visits may lead to suggestions that the employer make changes in the plan so that it better meets the employer's desires and needs.\n\n\tOne of the most important and possibly most difficult aspects of servicing a group insurance case occurs at the time of renewal, particularly if a rate increase is proposed (which is almost always the situation today for medical expense insurance). The shock of a large rate increase may be a catalyst that encourages an employer to seek out another insurance company. Therefore, it is important for the agent, broker, or consultant to keep the employer periodically informed of the group's experience and current trends so that the size of the increase is not unexpected. It is also at renewal time that the agent, broker, or consultant (often accompanied by the group representative) should thoroughly review the group insurance case to determine whether it is appropriate to make any changes. If the employer is considering changing insurance companies, the agent, broker, or consultant should emphasize any potential limitations of such an action. For example, the installation of a new plan will undoubtedly incur additional administrative costs. Furthermore, there may be the potential for some employees to lose benefits in the transfer because of differing provisions of the new insurance company's plan or the inability of an employee to immediately meet an actively-at-work requirement."

Employers and their advisers will need to discipline themselves to forgo overly complicated plan designs that seek to maximize every tax advantage, in order to keep the plan understandable and user-friendly for the majority of their employees. Communications programs, important in any employee benefit context, are especially critical for consumer-driven plans.\n           A successful CDHP requires that the employee not only understand the mechanics of the plan, but also be empowered to make informed and cost-effective personal health care decisions. CDHPs hold employees more accountable for their own health and health care expenditures. Consequently, most plans offer some form of a health coach to help employees navigate the health care system. The \"coach\" may be an assigned individual, especially in cases of chronic or severe illnesses, or simply a toll-free number staffed by health professionals to answer general questions. The coach's services may range from providing a list of specialists in the member's area to suggesting a list of questions to take along to the annual physical. Information about the plan, its covered benefits, and required procedures can also be available electronically at all times and from various portals.\n           The most effective communication and education campaigns reach out to employees early and often. While the initial communications are critical to employee acceptance and understanding, ongoing communications are important to achieving and sustaining the behavior changes needed to make CDHP cost savings objectives possible.\n"

Although variations within each type of plan exist, some generalizations can be made. The table below summarizes these. The degree of managed care increases as one moves from left to right in the table. However, the cost of the plans, on the average, decreases as the degree of managed care increases.

They come in two types: comprehensive and supplementary plans. The difference between the two is that comprehensive plans coinsure all covered medical expenses once the deductible is met, while supplementary plans coinsure all covered medical expenses (once the deductible is met) that are over and above those expenses covered by another plan.\n\nBoth types have high deductibles, co-insurance requirements, and a ceiling on the amount of benefits available during the plan year. However, both types of major medical insurance offer advantages over basic coverage health care plans:\n\u2022 Rather than covering only certain specified medical expenses, major medical plans cover almost all personal medical expenses whether the expense was incurred inside or outside of a hospital.\n\u2022 Major medical plans reimburse virtually all patients according to the same formula, regardless of the specialty of the physician, the location of the treatment, the drugs used, or the diagnostic techniques employed.\n\u2022 The maximum amount of benefits payable is considerably higher under a major medical plan than under a basic medical plan, particularly for physician and surgeon fees.\n\u2022 Having employees pay a deductible and co-insurance tends to keep them from making unnecessary visits to the doctor, which helps keep insurance costs down.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Developing a Health Care Strategy\n\nDEVELOPING A HEALTH CARE STRATEGY\n\n\tDeveloping a health care strategy for providing employee health and medical care benefits can be viewed as a program for managing risk exposures on a variety of levels. In its most elementary form, managing this risk involves a three-pronged strategy. First, the organization sponsoring the plan must decide what mode of health care delivery system will be used. Second, the organization must decide on the benefits that will be provided through the selected system. Third, the plan sponsor must decide what contractual, financial, or payment arrangement will be negotiated with insurers or providers of medical care. Negotiation of the financial arrangement also includes what level of risk is assumed by the plan sponsor and whether certain types or levels of risk will be shifted to a third party such as an insurer or the providers of the medical care itself. Increasingly, plan sponsors shift some of this risk to ensure that medical providers have a stake in providing cost-effective and quality care. All three of these macro decisions involve many other tiers of decisions at the micro level, which can have a profound impact on the levels of risk assumed and the financial costs assumed by the plan sponsor. With the advent of health care reform, additional risks have been entered into the system, since plan sponsors may be subject to providing subsidies or vouchers (see subsequent discussion in this chapter) to some of their employees and/or will be subject to certain excise taxes.\n\nDesigning the Plan and Delivery System\n\n\tThe plan sponsor is not only selecting one of the delivery systems discussed previously, but also has latitude to select various plan designs offered by alternate delivery systems or to include plan-specific provisions or procedures particular to the employer group. Unless federal or state law requires certain benefits, an employer quite often has flexibility to design its own schedule of benefits, assuming it is of sufficient size to gain this degree of customization by an insurer or managed care company. At times, even state insurance law is not an immovable constraint, because certain administrative service financing arrangements exempt plans from state insurance mandates. Limitations on specific coverages, uses of deductibles or copayments, and the systems for case management and precertification can profoundly impact both risk exposure and cost. The delivery system and plan design, its oversight, and financial incentives also can have behavioral impacts on plan participants influencing the utilization of health care services.\n\n\tWith the passage of major health care reform legislation in 2010, a new era began in structuring health benefit programs. Additional regulation at the federal level immediately impacted plan design decisions. For example, this is evident in the previously described distinction between grandfathered and non grandfathered plans. PPACA also distinguished between large and small employer plans. The Act included a tax credit for small employers that purchased health insurance for their employees when the employer\n\n\t\u25a0 Has fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees\n\t\u25a0 Pays average annual wages under $50,000\n\t\u25a0 Contributes a uniform percentage of at least 50 percent of the total premium cost\n\n\tThe full credit is available to employers with ten or fewer full-time equivalent employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000, and begins phasing out over those amounts. (Beginning in 2014, the credit is available only for qualified health plan coverage purchased through a health exchange, and employers may only receive the credit for a maximum of two consecutive years.)\n\nVarious insurance market reforms mandated by PPACA placed constraints on plan sponsor design decisions. For instance, six months after enactment, group health plans and health insurers were not allowed to\n\n\t\u25a0 Impose lifetime or annual limits on essential benefits (subject to certain exceptions).\n\t\u25a0 Rescind coverage unless there was fraud or misrepresentation by the enrollee.\n\t\u25a0 Drop coverage for adult children on their parents' coverage, regardless of the adult child's student or marital status, until the adult child turns 26 years old.\n\t\u25a0 Impose preexisting condition exclusions on enrollees under age 19.\n\nSelf-Administration, Third-Party Administrators, and Unbundled Services\n\n\tThe decision to purchase an assembled delivery system from an insurer or managed care company or to directly contract with providers is generally dependent on employer size and the geographic concentrations of an organization's employees. When an employer is of sufficient size, it might want to deal directly with medical providers and eliminate the costs associated with the intermediary insurer. Even if an employer does not want to assume the burden of self-administration, it is not necessary to purchase all medical care management services through a single provider. An employer can decide to unbundle specific services that might be more effectively performed by separate entities or purchase an integrated set of services or programs through one provider. Moving specific, specialized functions to third-party vendors with special expertise in one area can sometimes address certain goals. At the very least, an employer should understand the costs of these services if they are left bundled with the insurer and review claims and other reports to evaluate the services' effectiveness and contributions to cost control.\n\n\tUnder PPACA, by 2014, certain employers' employees gain access to health insurance through health exchanges. PPACA requires each state to establish one or more health exchanges in which small employers and individuals can purchase health insurance. Initially, only small employers have access to purchase group health insurance through an exchange. However, by 2017, states may permit large employers to purchase group health coverage through their exchanges. States have the right to define \"small\" and \"large\" employers before 2016, though small employers generally will not exceed 100 employees. Lawful United States' residents (except incarcer\u00ad ated individuals) generally can access individual health coverage through an exchange in a state in which they live.\n\nUse of Multiple Plan Offerings and Single or Multiple Administrators\n\n\tMedical care delivery systems and benefit design are not an \"all-or\u00ad nothing\" decision for many large employers. Though some employers place their entire block of business with a single insurer or managed care company, many other employers have configured a variety of health plan alternatives and give employees the choice of selecting the health plan that best meets their individual needs. This can be accomplished through a simple choice of medical plan options or through a flexible benefit plan. In large part because of limited dollars available to expand benefit programs and a recognition that a diverse workforce may have varying benefit needs, flexible benefit programs proliferated in the 1980s. In a flex plan, employees are allocated a set amount generally in the form of credits or dollars from the employer, which they can \"spend\" to select the benefits and plan options of their choice or receive those credits in the form of cash if not spent on benefits. Nevertheless, many managed care companies and insurers offer employers an array of multiple plan designs. Price concessions are often offered if an employer agrees to place the entire block of business with a single administrative entity. An employer must balance the price concessions it will receive and assess the effectiveness of the administrative entity at managing health care costs against the loss of competition that occurs when multiple plan offerings through various administrators are eliminated.\n\nPricing Plan Options and Designing Employer Subsidies\n\n\tRegardless of whether multiple administrators or a single administrator are used for separate plan offerings, the plan sponsor must look at the pricing of plan options and make decisions regarding the form and amount of employer subsidy provided to employees. An employer offering a flexible benefit program may price various plan options at prevailing market rates, assign all employees an equal credit amount, and allow them to spend the credits as they prefer. Other employers provide a direct subsidy to their medical plans and only show employees the remaining employee costs they will be required to pay. Some employers subsidize family contracts to a greater extent than single coverage. The employer must also decide how to relate the subsidy to each medical plan option. Plan pricing will affect employee selection patterns. Premiums are impacted by the level of deductibles and co-payments that have been included in the front-end plan design. Accordingly, an employer can determine whether plan costs and certain benefits are being borne by those utilizing those particular benefits or are being spread over the employee group at large.\n\nMore transparency and analysis on pricing plan options emerged in the wake of PPACA's passage. The Act imposed penalties, effective 2014, on employers with an average of 50 or more employees who\n\n\t\u25a0 Offer inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage or do not offer minimum essential coverage; or\n\t\u25a0 Have at least one full-time employee who qualifies for federal premium assistance for coverage through an exchange\n\nThe penalty varies depending on whether the employer fails to offer minimum essential coverage or offers inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage. Effective 2018, employers who provide health benefits deemed to be too generous will also be assessed penalties. An employer sponsoring a so-called \"Cadillac\" group health plan is required to pay a 40 percent excise tax on the excess value of the coverage.\n\nThe Effects of Multiple Plan Offerings on Employee Selection Patterns and Pricing\n\n\tThe offering of multiple benefit offerings can create an exodus of favorable risks from existing offerings and result in price escalations for those who choose to stay with a previously offered plan. In some cases, the offering of a new plan at favorable pricing can cause such dramatic migration out of a plan that the remaining plan will experience a price spiral that causes termination of the plan. This was particularly true in the mid-1980s for many employers who offered traditional indemnity plans. The offering of either a less expensive comprehensive plan or an HMO resulted in those employees with low utilization for major services migrating to the less costly plans, seeking to reduce their expenditures on monthly health care premiums. With this loss of favorable risks, the indemnity plan retained less favorable risks with higher utilization patterns. Because there was a smaller pool of favorable risks in the plan over which to spread plan costs, the premiums charged to those who remained increased. This increase in plan costs resulted in another wave of more favorable risks choosing to leave the plan rather than bear the increased costs of the plan. Again costs increased, giving further incentive for favorable risks to migrate from the plan. Ultimately, a cost spiral like this will cause a plan to become prohibitively expensive and result in its demise.\n\n\tAs the provisions of PPACA are phased in, employers will need to be vigilant regarding the effects that alternative access to coverage through health exchanges have on their employee selection patterns and pricing. Effective 2014, employers that pay for any portion of health coverage and offer minimum essential coverage are required to supply \"free choice vouchers\" to qualified employees to purchase qualified health coverage through an exchange. A qualified employee eligible for free choice vouch\u00ad ers has the following characteristics:\n\n\t\u25a0 His or her required contribution for minimum essential coverage through the employer's plan exceed 8 percent but is less than 9.8 percent of the employee's annual household income.\n\t\u25a0 His or her household income does not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\t\u25a0 He or she does not participate in an employer-sponsored health plan.\n\n\tThe value of the free choice voucher is the most generous amount that the employer would have contributed under the firm's plan for self-only coverage or, if relevant, family coverage. Employers are required to pay this sum to an exchange. Subsequently, the exchange credits the amount towards the monthly premium for the plan selected by the employee. When the free choice voucher amount exceeds the exchange plan premium, the difference is refunded to the employee and is subject to taxation. Employers may deduct the amount paid in vouchers and are not assessed the employer mandate penalty for employees receiving vouchers.\n\nDesigning the Underwriting and Financial Arrangements\n\n\tAs indicated in the discussion of alternative financing techniques, an employer can dramatically alter the financial arrangement of its medical benefits program by determining the amount of risk it will accept. The strategic issue is to select a financial arrangement that controls costs and allows management to assume the level of risk that it believes appropriate for its employee group. The financial arrangement selected can have a behavioral impact on both the providers managing care and the insurer or administrator responsible for management of the plan. Increasingly, employers have explored arrangements that shift more risk to health care providers and that promote incentives to provide quality care. Much research, is being done on measuring quality of care and developing information systems that can be used to evaluate cost and quality of care.\n\n\tThe financial strategy for a medical benefits program will have multiple tiers. This is particularly true if multiple plan options are available and employees choose between plan offerings. Plan pricing and plan offerings can alter enrollment patterns and affect the effectiveness of a given financial arrangement or risk-management strategy.\n\n\tDetermining cost-effective medical providers and health plans is not an easy exercise. Certain plans will attract employees from certain demographic and geographic constituencies because of plan benefits or the convenience of provider locations. Health care costs are directly correlated with age, in that older individuals tend to need more care and need to access more extensive and thus more expensive care. Likewise, there can be regional differences in the cost of medical care. Sometimes, base premium costs or allocated costs per participant are not the best indicator of cost-effective medical care. Analyzing plan costs by adjusting for demographic, geographic, and other variables in the plan population is the best way to evaluate the cost efficiency.\n\nMeasuring Performance and Managing the Plan\n\n\tA final attribute of health care strategy is to create a system of monitoring and measuring the attainment of plan objectives. It is also important to have a system of controls that ensures that the plan is being effectively managed. A well-developed plan design is of little use if a third-party administrator is unable to administer the design as it was intended. A system for auditing plan results, ensuring quality outcomes, and reporting utilization is necessary. For this reason, any delegation of responsibilities for health plan management should involve negotiation on the management reporting responsibilities of the administrator and the performance standards it is expected to achieve. Assigning financial penalties or providing rewards associated with these performance standards can be very effective. For instance, with a traditional insured product, a plan sponsor can require claims payment within a certain number of days for a percent of the claims. With a managed care provider operating a staff model HMO, reporting could be required on the telephone systems for contacting PCPs. There could be performance criteria on the amount of time it takes to reach a physician by phone, and scheduling standards for the amount of time between the initial call and an available appointment.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Provider Networks\n\nprovider network\t\n         Networks of providers of health care services and the contracts that establish them are essential to managed care plans. These plans manage care primarily through the provider network that members in the plan are encouraged to use. Members may be required to receive covered medical care services from network providers only, or they must use these providers in order to obtain full plan benefits. To be successful, a managed care plan must create and maintain provider networks that do the following:\n\u2022 contain qualified providers of health care services\n\u2022 meet member needs for medical care services\n\u2022 compensate network providers in a manner that encourages efficient use of resources\n\n\nQualified Providers of Health Care Services\ncredentials\t\n          Managed care plans specify the qualifications, known as credentials, that providers must have and maintain to be a network participant. Physicians, for example, must document their training, licensure, certification in a specialty, and malpractice insurance coverage. In addition, they must be free of limitations, suspensions, or impairments that would affect their practice of medicine and hospital admitting privileges. Hospitals and other institutions must be licensed, accredited, and approved for participation in the Medicare program. Generally, a credentialing verification organization hired by the managed care plan obtains the information to determine if a provider has the qualifications that the plan requires. The plan repeats the credentialing process periodically to make sure that network providers continue to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMember Needs for Medical Care Services\n           A managed care plan's provider network must encompass the broad scope of health services that members may need and be conveniently accessible to those members.\n\n           Network providers include physicians, hospitals and other institutions, diagnostic radiology and laboratory services, and therapy services. Among the other institutions in a network are facilities that provide outpatient care, including surgery, rehabilitation, and skilled-nursing care. Although a few managed care plans may hire their health care professionals and own their facilities, most managed care plans establish their networks through contracts with providers. These providers may be solo practitioners or participate in various types of groups under a variety of organizational structures. A provider often participates in several networks and also treats patients who are not members of managed care plans. Plans may also contract with specialty care organizations for specific services. These services may include psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, radiology, laboratory and pathology services, transplant surgeries, and prescription drug services.\n\n             Networks need to allow members to have reasonably convenient access to the broad range of services that the managed care plan offers. Therefore, managed care plans must develop and maintain sufficient numbers and types of providers to meet member health care needs in a geographic area. In addition, most network physicians must remain open to accepting as patients those members who are new to the plan as well as those who may wish to change providers. As a result, most plans maintain active recruitment and management programs to make sure that their networks keep pace with the needs of their ever-changing member populations in the areas and regions where these members reside. However, competition for members frequently requires managed care plans to expand their networks to offer members a choice of physicians, specialists, and hospitals beyond that required by scope of service and convenience alone.\n\nProvider Compensation\n             A major objective of managed care plans is cost containment through the efficient use of health care resources. The method of provider compensation is one major component of this objective.\n\n             Providers are willing to grant preferred rates to managed care plans because as participants in the plan's network they anticipate an increased number of patients who will utilize their services. Or conversely, they will not lose patients to providers who are network providers. The specific payment method for network providers varies by the type of provider and the negotiating strength of the plan. However, the managed care plan's objective remains the same under any payment arrangement: to control the price of services and the overall increase in the cost of services utilized.\n\n             The compensation for services is determined by agreement in advance of the provision of services and a plan cannot change it for a specified period without notification. It also usually requires the agreement of each party. An important part of the contract with a provider outlines the provider's obligation to accept the agreed-upon amount as payment in full, except for copayments and other clearly identified amounts which the provider must collect from plan members.\n\n              The payment method also intends, if possible, to have providers participate to some degree in the increased cost of services utilized either through incentive payments for meeting utilization targets or penalties for failure to do so. The payment methods managed care plans use include capitation, modification of the traditional fee-for-service payment system, and per-day and per-case rates.\n\n\nCapitation\ncapitation\t\t\n              Although far from dominant, the payment method historically associated with managed care plans is capitation. HMOs frequently employ this method for the payment of primary care physicians if each HMO member is required to select or is assigned a primary care physician who is responsible for the member's care. Primary care physicians provide members with basic health care services and coordinate additional care needs through referrals to other network physicians for certain medical specialist services. Under capitation, these physicians receive a fixed payment per month for each member without regard to the services a member may receive in any particular month. These rates reflect likely utilization of services by the plan's members based on age and gender and the cost of care in the area. Capitation provides physicians no financial incentives to overtreat patients.\n\n\nincentive payment program\nwithhold arrangement\n              In conjunction with capitation, a managed care plan commonly establishes an incentive payment program that rewards physicians who meet budgeted cost and utilization levels for hospital and ancillary services. This program may include other criteria such as meeting member satisfaction and quality standards. Such an incentive program is called a withhold arrangement if it imposes financial penalties or decreases compensation for failure to meet these same criteria.\n\n              HMOs may also use capitation in some cases for the payment of specialty physicians and services such as substance abuse care and chronic condition management. Although infrequent, payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services may also use capitation.\n\n\nModified Fee-For-Service Payments\nmodifiedfee-for-service payment system\n              Despite the cost containment advantages of capitation,\na modified fee-for-service payment system is the dominant method for compensating physicians in managed care plans. Many specialty physicians in managed care plans and most physicians in PPO networks receive payment in this manner. Managed care organizations also occasionally used it with hospitals.\n\n               With this method of compensation, the plan pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, subject to negotiated maximums per procedure. In most cases, this involves a discount from what the physician would charge a patient who did not participate in the managed care plan.\n\n               Modified fee-for-service payment arrangements employed by managed care plans often include some element of physician financial involvement in cost containment through rewards or penalties based on success in achieving the plan's utilization and cost targets. These rewards and penalties are similar to the incentive and withhold arrangements discussed previously under capitation payment.\n\n\nPer-Day and Per-Case Payments\nper-day rate\n                The dominant arrangement used by managed care plans for payment of inpatient hospital services is a negotiated per-day rate. With this approach, a plan pays a hospital a specified amount for each day a plan member is hospitalized, regardless of the actual cost of services on any particular day. The rate usually differs by type or level of care such as intensive care, obstetrics, or rehabilitation. The rate may decrease in relation to the days the member stays in the hospital or the aggregate days of stay for all plan members.\n\nper-case rate\ndiagnosis-related groups\n                 A managed care plan may be able to control costs more effectively by using a per-case rate to pay for hospital stays. With this approach, the plan pays a specified fee for all inpatient costs, regardless of a member's length of stay. This fee is based on such factors as a member's principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, gender, and presence of complications. This system of classification of services is often referred to as diagnosis-related groups.\n\n                 Managed care plans also often use a per-case rate to reimburse hospitals and other providers for nonphysician services that members receive on an outpatient basis.\n"

Like an HMO, the insurance company negotiates discounts with physicians and the hospitals and adds them to its \"network\" of providers. Employees enrolled in a PPO plan are encouraged to choose doctors and hospitals from the network. Employees who do choose providers from withing the network usually pay a set amount per office visit (typically $10 to $30) with the insurance company paying the rest.\n\n                        Unlike an HMO, PPO networks are generally smaller and you can see a specialist without having to see a Primary Care Physician (PCP) first. Also, you can see a physician outside of the network and you'll probably have your cost covered (although likely at a lower rate than for in-network physicians). However, premiums are usually higher than in HMOs and it's usual to have a deductible amount you have to meet each plan year before coverage kicks in.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 9 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Evaluating Quality\n         Let us assume that an employer is convinced of the importance and feasibility of considering quality in health care purchasing. How should it go about assessing quality or promoting employee evaluation of quality, whether at the level of the physician, hospital, ancillary services provider, or health plan?\n\nPhysician Quality\n         Most assessments of physician quality begin with the physician's training, experience, and professional certifications. The literature on the link between these factors and quality is limited. Nevertheless, these characteristics can serve as a starting point for evaluating a physician's level of knowledge and skills, which we might postulate would be related to the appropriateness and excellence of his or her practices. In addition, a review of physician credentials might reveal that small proportion of physicians for whom glaring quality-of-care problems have been identified. Characteristics to consider in this assessment include the following:\n\u25a0 Current unrestricted license to practice in your state\n\u25a0 Current unrestricted license to dispense prescription drugs from the state and the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration\n\u25a0 Certification by a specialty board recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties\n\u25a0 Current active, unrestricted hospital staff privileges\n\n        The last of these criteria may not apply to physicians who choose not to see patients in a hospital setting. It may be difficult, however, to determine if a physician's privileges were dropped as a result of his or her own choice or because of a quality-driven decision by the hospital. The advantages of using a physician with hospital privileges include having continuity of both inpatient and outpatient care and having the benefit of the hospital's QA and/or CQI program apply to your physician. This latter benefit includes hospital access to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a national database on physician quality problems that is not accessible to the public. (Referernce 30 below)\n\n        Conspicuously absent from the above list is malpractice experience. There are questions about the extent to which malpractice experience is a reflection of physician quality. (Reference 32 below) On the other hand, research indicates that any history of malpractice claims, paid or unpaid, is associated with an increased likelihood of future claims. (Reference 32 below) Therefore, it may be worth evaluating a physician's malpractice claim history, if only to reduce your risk of being involved in a future malpractice claim. Medical malpractice claims closed within the past five years in 17 states, including California, Florida, New York, and Texas, can be found through the \"Background Check\" tab available from HealthGrades under find-a-doctor search at www.health\u00ad grades.com. Additional malpractice claim information on individual physicians may be available from the court clerk in the jurisdiction(s) where the physician has practiced.\n\n        A physician's credentials can be evaluated directly by employees, by benefit managers, or by health plans. The following are some of the resources for employees and benefit managers to consider in conducting such an evaluation:\n\u25a0 American Board of Medical Specialties (www.abms.org)\n\u25a0 American Medical Association (www.ama-assn.org)\n\u25a0 HealthGrades (www.healthgrades.com)\n\u25a0 Federation of State Medical Boards (www.docinfo.org)\n\n       The state physician licensing board is a good place to look for answers to questions about the state licensing status of individual physicians. Most states have such information available online. A review of information available from state licensing boards has been assembled by Public Citizen Health Research Group and can be found at www.citizen. org/hrg. Physician sanctions and disciplinary actions by state licensing boards for all 50 states can also be found through the \"Background Check\" tab available from HealthGrades under find-a-doctor search at www.healthgrades.com.\n\n       The quality-related issues described above pertain to all physicians, regardless of their specialty. When assessing physician quality as it relates to specific diagnoses or conditions, additional factors should be considered. For example, physicians being evaluated for their quality in performing a particular surgical procedure should be asked such questions as these:\n\n\u25a0 What kind of advanced training and/or certification has the physician had in performing the procedure?\n\u25a0 What is the annual volume of the procedure performed by the physician?\n\u25a0 What are the complication and mortality rates for the procedure as performed by the physician?\n\u25a0 What is the success rate for the procedure as performed by the physician?\n\u25a0 What is the average length of hospital stay for the procedure?\n\u25a0 What is the average length of disability following the procedure?\n\n        The applicability of these and other questions will vary by specialty, condition, and procedure. Generally speaking, however, the quality of a physician's performance, as in the example of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty described above, is related to the frequency with which he or she performs the procedure. For some conditions and procedures, there may be regional or national research centers or centers of excellence. Helpful resources in learning about such centers, and obtaining consumer information about various health issues include the following:\n\u25a0 National Cancer Institute, Cancer Information Service (Tel. 800-4-CANCER)\n\u25a0 American Cancer Society local affiliates (see local phone book)\n\u25a0 American Heart Association local affiliates (see local phone book)\n\u25a0 American Lung Association local affiliates (see local phone book)\n\u25a0 National Institute of Mental Health (Tel. 800-421-4211)\n\n        The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), in collaboration with the American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, and American Diabetes Association, has developed programs to recognize physicians demonstrating that they provide high-quality care for patients with selected common chronic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, cardiac conditions, and stroke. Information about these programs and a data\u00adbase of recognized physicians is available at www.bridgestoexcellence.org. The NCQA is promoting use of Bridges To Excellence recognition by employers and health plans to select and reward physicians.\n\n        Another important aspect of the quality of primary care physicians is the responsibility they take for providing for all the health care needs of their patients. This responsibility has been formalized in the concept of a patient-centered medical home (PCMH). The American College of Physicians, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Osteopathic Association have jointly defined the medical home as a model of care where each patient has an ongoing relationship with a personal physician who leads a team that takes collective responsibility for patient care. The physician-led care team is responsible for providing all the patient's health care needs and, when needed, arranges for appropriate care with other qualified physicians. Functional elements of a PCMH include enhanced access and communication, patient tracking, care management, electronic prescribing, test and referral tracking, and performance reporting and improvement. The PCMH is founded upon research demonstrating the benefits to quality of primary care and the Chronic Care Model. (Reference 33 below) NCQA has established a program to recognize primary care physician practices as medical homes: Physician Practice Connections-Patient-Centered.Medical Home. NCQA has been working with national and regional health plans to promote the PCMH concept and encourage its adoption by physicians through the use of incentive payments. (Reference 34 below) Ask your primary care physician if he or she has been recognized as a PCMH through a health plan or NCQA.\n\n         If your physician participates in any managed care programs, he or she may receive periodic performance report cards from the MCO and may be willing to share the results with you. Some of these results may be published. For example, the Pacific Business Group on Health has published performance data on medical groups that make up California health plans (though the data are not broken out by individual physician).\n\n         Physician report card data are publicly available for selected locations and specialties. For example, the Pennsylvania Health care cost Containment Council has published heart attack mortality data for physician groups. (Reference 35 below) More recently, the Society of Thoracic Surgery has made available comparative data on clinical quality for 221 cardiac surgical groups from 42 states in Consumer Reports and at www.sts.org. The data identifies groups as above average, average, or below average for quality of treatment, complication and survival rates.(Reference 36 below)\n\n        While \"report cards\" on physicians promise to be increasingly available, they should be interpreted with caution. A number of potential pitfalls with such reports have been identified. For example, multiple physicians may participate in a patient's care, making it difficult to assign primary responsibility for the patient's outcome to any one physician or medical group. (Reference 37 below) In a study of physician report cards for diabetes care, Hofer and colleagues found that they were unable to reliably detect true practice differences among physicians at three practice sites. They also found that physicians could easily \"game\" the reporting system by avoiding or deselecting patients with high prior cost or with poor adherence or poor response to treatment. (Reference 38 below)\n\n        Another public source of information about physician quality is patients. A growing number of organizations publish patient-reported ratings of physician quality. While these ratings are based upon patient perceptions only, they present a vitally important aspect of physician quality. HealthGrades offers such patient ratings information at www.healthgrades.com, as does Angie's List at www.angieslist.com. A 2010 study identified 33 physician-rating Web sites offering 190 reviews on 27 percent of 300 randomly chosen Boston physicians. (Reference 39 below) While these Web sites appear to address a minority of physicians with relatively few patient raters today, they are likely to become more robust in their coverage and inputs with the continued growth of social networking on the web.\n\n        An influential force for improving physician-specific quality data is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI). Under the 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act (TRHCA), CMS created an incentive payment for eligible health professionals who report data on standard quality measures for outpatient services provided to Medicare Part B beneficiaries. (Reference 40 below) PQRI quality measures include vaccinations, screening mammograms, diabetes management, and body mass index (BMI) screening and follow up, to name a few. Eligible professionals who satisfactorily report these quality measures for 2010, for example, earn an incentive payment of 2 percent of their total estimated Medicare Part B allowed charges during the same reporting period. CMS periodically sends eligible professionals feedback reports on their performance. Beginning in 2015, failure to report PQRI measures will result in reductions in payments to eligible professionals under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA). While these data are not yet public, the PPACA requires an Independent Payment Advisory Board to produce an annual report on quality of care, including regional comparisons of provider practice patterns and costs. (Reference 41 below)\n\n       Finally, there is a large body of research suggesting that physician\u00adpatient communication is related to the quality and outcome of care. Perhaps the best way to evaluate a physician's communication skills is to do so firsthand, scheduling an office visit to get to know a physician you may not already be familiar with. If you make such a visit, it may be helpful to prepare both general questions and questions particular to your circumstances in advance of your appointment.\n       Investigating even this minimum set of criteria for physician quality care requires a significant investment of time and resources. And such assessments should be repeated periodically to ensure that there has been no change in physician status. The extensive nature of this undertaking points to one advantage of purchasing medical care from a health plan that includes a network of providers. The various aspects of physician quality described above and others can be consistently and rigorously assessed by the plan on an ongoing basis, with associated economies of scale.\n\n\nHospital Quality\n       Some of the same approaches to quality assessment described for physicians can be applied to hospitals. A useful starting place for assessing a hospital's quality is its accreditation. Accreditations to look for include the following:\n\u25a0 Current, unrestricted license from the state\n\u25a0 Current, unrestricted, nonprobationary accreditation from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for participation in Medicare and Medicaid\n\u25a0 Current, unrestricted, nonprobationary accreditation from the Joint Commission\n\n      The Joint Commission has an extensive process for assessing hospital quality with unannounced on-site surveys. (Reference 42 below) Beginning January 1, 1995, the Joint Commission made available summaries of the results of its new surveys. (Reference 43 below) These summaries, however, are brief and offer only general information. In addition, the Joint Commission's surveys were at one time criticized by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as \"unlikely to detect patterns, systems, or incidents of substandard care.\" (Reference 44 below) Among the improvements implemented by the Joint Commission in an effort to address these concerns are the inclu\u00ad sion of outcomes measures in its review process, such as acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and complications of surgery.\n      \n       General information on hospital facilities, personnel, and services are published annually by the American Hospital Association. (Reference 45 below) This information can sometimes be helpful in making inferences about quality for particular conditions or procedures. For example, if you are having a high-risk delivery, you may wish to choose a hospital that has an advanced\u00adlevel nursery, including a dedicated neonatal intensive care unit. One variable to consider in assessing hospital quality is whether it is a major teaching hospital (defined as more than 0.097 teaching residents per hospital bed set up and staffed for patient care). Such hospitals have been found to have a lower risk of death than other hospitals, when evaluated for mortality due to hip fracture, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure. (Reference 46 below) A review of 23 studies comparing quality of care in teaching hospitals as compared with nonteaching hospitals found better performance in teaching hospitals over a range of locations, conditions, and populations. (Reference 47 below)\n\n       The Leapfrog Group is an organization of large purchasers of health care that strives to create big leaps in health care safety, quality and value. The group gathers data voluntarily reported by hospitals on standards of safety, quality, and value. Ratings of hospital conformance to Leapfrog standards are published on their Web site at www.leapfroggroup.org.\n       The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services makes data publicly available on hospital performance through its Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files. In some states (e.g., Pennsylvania and New York), data are publicly available on hospital performance for specific conditions and procedures. (Reference 48 below) These data can include the volume of cases, outcomes (mortality and complication rates), average length of stay, and average cost per case. HealthGrades is an organization that analyzes and reports hospital quality rating information at www.healthgrades.com. The HealthGrades quality rating system relies on publicly available Medicare data and a statistical model for risk adjustment to assess hospital mortality and complications by diagnosis and procedure. A study of the ability of HealthGrades ratings to discriminate between individual hospitals in the processes and outcomes of their care was published by a team of researchers at Yale University. They found that Health Grades ratings could accurately identify groups of hospitals that performed better in quality than other hospital groups. HealthGrades ratings did poorly, however, when it came to discriminating between two individual hospitals on their processes of care or mortality performance. (Reference 49 below)\n\nCMS also makes hospital quality data available on its Web site at www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov. These data include the following:\n1. Process-of-care quality measures such as timely use of antibiotics for all surgery patients, and control of blood sugar and prevention of blood clots for selected surgery patients\n2. Outcome-of-care measures such as death rate for pneumonia patients and readmission rate for heart attack patients\n3. Use of medical imaging such as overuse of outpatient combination (double) CT scans of the chest or abdomen when a single scan may be more appropriate\n4. Survey of patients' hospital experiences and ratings of quality\n5. Medicare payment and volume data by condition and procedure\n\n      The Commonwealth Fund has further analyzed these measures to permit comparisons of performance for one or more hospitals to national and state averages and top 1 percent, 10 percent, or 25 percent of hospitals. This information can be found at their Web site at www.whynotthebest.org.\n      Whether or not data are publicly available for the condition or procedure of interest to a particular patient, he or she may wish to consider approaching the hospital administration directly with the following questions:\n\n\u25a0 What is the hospital's volume of admissions for the condition or procedure of interest?\n\u25a0 What is the mortality or complication rate for the condition or procedure as performed at the hospital?\n\u25a0 What is the success rate for the treatment or procedure at the hospital?\n\u25a0 What is the average length of stay for the condition or procedure?\n\u25a0 Does the hospital participate in any managed care networks (e.g., HMO, PPO, or POS plans)?\n\u25a0 Has the hospital been designated as a center of excellence for the condition or procedure by a health plan?\n\n     The final question will apply to only a small number of conditions, procedures, and hospitals. Nevertheless, one can find designated regional and national centers of excellence for high-risk, high-cost conditions and procedures, such as organ transplantation, open-heart surgery, and burns. The National Institutes of Health also designates research centers for selected conditions. One might postulate that these centers are more likely to provide quality care for these conditions because of their successful research programs.\n\n     The question pertaining to volume of patients admitted for a particular condition or procedure can be extremely useful as a surrogate measure of quality. More than 20 years of research and dozens of published studies have linked better outcomes to hospitals and doctors delivering higher volumes of particular health care services. (Reference 50 below) Research has confirmed the link of high volume to better outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (hospitals with more than 6.3 Medicare patients with acute myocardial infarction per week on average), major cancer surgery (hospitals with more than one Medicare patient per year on average for a given procedure), and carotid endarterectomy, i.e., surgery removing blockages from the carotid arteries to prevent stroke (hospitals with more than 62 Medicare patients undergoing the procedure per year). (Reference 51 below) Yet, volume is not a perfect surrogate for quality. A study of coronary artery bypass surgery in 164 hospitals found that higher-volume surgeons and hospitals had lower mortality and read\u00ad mission rates. Low-volume hospitals that consistently provided patients with proven elements of care, however, had mortality and readmission rates no different than high-volume hospitals. (Reference 52 below)\n\nAdditional resources to consider when evaluating hospital quality include the following:\n\u25a0\tAmerican Hospital Association, Chicago (www.aha.org)\n\u25a0\tCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Baltimore, MD (www.cms.hhs.gov)\n\u25a0\tThe Joint Commission, Oakbrook Terrace, IL (www. jointcommission.org)\n\n      Assessing hospital quality, both initially and on an ongoing basis, can be a labor-intensive process. As in the case of physician quality assessment, this kind of assessment and more should be obtainable with economies of scale through a quality health plan offering a provider network (see below).\n\nManaged Care Organization Quality\n      One of the great potential advantages of purchasing health care through a managed care organization is the cost-effective ongoing quality assurance and continuous quality improvement that these plans can provide. Research has demonstrated the contribution of health plans to variations in quality of care. (Reference 53 below) The question for the employer or purchaser of an MCO is how to evaluate the quality and the contribution of its supplier's QA/CQI programs. One approach to this question is to look for accreditation by an independent organization that has evaluated the quality of the MCO. Today, the major accrediting organization for MCOs is the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA).\n     The NCQA has reviewed a majority of MCOs in the United States.(Reference 54 below)\nIts accreditation process involves a review of MCO quality-related systems, including quality improvement, processes for reviewing and authorizing medical care, quality of provider network, and members' rights and responsibilities. (Reference 55 below) Documentation of these processes provided by the MCO are analyzed, and a site survey is conducted involving both physician and administrative reviewers.\n     In addition to its process-oriented assessments, the NCQA has developed the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to help standardize the measurement and reporting of health-plan performance. Higher performance on HEDIS measures has been linked to better physical and mental health outcomes in health-plan enrollees with diabetes. (Reference 56 below) HEDIS measures have become the basis of performance measures produced by many health plans and purchasing coalitions. (Reference 57 below) HEDIS has measures applicable to commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare plans. In the area of effectiveness of care, the measures include such items as breast cancer screening, controlling high blood pressure, and follow-up after hospitalization for mental illness. In the area of access and availability of care, measures include getting needed care and getting care quickly. In the area of satisfaction, HEDIS incorporates the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) instrument-a reliable and valid survey and reporting kit developed by a consortium of the Harvard Medical School, the RAND Corporation, and the Research Triangle Institute under the sponsorship of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. (Reference 58 below) Based upon these reviews, and MCO performance on HEDIS and CAHPS, the MCO is granted one of the following levels of accreditation status: (Reference 59 below)\n\n\u25a0 Excellent-Demonstrated performance that meets or exceeds NCQA requirements for consumer protection and quality improvement (QI), and HEDIS results among the highest scoring plans nationally or regionally\n\u25a0 Commendable-demonstrated performance that meets or exceeds NCQA requirements for consumer protection and QI\n\u25a0 Accredited-performance meeting most of NCQA's requirements for consumer protection and QI\n\u25a0 Provisional-compliance with some, but not all, of NCQA's consumer protection and QI requirements\n\u25a0 Denied-failure to meet NCQA requirements for consumer protection and QI requirements\n\n      The performance of health plans can be compared using accredita\u00ad tion level and HEDIS measures. Individual plan performance and performance benchmarks can be accessed through NCQA's Health Plan Report Cards and Quality Compass program (see www.ncqa.org). Report cards include ratings of health-plan performance on access and service, qualified providers, staying healthy, getting better, and living with illness. NCQA has also created an economic model for projecting the comparative performance of health plans. The Quality Dividend Calculator projects cost savings that an individual employer can expect from choosing a high\u00adquality MCO. Projections are based upon how health care quality as measured by HEDIS reduces absenteeism and increases productivity among employees. The calculator is also available through the NCQA Web site. It should be noted that not all health plans collect and publish HEDIS data, and although NCQA audits HEDIS data, the data are collected and analyzed by the health plans themselves, with the potential for bias that is inherent in this approach.\n\nIn assessing health-plan quality of care, it would be worthwhile to ask the following questions of health plan administrators:\n\u25a0 Has your MCO applied for accreditation from the NCQA?\n\u25a0 If so, when was your most recent review, and what category of accreditation did your MCO receive?\n\u25a0 Will the MCO provide a summary of the findings of the accreditation process?\n\n      A list of health plans reviewed by NCQA for accreditation is available online at www.ncqa.org. While reviewing the results of these accreditation processes can be informative, the accreditation organizations explicitly warn that they do not warranty any third parties (e.g., employers) regarding the quality of care of an MCO. In addition, many MCOs have not yet undergone accreditation. Therefore, whenever an employer or employee is purchasing MCO services, it would be advisable to do some additional evaluation, including contacting your state departments of insurance and/or public health, reviewing some minimal documentation related to MCO quality, and making a site visit.\n\n     State governments generally have some regulatory authority over MCOs operating within their borders. This regulatory authority may reside with the department of public health, the department of insurance, or some combination of these. A call to one or both of these agencies in your state, asking for information about the status of a particular MCO, can be informative. If the MCO of interest is an HMO, you may want to ask for a copy of the HMO's annual report, which must be filed with the state department of insurance.\n     \nRequesting and reviewing the following information from the MCO also can be helpful:\n\u25a0 Credentialing criteria and processes for network physicians, hospitals, and ancillary providers (e.g., laboratory, X-ray, and home health agencies): Do these criteria and processes include those mentioned above under physician and hospital quality? Are provider credentials verified by the MCO, or do they accept a provider's self-report? How frequently are providers recredentialed? Does the recredentialing process include routine, systematic consideration of member complaints, member satisfaction, and other quality indicators?\n\u25a0 A copy of the most recent quality assurance, quality management, or CQI plan and annual report (individual provider and patient identifiers can be removed to protect confidentiality): Does the plan include reliable and valid measures and standards of appropriateness of care, excellence in care, and satisfaction\nwith care as described above? Are providers educated about these measures and standards? Are performance measures documented and routinely fed back to providers? Is meaningful reinforcement and support provided for performance improvement? Are there credible, specific documented examples of performance improvement over the preceding year?\n\u25a0 Routine provider quality profiles (i.e., sample reports on provider performance routinely analyzed by the MCO): How reliable, valid, and useful to quality improvement are the data contained in the reports? To what extent has the quality performance monitoring described in the quality assurance plan been incorporated into MCO reporting systems?\n\u25a0 Reimbursement formula for physicians in the MCO: Are there substantial financial incentives for physicians to withhold necessary care? Conversely, are there substantial financial incentives for physicians to provide quality care? (It has been this author's observation that MCOs providing such financial incentives are more likely to have reliable and valid measures of physician quality and systems for monitoring and feedback of these measures.)\n\u25a0 Preventive care programs offered and participation rates: What preventive care programs does the MCO offer, at what location, and with what frequency? What member cost sharing, if any, is required? What are the participation and success rates for these programs?\n\u25a0 Plan-wide measures of quality: Will the MCO provide the most recent report of performance using HEDIS measures? Did it use survey instruments recommended in HEDIS for assessing member satisfaction and health status? If not, how did it ensure the reliability and validity of the instruments? What were the response rates to these surveys?\n\nAn additional step that can be immensely helpful in assessing the quality of an MCO is to conduct a brief site visit to \"kick the tires.\" In this author's experience, it is not uncommon to come away from such a visit with an entirely different assessment of MCO quality than is conveyed in written material from the organization. Consultants with some knowledge of managed care can be helpful but are not necessary. For a site visit to be most helpful, the following guidelines are recommended:\n\u25a0 Allow four to eight hours for the visit.\n\u25a0 Try to limit the time devoted to marketing and formal presentations.\n\u25a0 Arrange to meet key staff, including the medical director and the heads of member services, quality assurance, utilization management, and finance. What is their relevant training and experience? Are they credible and involved? What is their level of commitment?\n\u25a0 Devote the most time on site to direct observation and questioning of MCO operations staff, and listening to staff on the telephone in member services, claims administration, and utilization management. What is their relevant training and experience? What is their level of commitment? What is the quality of their customer service? Do they document members' complaints, concerns, and questions, and follow up? Do you see signs of a pervasive CQI program with posted performance standards and measures?\n\u25a0 Discuss quality-related information provided prior to the site visit (see above). What are the processes for collection and quality control of data? What were the most successful improvement initiatives in the preceding year? Review minutes of the most recent quality assurance committee meetings.\n\u25a0 Assess the philosophy of the MCO. Is it a good fit with your own and that of your organization? Is the MCO interested in you as a customer, your quality concerns, and your business needs?\nPatient, member, and/or physician confidentiality should not be a barrier to conducting a site visit as long as reviewers are willing to sign confidentiality agreements.\n\n       For larger employers, all of the above elements can be incorporated into a formal competitive bid process involving multiple MCOs. A nationwide health plan evaluation program has been produced by the National Business Coalition on Health and endorsed by Bridges To Excellence and the Leapfrog Group. This program-eValue8-is a collaborative effort by employer coalitions around the nation to share data comparing health plan performance. More information about this program can be found at www. nbch.org.\n\nOther resources to consider when evaluating MCO quality include the following:\n\u25a0 National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), Washington, DC (www.ncqa.org)\n\u25a0 America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), Washington, DC (www.ahip.org)\n\u25a0 Institute for Health Care Improvement (IHI), Roxbury, MA (www.ihi.org)\n\u25a0 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Baltimore, MD (www.cms.hhs.gov)\n\u25a0 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Rockville, MD (www.ahrq.gov)\n      Evaluating MCO quality, like physician and hospital quality assess\u00ad ment, can be a time-consuming process. Yet, this may be a relatively small investment of time when weighed against the resources spent by employer and employee on health care and the risks posed by the purchase of poor\u00ad quality health care.\n\n\n\nREFERENCE\n\n30.

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Provider Networks\n\nprovider network\t\n         Networks of providers of health care services and the contracts that establish them are essential to managed care plans. These plans manage care primarily through the provider network that members in the plan are encouraged to use. Members may be required to receive covered medical care services from network providers only, or they must use these providers in order to obtain full plan benefits. To be successful, a managed care plan must create and maintain provider networks that do the following:\n\u2022 contain qualified providers of health care services\n\u2022 meet member needs for medical care services\n\u2022 compensate network providers in a manner that encourages efficient use of resources\n\n\nQualified Providers of Health Care Services\ncredentials\t\n          Managed care plans specify the qualifications, known as credentials, that providers must have and maintain to be a network participant. Physicians, for example, must document their training, licensure, certification in a specialty, and malpractice insurance coverage. In addition, they must be free of limitations, suspensions, or impairments that would affect their practice of medicine and hospital admitting privileges. Hospitals and other institutions must be licensed, accredited, and approved for participation in the Medicare program. Generally, a credentialing verification organization hired by the managed care plan obtains the information to determine if a provider has the qualifications that the plan requires. The plan repeats the credentialing process periodically to make sure that network providers continue to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMember Needs for Medical Care Services\n           A managed care plan's provider network must encompass the broad scope of health services that members may need and be conveniently accessible to those members.\n\n           Network providers include physicians, hospitals and other institutions, diagnostic radiology and laboratory services, and therapy services. Among the other institutions in a network are facilities that provide outpatient care, including surgery, rehabilitation, and skilled-nursing care. Although a few managed care plans may hire their health care professionals and own their facilities, most managed care plans establish their networks through contracts with providers. These providers may be solo practitioners or participate in various types of groups under a variety of organizational structures. A provider often participates in several networks and also treats patients who are not members of managed care plans. Plans may also contract with specialty care organizations for specific services. These services may include psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, radiology, laboratory and pathology services, transplant surgeries, and prescription drug services.\n\n             Networks need to allow members to have reasonably convenient access to the broad range of services that the managed care plan offers. Therefore, managed care plans must develop and maintain sufficient numbers and types of providers to meet member health care needs in a geographic area. In addition, most network physicians must remain open to accepting as patients those members who are new to the plan as well as those who may wish to change providers. As a result, most plans maintain active recruitment and management programs to make sure that their networks keep pace with the needs of their ever-changing member populations in the areas and regions where these members reside. However, competition for members frequently requires managed care plans to expand their networks to offer members a choice of physicians, specialists, and hospitals beyond that required by scope of service and convenience alone.\n\nProvider Compensation\n             A major objective of managed care plans is cost containment through the efficient use of health care resources. The method of provider compensation is one major component of this objective.\n\n             Providers are willing to grant preferred rates to managed care plans because as participants in the plan's network they anticipate an increased number of patients who will utilize their services. Or conversely, they will not lose patients to providers who are network providers. The specific payment method for network providers varies by the type of provider and the negotiating strength of the plan. However, the managed care plan's objective remains the same under any payment arrangement: to control the price of services and the overall increase in the cost of services utilized.\n\n             The compensation for services is determined by agreement in advance of the provision of services and a plan cannot change it for a specified period without notification. It also usually requires the agreement of each party. An important part of the contract with a provider outlines the provider's obligation to accept the agreed-upon amount as payment in full, except for copayments and other clearly identified amounts which the provider must collect from plan members.\n\n              The payment method also intends, if possible, to have providers participate to some degree in the increased cost of services utilized either through incentive payments for meeting utilization targets or penalties for failure to do so. The payment methods managed care plans use include capitation, modification of the traditional fee-for-service payment system, and per-day and per-case rates.\n\n\nCapitation\ncapitation\t\t\n              Although far from dominant, the payment method historically associated with managed care plans is capitation. HMOs frequently employ this method for the payment of primary care physicians if each HMO member is required to select or is assigned a primary care physician who is responsible for the member's care. Primary care physicians provide members with basic health care services and coordinate additional care needs through referrals to other network physicians for certain medical specialist services. Under capitation, these physicians receive a fixed payment per month for each member without regard to the services a member may receive in any particular month. These rates reflect likely utilization of services by the plan's members based on age and gender and the cost of care in the area. Capitation provides physicians no financial incentives to overtreat patients.\n\n\nincentive payment program\nwithhold arrangement\n              In conjunction with capitation, a managed care plan commonly establishes an incentive payment program that rewards physicians who meet budgeted cost and utilization levels for hospital and ancillary services. This program may include other criteria such as meeting member satisfaction and quality standards. Such an incentive program is called a withhold arrangement if it imposes financial penalties or decreases compensation for failure to meet these same criteria.\n\n              HMOs may also use capitation in some cases for the payment of specialty physicians and services such as substance abuse care and chronic condition management. Although infrequent, payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services may also use capitation.\n\n\nModified Fee-For-Service Payments\nmodifiedfee-for-service payment system\n              Despite the cost containment advantages of capitation,\na modified fee-for-service payment system is the dominant method for compensating physicians in managed care plans. Many specialty physicians in managed care plans and most physicians in PPO networks receive payment in this manner. Managed care organizations also occasionally used it with hospitals.\n\n               With this method of compensation, the plan pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, subject to negotiated maximums per procedure. In most cases, this involves a discount from what the physician would charge a patient who did not participate in the managed care plan.\n\n               Modified fee-for-service payment arrangements employed by managed care plans often include some element of physician financial involvement in cost containment through rewards or penalties based on success in achieving the plan's utilization and cost targets. These rewards and penalties are similar to the incentive and withhold arrangements discussed previously under capitation payment.\n\n\nPer-Day and Per-Case Payments\nper-day rate\n                The dominant arrangement used by managed care plans for payment of inpatient hospital services is a negotiated per-day rate. With this approach, a plan pays a hospital a specified amount for each day a plan member is hospitalized, regardless of the actual cost of services on any particular day. The rate usually differs by type or level of care such as intensive care, obstetrics, or rehabilitation. The rate may decrease in relation to the days the member stays in the hospital or the aggregate days of stay for all plan members.\n\nper-case rate\ndiagnosis-related groups\n                 A managed care plan may be able to control costs more effectively by using a per-case rate to pay for hospital stays. With this approach, the plan pays a specified fee for all inpatient costs, regardless of a member's length of stay. This fee is based on such factors as a member's principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, gender, and presence of complications. This system of classification of services is often referred to as diagnosis-related groups.\n\n                 Managed care plans also often use a per-case rate to reimburse hospitals and other providers for nonphysician services that members receive on an outpatient basis.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Preferred-Provider Organizations\n\n\tA concept that continues to receive considerable attention from employers and insurance companies is the preferred-provider organization. A few PPOs existed on a small scale for many years, but since the early 1980s PPOs have grown steadily in number and in membership. Today, PPOs provide coverage for medical expenses to more Americans than do HMOs, primarily because of the flexibility of covered persons to choose their own medical providers.\n\nWhat Is a PPO?\npreferred-provider organization (PPO)\n\tThe term preferred-provider organization (PPO) tends to be used in two ways. One way is to apply it to health care providers that contract with employers, insurance companies, union trust funds, third-party administrators, or others to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. Using this definition, a PPO may be organized by the providers themselves or by other organizations, such as insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, or employers. Like HMOs, they may take the form of group practices or separate individual practices. They may provide a broad array of medical services, including physicians' services, hospital care, laboratory costs, and home health care, or they may be limited only to hospitalization or physicians' services. Some of these organizations are very specialized and provide specific services, such as dental care, mental health benefits, substance abuse services, maternity care, or prescription drugs. This book refers to these providers not as PPOs but as preferred providers or network providers.\n\tThe second use of the term PPO, and the one generally assumed when the term is used throughout this book, is to apply it to benefit plans that contract with preferred providers to obtain lower-cost care for plan members. PPOs typically differ from HMOs in several respects. First, the PPO generally pays the preferred providers on a fee-for-service basis as their services are used. However, fees are usually subject to a schedule that is the same for all similar providers within the provider network, and providers may have an incentive to control utilization through bonus arrangements. Second, employees and their dependents are not required to use the practitioners or facilities that contract with the PPO; rather, they can make a choice each time medical care is needed, and the PPO also pays benefits for care provided that nonnetwork providers furnish. However, employees have incentives to use network providers; they include lower or reduced deductibles and copayments as well as increased benefits, such as preventive health care. Third, most PPOs do not use a primary care physician as a gatekeeper; employees do not need referrals to see specialists.\n\tEmployers were disappointed with some of the early PPOs. Although discounts were available to members, they seemed to have little effect on benefit costs because discounts were from higher-than-average fees, or providers were more likely to perform diagnostic tests or prolong hospital stays to generate additional fees to compensate for the discounts. These PPOs seldom lasted long. Successful PPOs today emphasize quality care and utilization review. In selecting physicians and hospitals, PPOs look both at the type of care provided and the provider's cost effectiveness. In this era of fierce competition among medical care providers, these physicians and hospitals are often willing to accept discounts in hopes of increasing patient volume. It is also important for a PPO to monitor and control utilization on an ongoing basis and to deal with groups of preferred providers that monitor their own costs and utilization. Generally, however, PPOs do not monitor their preferred providers as closely as HMOs do.\n\nVariations\n\tOver time, PPOs have continued to evolve. A few PPOs compensate providers on a capitation basis, and a few others perform a gatekeeper function. If a member's primary care physician does not recommend a specialist, PPO benefits may be reduced. With these changes, it is sometimes difficult to determine the exact form of a managed care organization. However, those that operate as traditional HMOs generally provide medical expense coverage at a slightly lower cost than do those that operate as traditional PPOs, but there are wide variations among HMOs as well as among PPOs. Therefore, a careful analysis of quality of care, cost, and financial stability is necessary before the selection of a particular HMO or PPO.\n\nexclusive-provider organization (EPO)\n\tAnother variation of the PPO is the exclusive-provider organization, or EPO. The primary difference is that an EPO does not provide coverage outside the preferred-provider network, except in emergencies and those infrequent cases when the network does not contain an appropriate specialist. This aspect of an EPO makes it very similar to an HMO. The number of EPOs is small.\n\nSponsorship\n\tInsurance companies and the Blues established most of the early PPOs to provide products to compete with HMOs. In the early part of this decade, the number of PPOs grew significantly to over 1,000. However, primarily because of mergers, the number has decreased. The majority are still owned by insurance companies and the Blues. Some are owned by HMOs to give them another product in their health plan portfolios to offer employers. Others have a variety of ownership forms, including third-party administrators, private investors, and groups of physicians and/or hospitals.\n\nBenefit Structure\ncenters of excellence\n\tThe basic benefit structure of a PPO is very similar to that of the traditional comprehensive major medical contract. The most significant difference is that there is a higher level of benefits for care received from network providers than there is for care received from nonnetwork providers. Many PPOs have extensive networks of preferred providers, particularly in the geographic areas in which they operate, and there is little reason to seek care outside the network. Some of these PPOs also have reciprocity agreements elsewhere with networks of other PPOs and hospitals (called centers of excellence) that have excellent outcomes and reputations for certain types of medical procedures, such as cancer treatment, organ transplants, or burn treatment. Under these agreements, the PPO pays benefits as if a member receives care from network providers. Other PPOs have more limited networks, and the need and desire for treatment from nonnetwork providers is greater.\n\tThe level of benefits under PPOs may vary because of differences in deductibles, coinsurance, and precertification rules. There may also be a few additional benefits that are available only if a member receives care from a network provider. Finally, the procedures for filing claims also differ. The major purpose of these differences is to encourage an employee or dependent to receive care from preferred providers who agree to charge the plan a discounted fee.\n\nDeductibles\n\tA PPO may have annual deductibles that apply separately to network and nonnetwork charges. For examples, these might be $500 and $1,000, respectively. However, some PPOs have no deductible for network charges. A PPO may waive deductibles for some medical services, such as emergency services.\n\nCoinsurance\n\tPPOs often use coinsurance percentages that are 20 percent (and occasionally 30 percent) lower when a member receives care from nonnetwork providers. A frequently found provision applies 90 percent coinsurance to network charges and 70 percent coinsurance to nonnetwork charges. Coinsurance provisions of 100/80, 90/80, 100/70, and 80/60 are also commonly used. As with deductibles, a PPO may waive the percentage participation for certain medical services. In addition, different stop-loss limits or coinsurance caps, such as $1,000 and $3,000, may apply to network and nonnetwork charges.\n\tAlthough PPOs typically have higher coinsurance percentages for network charges than do traditional major medical plans, a covered person may be responsible for copayments in some circumstances. For example, there might be a copayment, typically ranging from $10 to $25, for each a visit to a primary care physician.\n\nallowable charge\n\tIn evaluating PPOs, it is important to determine the basis the PPO uses to apply the coinsurance percentage. For example, assume a plan uses 80 percent coinsurance for nonnetwork charges and that a charge of $100 is incurred for a medical procedure from a nonnetwork provider. Most PPOs first determine whether this charge is usual, customary, and reasonable. If it is, the plan pays $80. If the plan determines that the usual, customary, and reasonable charge is $90, it will be 80 percent of that amount, or $72. However, some plans apply the coinsurance percentage to what they often refer to as an allowable charge. In most cases, this is the amount that the PPO pays to network providers for the same procedure. In some cases, network discounts are quite large and, for example, the allowable charge in this example might be only $60. For a nonnetwork charge, the plan pays 80 percent of this amount, or $48. Thus the insured has an out-of-pocket expense of $52. Few employees and their families will seek nonnetwork care under this type of plan. For this reason, plans that pay nonnetwork charges on this basis are sometimes referred to as phantom PPOs.\n\nPrecertification Rules\n\tPPOs often have precertification requirements for many types of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, and medical supplies. For network benefits, the person responsible for obtaining the needed certification is the network provider, and the PPO does not penalize a member if the network provider fails to obtain the proper precertification. (This becomes an issue between the PPO and the provider.) However, this responsibility shifts to the employee or family member for nonnetwork services. If he or she does not obtain a required precertification, there usually is a reduction in benefits. For example, what was once 80 percent coinsurance might shrink to 60 percent.\n\nAdditional Network Benefits\n\tFor the most part, PPOs pay benefits for the same medical procedures, whether a network or a nonnetwork provider performs them. However, some PPOs cover a few procedures only if a member receives them from network providers.\n\nClaims\n\tNo claim forms are required for network services. The covered person merely pays any required copayment, and the provider of medical services does the paperwork needed to receive the additional amounts payable by the plan. Just as in traditional major medical plans, it is the ultimate responsibility of the covered person to file the claims forms necessary to receive benefits for nonnetwork care. Of course, the provider may do much of the paperwork and accept an assignment of benefits.\n\nExample\nThe following table shows excerpts of the benefit structure from a sample PPO.\n\nTable 9-2 Selected Benefits under a Sample PPO\n\tNetwork Benefit\tNonnetwork Benefit\nDeductible\tNone\t$500 per person per year. Family deductible equals 2 times the individual deductible. The deductible does not apply to emergency care or preventive\nservices.\nCoinsurance\t100% for most services\t70% for most services\nOut-of-pocket Limit\tNone\t$2,000\nLifetime Maximum\tUnlimited\tUnlimited\nHospital Services\t100% with a $250 copayment\nper hospitalization\t70% with a $500 copayment per\nadmission\nEmergency Room\t100% with $50 copayment\nper visit\t100% with $50 copayment per visit\nSurgical Services\t100%\t70%\nOutpatient Diagnostic Services\t100%\t70%\nCardiac Rehabilitation Therapy\n(limit 18 sessions per benefit period)\t100% with $15 copayment per session\t70%\nPsychiatric Services\t\t\nInpatient\t100%\t70%\n\t100% for 9 visits with $10\t\nOutpatient\tcopayment; $20 copayment\t\n\tthereafter\t50%\nOutpatient Diabetic Education\t100%\t70%\nPhysician Service\t100% with $20 copayment\nper visit for primary care physicians; $30 copayment for specialists\t70%\nPrescription Drugs\t100% with $10 copayment\nfor generic drugs and $20 for nongeneric drugs\t50%\n\nRegulation\n\tPPOs initially were subject to much less stringent regulation than HMOs with respect to their managed care activities. In fact, they were largely unregulated. As a result, the NAIC created the Preferred Provider Arrangements Model Act, which the majority of states adopted. The act is relatively brief and establishes only a minimal regulatory framework. The act requires that PPOs incorporate cost-containment mechanisms, such as utilization review, to determine whether a service is medically necessary. Covered persons must have reasonable access to medical services. The act also allows PPOs to provide incentives for persons to use the preferred-provider network and to place limitations on the number and types of providers with whom they contract.\n\tNote that most PPO contracts also meet the definition of insurance and are subject to the same regulation by state insurance departments as traditional insurance contracts with respect to contract provisions and benefit mandates.\n\n\n \n"

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider.

With an HMO, an insurance company or managed care company contracts with general practitioners, specialists, and hospitals to provide health care for the members it insures. The members, in tum, have to choose a general practitioner (or Primary Care Physician) from the list of doctors who have contracted with the HMO and they have to go through their PCP for any medical treatment they need. If members go to a doctor outside the HMO network they won't be covered by insurance unless it's a life-threatening emergency.\n\n                        Employees insured by the HMO will normally have to make only a small co-payment (about $20) when they visit their doctor as long as they go to their primary care physician for treatment and for referrals to specialists and hospitals approved by the HMO. The major drawbacks of an HMO are strict rules and lack of free choice in physicians and medical facilities. However, HMOs offer a broad range of services and a choice of coverage and co\u00adpayment levels.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2930 - Family Leave - Family and Medical Leave Act - Employee Obligations Under FMLA\n\n\tEmployees have some obligations under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). In general, employees must:\n\u25a1 provide at least 30 days' notice before a foreseeable leave begins;\n\u25a1 upon an employer's request, provide certification from a health care provider of the need for leave relating to a serious health condition; and\n\u25a1 upon an employer's periodic request, provide a notice of intent to return to work once the leave period expires.\n\tPointer: Exactly what constitutes \"sufficient notice\" by an employee under the FMLA varies widely, from court to court.\n \nForeseeable leave\n\tEmployees must give their employers 30 days' notice before taking unpaid FMLA leave for the birth or placement of a child or for planned medical treatment when the need for the leave is foreseeable.\n\tWhen providing this advance notice is not practical (for example, a premature birth), it must be given as soon as practicable, ordinarily within one or two business days of when the employee learns of the need for the leave.\n\tVerbal notice sufficient to inform the employer that the employee will be needing FMLA leave satisfies the FMLA's notice requirements. However, the notice must describe the reasons for the leave in enough detail to make it evident that the leave qualifies as FMLA leave.\n\tPointer: When planning medical treatments, employees should consult with employers when giving notice and make reasonable efforts to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the employer's operations (Reference 1 below).\n\tConsequences of failing to give advance notice. If an employee fails to give timely advance notice when the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employer may deny the taking of FMLA leave until 30 days after the date the employee provides notice to the employer of the need for FMLA leave  (Reference 2 below).\n\nMedical certification\n\tEmployers may require that employee requests for medical leave (either for themselves or to care for a family member with a serious health condition) be supported by a certification issued by a health care provider and provided to the employer in a timely manner (Reference 3 below). The employee must provide this certification within 15 calendar days of the leave request in all cases of FMLA leave, including foreseeable leave. Pursuant to the final rules, employers have five business days in which to request medical certification after receiving notice of an employee's need for FMLA leave. Employees must be provided additional time to provide certification, or to cure any defects in their certification, if the employee is unable to comply with the 15-day time frame despite diligent efforts (Reference 4 below). Employers may require annual medical certification where an employee's serious health condition extends beyond a single year.\n\tCaution: Employers cannot impose more strenuous requirements than the FMLA imposes for employees taking family leave. For example, an employer cannot require an employee to bring a certification from a health care provider within one week because FMLA imposes a 15-calendar day rule.\n\tRequired information. A certification is considered sufficient if it includes the following information (Reference 5 below):\n\u25a1 date on which the serious health condition began;\n\u25a1 probable duration;\n\u25a1 appropriate medical facts;\n\u25a1 estimate of amount of time needed;\n\u25a1 statement that the eligible employee is needed to care for the family member or that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee's position;\n\u25a1 dates and duration of planned medical treatment for a request for intermittent or reduced schedule leave;\n\u25a1 medical necessity for leave and duration, in the case of an employee's serious health condition, for a request for intermittent or reduced schedule leave; and\n\u25a1 necessity of the employee's assistance and duration of leave for a request for intermittent or reduced schedule leave in the case of the serious health condition of an employee's family member.\n\tIn addition, employees must provide a written translation of any medical certification that is completed in any language other than English.\n\tDiagnosis may not be required. Provisions describing the information necessary for a complete certification allow that while a health care provider may provide a diagnosis, employers may not require that a diagnosis be provided as part of the certification. In addition, an employer may require that the medical certification specify whether an employee is able to perform the essential functions of the employee's job. The employer may provide a list of essential job functions when it requires such certification. Moreover, certification for intermittent or reduced leave must include information confirming that such leave is medically necessary. Employers also may require the health care provider's specialization to be included in the certification.\n\tPointer: An employer is allowed, under the final rules, to contact an employee's health care provider directly in order to obtain information required for certification. However, an employee's direct supervisor is banned from making such contact. Moreover, an employee may not be required to provide an authorization, release, or waiver permitting the employer to contact their health care provider directly. Any contact with health care providers must conform to the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule (Reference 6 below).\n\tSecond opinion. If the employer doubts the validity of a medical certification, it may require the eligible employee to obtain a second opinion concerning the leave from a second health care provider designated by the employer, but the employer must pay for the second opinion (Reference 7 below). The second health care provider may not be employed on a regular basis by the employer (Reference 8 below).\n\tThird opinion. If the second opinion conflicts with the medical certification, the employer may require and pay for a third opinion from a third health care provider designated and approved by both the employer and eligible employee. The third opinion is final and binding on both the employer and the employee (Reference 9 below).\n\tRecertification. An employer may request medical recertification no more than once every 30 days. However, recertification may occur more frequently if (Reference 10 below):\n1. the employee requests an extension of leave;\n2. the circumstances described by the original certification have changed significantly; or\n3. the employer receives information that casts doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification.\n\tAn employer is allowed to request recertification of an ongoing condition every six months. Such recertification applies to conditions where the minimum duration of the condition exceeds 30 days. In instances of long-term serious health conditions, the rules expressly allow an employer to provide the health care provider with information about the employee's record of absences to inquire whether such absences are consistent with the serious health condition in question.\n\tAn employer may require an employee who is on FMLA leave due to his or her own serious health condition to provide a new medical certification, not just a recertification, for the employee's first FMLA absence in a new 12-month leave year for the same qualifying serious health condition (Reference 11 below).\n\tFailure to provide certification. If an employee fails to provide a requested medical certification in a timely manner, an employer may deny FMLA leave until the employee submits the certification. The final rules expressly state the employee's burden to provide complete and sufficient certification (Reference 12 below).\nEmployers are not required to notify employees if medical certification has not been received. However, if an employer receives a certification that is deficient or incomplete, the employer must notify the employee in writing and explain what additional information is necessary to perfect certification. Employees are to be given seven days in which to provide the additional information.\n\nPeriodic notice of intent to return to work\n\tEmployees on FMLA leave may be required to report periodically on their status and intention to return to work.\n\tPointer: If an employee wants to return to work earlier than planned, reasonable notice (i.e., within two business days) needs to be provided where foreseeable.\n\tFitness-for-duty certification. Employees have the same obligation to pro\u00ad vide certification of fitness-for-duty upon return to work following FMLA leave as upon initial certification for leave. Employers may require that the certification specifically confirm that the employee is able to perform the essential functions of the employee's job. However, the employer must inform the employee that it will require fitness-for-duty certification at the time it notifies the employee that it is designating the employee's leave as FMLA leave. If the employer wants the certification to confirm that the employee is able to perform the essential functions of the employee's job, it must provide the employee with a list of the essential job functions upon giving designation notice as well. If reasonable job safety concerns exist, and if uniformly applied to all leaves, an employer may require a fitness-for\u00adduty certification before an employee returns to work after taking intermittent FMLA eave.\n\tIf an employee unequivocally advises the employer that he or she does not intend to return to work, the employment relationship is considered terminated, and the employee's entitlement to reinstatement, continued leave, and health benefits ends (Reference 13 below).\n\tCaution: Employers should be extremely careful when an employee says that he or she is not returning to work. An employee must indicate this intention in language that is absolutely clear and subject to no possible misunderstanding. For example, if an employee says \"I don't think that I'll be able to come back to work but I'll sure try,\" there may be room for doubt that the employee will not return to work.\n\n\nFor more information...\n\tA sample form that employers may use in obtaining medical certification is located at KB-1 Topic 251,365 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 FMLA Act Sec. 102(e) and 29 CFR \u00a7 825.302 and 825.303.\n2 29 CFR \u00a7 825.304.\n3 FMLA Act Sec. 103(a) and 29 CFR \u00a7 825.305.\n4 29 CFR \u00a7 825.305.\n5 FMLA Act Sec. 103(b) and 29 CFR \u00a7 825.306.\n6 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 825.306, 825.307.\n7 FMLA Act Sec.103(c).\n8 FMLA Act Sec. 103(c)(2).\n9 FMLA Act Sec. 104(d)(1) and (2).\n10 FMLA Act Sec. 104(e) and 29 CFR \u00a7 825.308.\n11 DOL Opinion Letter FMLA 2005-2-A.\n12 29 CFR \u00a7 825.313.\n13 29 CFR \u00a7 825.311.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 8 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Understanding Behavioral Health Care Benefits - Future Developments in Behavioral Health Care\n          While many Americans need mental health treatment, only about 36 per\u00ad cent of American adults with mental disorders are receiving treatment. (Reference 16 below) \n          Some of the reasons for this are cost, lack of insurance, stigma, and not understanding what behavioral insurance covers. Although the stigma associated with mental health care is fading, some individuals are still concerned that employers, coworkers, or friends will think less of them for seeing a therapist. Others are skeptical that therapy is effective and actually solves problems. And some people simply cannot find, or do not know how to find, a therapist who works well with them.\n          The costs for not accessing needed behavioral treatment are many. Depression can complicate a patient's recovery from a major illness. Patients with chronic or serious mental illnesses who do not have appropriate outpatient care can bounce in and out of inpatient facilities, while families and patients suffer from poor outcomes and mounting insurance bills. Finally, lack of care can lead to the most serious outcome possible: death of the patient through suicide.\n\nBroadening Care Access\n         Radical new approaches to reaching those in need of mental health care are needed-and fortunately, are either in development or in use already. They include the following:\n\u25a0 Proactive disease management programs that operate on several fronts: working with employers to reach out to employees through the workplace, and with health plans to identify patients taking psychotropic medications who need additional support; and reaching out to patients with other diseases such as diabetes or cardiac conditions who may also suffer from mental illness.\n\u25a0 Outreach to people who want treatment but do not know how to access it or to find a therapist who is best for them. One's choice of a psychotherapist is primarily impacted by a physician's recommendation, the health plan network, and the location of the clinician's office. Offering information about clinicians online, even identifying those within a network with specializations or a track record of producing the best outcomes, can help people make more informed choices. Just as health plans publish physician \"report cards\" to educate consumers, so psychotherapist report cards might help people choose the best therapist for their needs.\n\u25a0 New ways of delivering therapy that are more accessible and cost effective. For example, patients with mild to moderate levels of distress can benefit from a \"coach\" who offers counseling over the telephone or via the Internet. The Internet can also play an important role in promoting compliance with treatment, and augment other treatment offerings.\n\nProductivity\n         One of the challenges facing managed behavioral health care organizations is the ability to demonstrate to purchasers that the benefits they deliver result in increased workplace productivity. Studies of this type are usually collaborative efforts between an employer group and MBHO, and results are often skewed by nuances of the individual group. In 2003, PacifiCare Behavioral Health, a leading national managed behavioral health care organization, reported the results of a four-year study of nearly 20,000 of its members in behavioral treatment representing multiple employer groups and health plans across the country. By measuring the degree of work impairment through a patient survey tool administered in clinicians' offices at the beginning and at multiple points during psychotherapy, the MBHO was able to track patient improvement. Five questions on the survey assessed degrees of work impairment. The MBHO found that 31 percent of people accessing behavioral services met criteria for being work-impaired-meaning their day-to-day functioning was impaired. After only three weeks of treatment, the percentage of work-impaired patients dropped to 18 percent, and after nine weeks, it dropped to 15 percent. Generally, patients who still appear work-impaired after a few months of treatment are those with chronic behavioral health conditions that need more intensive services with careful monitoring and typically are enrolled in a disease management program.\n\n\nREFERENCE\n\n16.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 400 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Mental Health Benefits\n\n    Most states require insurers to provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment. Most larger employers offer mental health coverage, but on a more restrictive basis than for other conditions.\n    As is true for substance abuse treatment (see KB-1 Topic 405), coverage for mental health treatment often carries specific limits for:\n\u25a1 days of care per year and lifetime;\n\u25a1 dollars to be reimbursed;\n\u25a1 number of hospital stays per year and on a lifetime basis;\n\u25a1 number of outpatient visits per year and on a lifetime basis; and\n\u25a1 annual or lifetime limits on total mental health benefits provided.\n    Pointer: EAPs (see KB-1 Topic 1100) can help employers to reduce mental health care costs.\n\nMental health parity\n    Under the federal Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), health plans that have lifetime or annual limits on what the plans will spend for medical or surgical services must either include services for mental illness in their total limit or maintain a separate limit for mental illness that is no more restrictive than the medical/surgical limit (Reference 1 below).\n    The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), as set forth in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) adds financial requirements and treatment limitations to the existing mental health parity provisions and expressly adds substance use disorder to the coverage of the parity provisions (Reference 2 below). Group plans that provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits must apply the financial requirements for both benefits equally. Financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance addiction should not be more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to other health benefits and there should be no separate cost sharing requirements or treatment limitations applicable only to mental health or substance addiction benefits.\n    Financial requirement and treatment limitation. \"Financial requirement\" includes deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket expenses, but excludes the existing aggregate lifetime limit and an annual limit under the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA and PHSA. A financial requirement or treatment limit is considered \"predominant\" if it is the most common of such type of limit or requirement. \"Treatment limitation\" includes limits on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment (Reference 3 below). \n    The general parity requirement prohibits a plan (or health insurance coverage) from applying any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the \"predominant\" financial requirement or treatment limitation applied to \"substantially all\" medical/surgical benefits in the same classification. The general parity requirement applies separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation (that is, for example, copayments are compared to copayments, and deductibles to deductibles) (Reference 4 below).\n    The parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations are applied on a classification-by-classification basis. There are six exclusive classifications used for purposes of satisfying the parity requirements: inpatient, in\u00adnetwork; inpatient, out-of-network; outpatient, in-network; outpatient, out-of-net\u00adwork; emergency care; and prescription drugs. If a plan provides any benefits for a mental health condition or substance use disorder, benefits must be provided in each classification for which any medical/surgical benefits are provided (Reference 5 below).\n    The portion of plan payments subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (such as day limits, visit limits, frequency of treatment limits) is based on the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the plan for the plan year. Any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under the plan for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.\n    The first step in applying the general parity requirement is to determine whether a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to \"substantially all\" medical/surgical benefits in a classification. A financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification if it applies to at least two-thirds of the benefits in that classification. If a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of the medical surgical benefits, that type of requirement or limitation cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits (Reference 6 below).\n    The Labor Department (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the IRS have provided further clarification by specifically stating that the criteria for making medical necessity determinations, as well as any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in developing the underlying nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTL) and in applying it, must be disclosed with respect to both mental health and substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits, regardless of any assertions as to the proprietary nature or commercial value of the information (Reference 7 below).\n    In addition, although not required to do so, group health plans and issuers can provide a document that provides a description of the medical necessity criteria in layperson's terms. However, providing such a summary document is not a substitute for providing the actual underlying medical necessity criteria, if such documents are requested (Reference 8 below).\n    Opioid use disorder benefits. A plan may not impose a prior authorization requirements more stringently on drugs used for opioid treatment disorders than it imposes on prescription drugs used to treat medical/surgical conditions that carry similar safety risks (Reference 9 below). In addition, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors consider by a plan in designing and imposing a fail-first requirement for drugs used to treat opioid use disorders must be comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors used to apply fail-first requirements for medical/surgical benefits (Reference 10 below). Also, if a plan follows nationally-recognized treatment guidelines for setting prior authorization requirements for prescription drugs, but requires prior authorization for opioid treatment disorder prescription drugs every 30 days, at refill, it is violating the MHPAEA, because nationally-recognized treatment guidelines, such as those of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASA) do not support 30-day authorization practices for such opioid disorder treatment medications as buprenorphine/naloxone (Reference 11 below).\n    Experimental treatment DOL FAQs issued in September 2019 address whether it is permissible for a plan to deny claims for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy to treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder under the rationale that the treatment is experimental or investigative. With respect to medical/ surgical conditions, the plan approved treatment when supported by one or more professionally recognized treatment guidelines and two or more controlled random\u00ad ized trials.\n    A medical management standard limiting or excluding benefits based on whether a treatment is experimental or investigative is an NQTL under MHPAEA. Although the plan as written purports to exclude experimental or investigative treatment for both MH/SUD and medicai/surgical benefits using the same standards, in practice, it imposes this exclusion more stringently on MH/SUD benefits, as the plan denies all claims for ABA therapy, despite the fact that professionally recognized treatment guidelines and the requisite number of randomized controlled trials support the use of ABA therapy to treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Accordingly, because the plan applies the NQTL more stringently to mental health benefits than to medical/surgical benefits, the plan's exclusion of ABA therapy as experimental does not cotriply with MHPAEA (Reference 12 below).\n    Likewise, a plan does not comply with the MHPAEA where it defines experimental or investigative treatments as those with a rating below \"B\" in the Hayes Medical Technology Directory, but the plan reviews and covers certain treatments for medical/surgical conditions that have a rating of \"C\" on a treatment-by-treatment basis, while denying all benefits for MH/SUD treatment that have a rating of \"C\" or below, without reviewing the treatments to determine whether exceptions are appropriate. Although the text of the plan sets forth the same evidentiary standard for defining experimental as the Hayes Medical Directory ratings below \"B,\" the plan applies a different evidentiary standard, which is more stringent for MH/SUD benefits than for medical surgical benefits because the unconditional exclusion of treatments with a \"C\" rating for MH/SUD benefits is not comparable to the conditional exclusion of those treatments with a \"C\" rating for medical/surgical benefits. Because of the discrepant application of the evidentiary standard used by the plan, the fact that the plan ultimately denies some medical/surgical benefits that have a rating of \"C\" does not justify the total exclusion of treatments with a \"C\" rating for MH/SUD  (Reference 13 below).\n    Dosage limits. A plan does not comply with MHPAEA where it follows professionally-recognized treatment guidelines when setting dosage limits for prescription medications, but the dosage limit set by the plan for buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder is less than what professionally-recognized treatment guidelines generally recommend. However, the dosage limits set by the plan with respect to medical/surgical benefits are not less than the limits such treatment guidelines recommend. If the plan follows the dosage recommendations in professionally-recognized treatment guidelines to set dosage limits for prescription drugs in its formulary to treat medical/surgical conditions, it must also follow comparable treatment guidelines, and apply them no more stringently, in setting dosage limits for prescription drugs, including buprenorphine, to treat MH/SUD conditions (Reference 14 below).\n    Particular condition or disorder. A large group health plan or large group insurance coverage that provides benefits for prescription drugs to treat both medical/surgical and MH/SUD conditions but contains a general exclusion for items and services to treat a specific mental health condition, including prescription drugs, is permissible under the MHPAEA although if the plan is insured, it would depend on whether state law permits such an exclusion for large group insurance coverage. Generally, MHPAEA requires that treatment limitations imposed on MH/SUD benefits cannot be more restrictive than treatment limitations that apply to medical and surgical benefits. An exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder, however, is not a treatment limitation for purposes of the definition of \"treatment limitations\" in the MHPAEA regulations. Small employer group health insurance coverage and individual health insurance coverage are subject to the requirement to provide essential health benefits, and the determination of whether certain benefits must be covered under the requirements for essential health benefits depends on the benefits in the applicable State's ERB benchmark plan (Reference 15 below).\n    Step therapy. DOL FAQs also address a situation where a health plan requires step therapy for both medical/surgical and MH/SUD in-patient, in-net\u00adwork benefits. The plan requires a participant to have two unsuccessful attempts at outpatient treatment in the past 12 months to be eligible for certain inpatient in\u00ad network SUD benefits. However, the plan only requires one unsuccessful attempt at outpatient treatment in the past 12 months to be eligible for inpatient, in-network medical/ surgical benefits.\n    This is probably not permissible under the MHPAEA, according to the FAQs, because refusing to pay for a higher-cost therapy until it is shown that a lower-cost therapy is not effective (commonly known as \"step therapy protocols\" or \"fail-first policies\") is an NQTL. Although the same NQTL- step therapy- is applied to both MH/SUD benefits and medical/surgical benefits for eligibility for inpatient, in\u00adnetwork services, the requirement for two attempts at outpatient treatment to be eligible for inpatient; in-network SUD benefits is a more stringent application of the NQTL than the requirement for one attempt at outpatient treatment to be eligible for inpatient, in-network medical/surgical benefits. Unless the plan can demonstrate that evidentiary standards or other factors were utilized comparably to develop and apply the differing step therapy requirements for these MH/SUD and medical/surgical benefits, this NQTL does not comply with the MHPAEA (Reference 16 below).\n    Reimbursement rates. A plan also does not comply with the MHPAEA where its plan documents state that in-network provider reimbursement rates are determined based on the providers' required training, licensure, and expertise. However, medical/surgical benefits, reimbursement rates are generally the same for physicians and non-physician practitioners. For MH/SUD benefits, the plan pays reduced reimbursement rates for non-physician practitioners. While a plan is not required to pay identical provider reimbursement rates for medical/surgical and MH/SUD providers, a plan's standards for admitting a provider to participate in a network (including the plan's reimbursement rates for providers) is an NQTL (Reference 17 below).\n    Provider admission to network. DOL FAQs also address standards for provider admission to participate in a network. Such standards are an NQTL. Thus, in setting standards for provider admission to a network, where a plan's process to ensure the plan considers network adequacy with respect to providers of medical/ surgical services is not comparable to its process with respect to providers of MH/ SUD services, the plan does not comply with the MHPAEA To comply with MHPAEA, if the plan takes steps to ensure the plan has an adequate number of in\u00adnetwork medical/surgical providers, the plan must take comparable steps to ensure an adequate number of in-network MH/SUD providers, even if, following those steps, ultimately there are disparate numbers of MH/SUD and medical/surgical providers in the plan's network (Reference 18 below).\n    Non-hospital residential treatment for eating disorders. A plan also does not comply with the MHPAEA where it covers inpatient, out-of-network treatment outside a hospital for medical/surgical conditions so long as a prescribing physician obtains prior authorization from the plan, the treatment is medically appropriate for the individual, and the facility meets the licensing and certification requirements set by the plan, while the plan unequivocally excludes all inpatient, out-of-network treatment outside a hospital (in this FAQ, non-hospital residential treatment) for eating disorders. This restriction on non-hospital residential treatment for eating disorders is not comparable to the plan's coverage restrictions for inpatient treatment outside a hospital for medical/surgical conditions, which are less stringent (Reference 19 below).\n    Out-of-network providers. If a plan offers out-of-network benefits for medical or surgical care, it must also offer out-of-network coverage for mental health and addiction treatment and provide services at parity (Reference 20 below).\n    Availability of plan information. The criteria for medical necessity determinations made under a plan as well as any denial of reimbursement or payment of services with respect to mental health or substance addiction benefits must be made available to a current or potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request (Reference 21 below). Plans that are subject to ERISA must provide the reason for the claim denial in a form and manner consistent with the rules for group health plans in the ERISA claims procedure regulations, which provide (among other things) that such disclosures must be provided automatically and free of charge. In the case of non-federal governmental and church plans (which are not subject to ERISA), compliance with the form and manner of the ERISA claims procedure regulations for group health plans satisfies this disclosure requirement (Reference 22 below).\n    Cost exemption. An employer may elect to apply mental health and substance addiction parity regardless of any increase in total cost. Generally, mental health and substance addiction parity will not apply if actual costs of coverage with respect to mental health and substance addiction benefits exceed two percent during the first plan year under the new law and one percent in each subsequent plan year, as determined and certified by a qualified and licensed actuary (Reference 23 below). The actuary should be a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries and the determination should be in a written report. A plan that qualifies for a cost exemption and elects to implement the exemption shall promptly notify the appropriate Secretary (of the Treasury, Labor or Health and Human Services), the appropriate state agencies, and the participants and beneficiaries.\n\nExceptions\n    Businesses with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the federal mental health parity requirement. The EESA (see discussion above) revises the small employer exemption and provides that the term \"small employer\" means, with respect to a calendar year and a plan year, an employer who employed an average of at least 2 (or 1 in the case of an employer residing in a state that permits small groups to include a single individual) but not more than 50 employees on business days during the preceding calendar year (Reference 24 below).\n    Pointer: The mental health parity rule involves only annual and lifetime limits. It does not require health plans to offer mental health coverage.\n\nPenalty for noncompliance\n    A $100 per day penalty is imposed on employers whose group health plans fail to comply with the mental health parity provisions (Reference 25 below). The penalty is imposed for each day a failure occurs, until it is corrected and applies separately for each individual affected by the failure to comply. However, no penalty is imposed if the failure to comply is unintentional and corrected within 30 days after it is discovered (or should have been discovered). The penalty is limited for unintentional failures to the lesser of (1) 10 percent of the group health plan's expenses for the prior year or (2) $500,000 per tax year.\n\n\"Red flags\" that could mean your plan lacks parity\n    In June 2016, in response to requests for examples that should trigger careful analysis of coverage to determine MHPAEA compliance, the EBSA issued the following list of provisions that can serve as a red flag that a plan or issuer may be imposing an impermissible NQTL (Reference 26 below). The EBSA has stated that these terms do not, of course, automatically violate the law, but adds that the plan or issuer will need to provide evidence of compliance.\n    Also, the following categories are not exhaustive, and they are subordinate to any departmental regulations or interpretive guidance:\n    Preauthorization and pre-service notification requirements. This includes blanket preauthorization requirements and treatment facility admission preauthorization requirements such as requirements of precertification for inpatient mental health treatment. It also includes situations in which a plan's medical management program delegates its review authority to attending physicians for medical and surgical benefits, but does its own reviews for MH/SUD services, and extensive pre-notification requirements.\n    Fail-first protocols. This can include progress requirements, for which a plan requires, for coverage of intensive outpatient treatment for MH/SUD, that a patient has not achieved progress with non-intensive outpatient treatment of less frequency. Also included are treatment attempt requirements, which could include a requirement that a member first attempt two forms of outpatient treatment, or, for any inpatient MH/SUD services, that an individual first complete a partial hospitalization treatment program.\n    Probability of improvement. This could include situations in which a plan only covers services that result in measurable and substantial improvement in mental health status within 90 days.\n    Written treatment plan required. This could include requirements that a written treatment plan be prescribed and supervised by a behavioral health provider, that a treatment plan be submitted within a certain time period, or that a treatment plan submission is made on a regular basis.\n    Other. This includes provisions for patient non-compliance, such as excluding services for chemical dependency if someone fails to comply with a plan of treatment, plus residential treatment limits, geographical limitations, and licensure requirements.\n\nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Sec. 712, as added by P.L. 104-204.

                    "text": "KB-5 - Employee Benefit Marketing - Marketing Process\n\n\tAlthough the main goal of employee benefit marketing is to \"close the sale,\" the process involves two broad categories of activities: those that precede the sale and those that follow the sale. Presale activities include prospecting and the development and presentation of the group insurance proposal; postsale activities include the enrollment of employees and the actual installation, servicing, and renewal of the group insurance plan.\n\nProspecting\n\n\tProspecting is the first step in the marketing process. It involves persuading the employer (or the employer's broker or consultant) to accept a group insurance proposal from the insurance company (or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, HMO, PPO, or other provider of benefits or services). To be successful in actually presenting a proposal, prospecting also involves convincing the employer to provide the information necessary for the preparation of the proposal.\n\n\tThe process of prospecting varies for different segments of the group insurance market. For very small groups (under 10 or 15 employees), the plans marketed are often provided through MEWAs rather than through the traditional group insurance arrangements of insurance companies. Some of the sales activities in this segment are conducted by agents who specialize in group insurance, but a large portion of the sales activities is conducted by agents, brokers, or consultants whose primary sales activities take place in the individual marketplace. (In fact, the multiple-employer trusts of many insurance companies are actually considered for marketing purposes to be part of the product line of the individual insurance department rather than part of the group insurance department.) In many cases, the agent, broker, or consultant has had previous contacts with the employer concerning his or her personal or business insurance. However, it is also in the marketing to small groups that prospecting without known contacts (cold calling) is most likely to take place. Because of the modest premiums that these small groups generate, the agent, broker, or consultant usually carries out all of the sales activities (not just prospecting) with little direct involvement by representatives from the insurance company. It is also becoming increasingly common for insurers to issue proposals online. Because of the limited and relative inflexibility of products available for these small groups, training of agents, brokers, or consultants in this market is often oriented toward what products are available rather than toward group insurance planning in general.\n\n\tAs the size of groups increases, the chance of successful prospecting diminishes rapidly unless the agent, broker, or consultant (1) has a known contact who is a key person in an organization's decision-making process for group insurance matters and (2) has a more sophisticated understanding of group insurance. In these segments of the group insurance market, group representatives spend considerable time training agents, brokers, or consultants in the intricacies of group insurance and motivating them to develop prospects. For medium-sized groups, the agent, broker, or consultant may do the actual prospecting alone or with the group representative, or he or she may give qualified leads to the group representative who will perform this function.\n\n\tFor large groups, the situation is usually different because most large firms retain brokers or consultants to advise them on employee benefit programs and to aid them in the implementation of any decisions they make, including the placing of insurance coverages. Therefore, in this segment of the employee benefit market, prospecting is a two-part process. On one hand, there is intense competition among brokers and consultants to obtain the large firms as clients. On the other hand, clients are seldom successfully approached except through the broker or consultant. Therefore, the prospecting consists of group representatives (and representatives of the Blues and TPAs) who develop a close working relationship with the brokers or consultants to encourage the consideration of the group representatives' organization as a provider of group insurance or other employee benefit products or services.\n\nDeveloping the Proposal\n\nProposal\n\n\tIn the broadest sense, the development of a proposal for a benefit plan involves designing the benefit plan, calculating the premium rate or rates, and putting the proposal in its final form for presentation. Managed care and the availability of varied types of medical expense plans make proposal development especially challenging. Prior to managed care, an insurance company proposal could concentrate on coverage, benefits, and premium with a focus on its reputation for stability and prompt payment of claims. With the advent of managed care, proposals for medical expense coverage needed to address questions on the delivery of care under the managed care plan. Thus, the adequacy of the provider network-including its size, scope of services, and access-became prominent issues. Quality-including the credentials of providers, the accreditation of the plan, and performance measures of the plan-also became selection criteria for employers and their employees.\n\n\tIt is at the proposal stage of the marketing process that insurers do the majority of the underwriting for a case that they ultimately write. In effect, most insurance companies are saying that the benefit plan presented to the employer is probably acceptable to the company at the rates specified if the proposal leads to an application for coverage. However, most insurance companies \"hedge\" their positions and do not make an absolute commitment to write the coverage at this stage, except possibly for very large groups that the senior underwriting personnel have already reviewed . In many cases, field offices do the preliminary underwriting, and the proposal specifies that home office approval is necessary. In addition, the proposal includes any assumptions made in the preliminary underwriting that must be verified before the case is finally accepted. Finally, the proposal lists any underwriting conditions the employer or plan must meet before the insurer will write coverage (such as a certain percentage participation). Obtaining the necessary information for underwriting is often difficult for insurance companies, particularly when the agent, broker, or consultant primarily sells individual insurance. In the individual marketplace, the agent, broker, or consultant is accustomed to obtaining much of the necessary underwriting information at the time of application rather than before the sales presentation. Furthermore, the small employers that these agents, brokers, or consultants approach tend to be less sophisticated in group insurance matters than large employers are, and they often fail to see the necessity to provide detailed information at this point in the sales process. Consequently, for the sales process to continue past the prospecting stage, it is necessary that agents, brokers, and consultants recognize the importance of obtaining underwriting information and that they are willing and able to convey this importance to the employer.\n\n\tThe premium rates presented in the group insurance proposal are based on the employee census that the employer provides prior to the development of the proposal, and thus they are usually only tentative rates, a fact that is\nclearly stated in the proposal. The final premium rates are usually determined at the time a group insurance plan is installed and are based on the census of employees covered under the plan at its inception and possibly on the health of the employees.\n\n\tAlthough variations exist among insurance companies, most proposals contain at least the following information:\n\n\t\t\u2022 a description of each coverage included in the plan\n\t\t\u2022 a schedule of the tentative premium rates and the total premium for each coverage\n\t\t\u2022 a description of the persons eligible for coverage under the plan \n\t\t\u2022 any underwriting assumptions or conditions\n\t\t\u2022 details for servicing the plan, such as the procedures and facilities for administering claims\n\t\t\u2022 general information about the insurance company, including its size, financial strength, and products and services\n\n\tFor large group insurance cases, the proposal usually provides detailed information concerning the insurance company's retention and how the insurer calculates premium rates and reserves.\n\n\tAs with prospecting, the process of developing a proposal differs depending on whether coverage is for a small group, a large client that a broker or consultant controls, or a group that falls somewhere between these two extremes. For small groups that are written through MEWAs, the preparation of a proposal is usually a relatively simple matter. Because little or no flexibility is available for the coverages offered, the plan design consists primarily of an agent, broker, or consultant describing the available options and determining the employer's preferences. The agent, broker,' or consultant typically carries out the preliminary underwriting in the sense that it is his or her responsibility to determine whether the employer meets the trust's relatively rigid underwriting criteria. Because the rate structure is fairly simplified, the agent, broker, or consultant also determines the tentative premium based on the census data provided by the employer. The proposal typically consists of (1) a standard brochure or packet of information that describes the trust and its benefits and (2) a brief premium-calculation presentation that contains a list of the covered employees and the tentative premium the employer must pay for the initial coverage period.\n\n\tUnder some MEWAs, particularly when they are used to write coverage for groups larger than 10 or 15 employees, the insurance company or the administrator of the trust carries out the underwriting, premium calculations, and preparation of the proposal. Furthermore, as the size of the group written through the trust increases, the insurer may also request additional underwriting information (such as past claims history).\n\n\tThe situation is quite different for large groups. For group insurance cases that are not controlled by large brokers or consultants, the group representative plays a major role in the development of the proposal. It is usually the group representative, possibly along with the agent, broker, or consultant, who meets with the employer. Depending on the relationship between the employer and the agent, broker, or consultant, the group representative may have to put considerable effort into convincing the employer that it is worth the time to proceed with the proposal. This includes countering any of the employer's objections and convincing the employer that the insurance company can provide the products and services necessary to meet his or her needs. It is also at this time that the group representative must determine whether the employer is a serious prospect (that is, whether there is some possibility that the employer will add coverages or change insurers). In addition, the group representative must assess whether the employer is likely to meet the underwriting standards of the insurance company. For example, an insurance company may be unwilling to prepare a proposal for an employer that has a history of frequently changing insurers.\n\n\tIf the development of the proposal proceeds beyond the initial contact stage, the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative must (1) determine the employer's objectives, (2) aid the employer in designing the benefit plan for which the proposal will be made, and (3) obtain the information necessary to complete the development of the proposal. The data from the employer is then provided to the insurance company, usually through a field office. The rating and actual design of the proposal is normally conducted at the field office, but except for small cases the underwriting function is likely to be performed at the home office (or at a regional office in the case of large insurance companies). However, for very large cases, it is common for the insurance company to complete the entire process, not just the underwriting, at some level higher than the field office.\n\n\tTo complete the proposal, the insurance company obviously needs a description of the benefit plan desired and a census of employees (covered, not actively working, and on COBRA continuation) containing any information that affects underwriting or premium calculations. At a minimum, this information probably includes age and gender, but it may also include marital status, geographic location, income, and an indication of whether there are dependents. This census may have an actual list of employees by name or it may consist of aggregate data. In addition, most insurance companies commonly request the following information from the prospect or the prospect's agent, broker, or consultant:\n\n\t\t\u2022 the reason for transferring (unless it is a new case) \n\t\t\u2022 the nature of the employer's industry\n\t\t\u2022 a history of changes in the number of employees over the least 2 or 3 years\n\t\t\u2022 a statement indicating whether the plan is contributory and, if so, the amount of the employer's contribution\n\t\t\u2022 the length of time with the current insurer\n\t\t\u2022 premiums, rates, and claims experience with the current insurer for each line of coverage (usually for the previous 3 years)\n\t\t\u2022 a statement indicating whether collective bargaining is involved\n\t\t\u2022 copies of information about the current plan (such as benefit booklets or certificates of insurance)\n\t\t\u2022 the most recent premium statement from the current insurer\n\t\t\u2022 any renewal information from the current insurer for the past year or two\n\t\t\u2022 any ongoing large claims\n\n\tWhen a large broker or consultant controls a group insurance case, the broker or consultant designs the benefit plan in conjunction with the employer. In some cases, the business is placed with the existing insurance company or with a company that is either wanted by the employer or recommended by the broker or consultant. In other cases, bids are requested from several sources based on specifications prepared by the broker or consultant. In general, the bidding process is not open to every insurance company (or other provider of benefits) but is on an invitation basis. The decision about which insurance companies are invited to bid may be made at the discretion of the consultant or may be determined by the employer. For example, some employers may want bids only from companies headquartered in the same state.\n\n\tThe bidding specifications are accompanied by a cover letter that invites the insurance company to bid and states the last date on which bids may be received or postmarked. This date is usually from 45 to 90 days prior to the date coverage becomes effective. The specifications typically consist of a description of the plan desired, a census of employees, and any information the insurance company needs to properly underwrite and rate the case (see the previous list). Based on this data, the insurance company is asked to present a bid in the form of monthly and annual premiums for the coverage desired. In addition, a \"net cost illustration\" or \"retention exhibit\" is usually requested for a 2- to 5-year period. This illustration must show the projected premiums, incurred claims, retention, and dividends for each year, and it is often required to be based on assumptions listed in the specifications. The definitions of many of the preceding terms can vary.\n\n\tThe insurance company is typically confronted with a rigid set of specifications on which it must bid. However, some specifications are flexible and allow an insurance company to suggest changes in the specifications and to present a bid based on these suggestions. Furthermore, the specifications ask numerous questions about the insurance company's practices and ability to service the case. The following are only a few of the many questions that the specifications commonly contain:\n\n\t\t\u2022 How are incurred claims defined? \n\t\t\u2022 How is retention defined?\n\t\t\u2022 How is the level of reserves determined? \n\t\t\u2022 What is the interest rate credited to reserves?\n\t\t\u2022 How are catastrophic losses handled in the experience-rating process?\n\t\t\u2022 What charges are levied against the group's experience when coverage is converted?\n\t\t\u2022 For what period of time are rates guaranteed?\n\t\t\u2022 How much notice of rate changes is given at renewal? \n\t\t\u2022 What is the procedure for handling claims?\n\t\t\u2022 What services are provided in the area of cost containment?\n\t\t\u2022 If you are selected to provide coverage, on what date will the master contract and certificates of insurance be delivered?\n\t\t\u2022 Are there any additional costs for materials such as benefit booklets?\n\nChallenges with Managed Care Plans\n\n\tManaged care and the broad availability of varied medical expense plans and employer sponsorship of plan options often make proposal development especially challenging.\n\n\tPrior to managed care, an insurance company proposal could concentrate on coverage, benefits, and premium with a focus on its reputation for stability and prompt payment of claims. With the advent of managed care, proposals needed to address questions on the delivery of care under the managed care plan. Thus, the adequacy of the provider network, including its size, scope of services, and access became prominent issues. Quality, too, including the credentials of providers and the accreditation of the health plan overall by such organizations as NCQA, became paramount. All of these areas, along with performance measures, became plan selection criteria for employers and their employees.\n\n\tToday, few employers offer their employees only a single plan; many employers offer two or more options that allow employees to choose among traditional, HMO, POS, or PPO plans. Increasingly, these plans feature consumer-directed health plan funds that are associated with HRAs and/or HSAs.\n\n\tThus, insurers must carefully evaluate the underwriting implications and loss potential of employee selection among the options they offer based on differences in coverage, benefits, limitations on utilization and provider choice, and employee out-of-pocket payments. Such payments are determined not only by copayments, deductibles, and other self-responsible amounts, but also by the level of employer contribution to the premium of each option and the funding of consumer-directed health care accounts.\n\n\tA single insuring entity may offer all the options that an employer wishes to sponsor. If so, it eases the proposal burden of the insuring organization, whether a managed care organization or a traditional insurance company, to the extent that it is responsible for the group's total medical expenses. In this case, the insurer has a greater opportunity to recover losses due to adverse selection or other cost factors in one option through the positive experience under another or through overall premium adjustments for the overall account.\n\n\tHowever, in many cases, employers may select more than one company to offer the options. In such cases, the insurer must be particularly cautious about the plan features mentioned above that differentiate the available options and could create adverse selection against its options in favor of the options offered by another insurer, thereby making recovery of losses difficult.\n\nPresenting the Proposal\n\n\tThe successful presentation of a proposal leads to a sale that closes when the employer submits a signed application and the first periodic premium. For small groups, the agent, broker, or consultant makes the presentation of the proposal directly to the employer. In general, there is little room for negotiations, and the employer either accepts or rejects the initial proposal. In some cases, however, the proposal may contain two or three choices in plan design.\n\n\tFor large groups when the employer is dealt with directly, the agent, broker, or consultant may also present the proposal. However, because of the technical expertise necessary, the group representative is probably involved, and either presents the proposal or assists in its presentation. It is at this point that further negotiation on plan design and revision of the proposal are most likely to occur.\n\n\tWhen a large broker or consultant puts a group insurance case out to bid, there is usually no direct contact between the insurance company and the employer in the initial stages of the presentation. Rather, the group representative usually makes the presentation to the broker or consultant, who then evaluates all such proposals and makes a recommendation to the employer. This recommendation may be for the employer to select a specific proposal, but it often consists of presenting an employer with two or three proposals that best meet the employer's objectives. In this latter instance, the group representatives of the insurance companies involved are typically asked to meet with both the broker or consultant and the employer to further discuss the proposals. At this stage of the process, it is not unusual to give each company in contention a copy of the proposals that their competitors have submitted.\n\nEnrollment\n\n\tThe first step in the postsale activities of group marketing involves the enrollment of employees in the plan. If the plan is noncontributory, the employer must provide the insurance company with enrollment cards or a list of all employees to be covered and a certification that they have met all eligibility requirements, such as being actively at work or having satisfied a probationary period. If a plan is contributory, it must be properly marketed to the employees in order to encourage the maximum enrollment. In fact, unless the solicitation of employees is effective, the actual installation of the plan may never occur because of insufficient enrollment. Usually, the insurance company prepares the solicitation materials, such as letters or benefit booklets. For small employers, these may be standardized materials, but for large employers, they are custom designed. If a group is large enough, the insurance company may even prepare audiovisual presentations. Although the actual solicitation always involves the employer, it may consist only of the employer providing these materials to the employees. However, it is common for the employer to allow group meetings (during normal working hours) in which the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative can explain the plan to the employees and answer their questions.\n\n\tThe actual enrollment of employees either shortly follows or takes place simultaneously with the solicitation process. It consists of requesting the employees to complete enrollment forms supplied by the insurance company. These enrollment forms are usually brief, but they have more detail if the plan involves any individual underwriting of employees in addition to the usual group underwriting or if employees have a choice of alternative plans. Although the agent, broker, consultant, or group representative may conduct the actual enrollment, it is common for the employer's supervisory personnel to carry out this activity.\n\n\tAlthough proper marketing of a contributory plan to employees is crucial, a noncontributory plan must also be properly presented to employees if they are to fully understand and appreciate its provisions. In many cases, this means that the plan is presented to employees in virtually the same manner as if it were contributory.\n\nInstallation\n\n\tWhen the enrollment procedure is completed, the insurance company calculates the final premium rates and prepares the master contract (or joinder agreement in the case of a multiple-employer trust) and any other administrative materials for the employer as well as the certificates of insurance for the employees. The agent, broker, or consultant usually delivers these materials to small employers. In larger cases, the group representative, accompanied by the agent, broker, or consultant, usually performs the task. The agent, broker, consultant, or group representative thoroughly reviews the plan at this point with the employer and explains its administrative aspects, such as premium billings, claims procedures, and the enrollment and termination of employees. The importance of this meeting with the employer should not be ignored because the future success of a group insurance case is often a function of how well these administrative procedures are explained and thus understood by the employer.\n\n\tThe prominence of managed care plans makes the prompt and accurate performance of these installation procedures even more important. For example, enrollment (as well as termination of enrollment) may affect the payment of network providers, in particular those receiving capitation or incentive program payments per member. Premiums must also be collected promptly and accurately because such payments may have to be made in advance of the delivery of services to members. Network physicians unable to verify enrollment are unlikely to accept the plan's copayment amount from their patients, preferring instead to bill their usual charges for services.\n\nServicing the Case\n\n\tSimilarly, the importance of properly servicing a group insurance case cannot be overlooked. Good service not only increases the employer's satisfaction, but it also minimizes the possibility that the employer will transfer the case to another insurance company at the time of renewal. In addition, it may also lead to other business for the insurance company or the agent, broker, or consultant when the employer adds a new coverage or renews an existing coverage.\n\n\tThe process of servicing a case begins at the initial sale and continues throughout its life. The agent, broker, or consultant-often with the assistance of the group representative-usually conducts the servicing. However, some insurance companies have trained personnel whose sole function is to service group insurance cases, which allows the group representative to devote more of his or her time to sales activities. Most requests for service relate to routine administrative matters that involve billing, claims, or enrollment procedures. As previously mentioned, proper installation minimizes these requests. To discover whether there is any difficulty with a group insurance case at its earliest stage, the group representative must develop a close working relationship with other functional departments of the insurance company. For example, correspondence between the employer and claims personnel may be the first indication of any potential dissatisfaction.\n\n\tEven when no specific problems exist, the agent, broker, or consultant schedules periodic visits with the employer to discuss such items as the administration of the plan, claim trends, and new federal or state regulations that affect the plan. These visits may lead to suggestions that the employer make changes in the plan so that it better meets the employer's desires and needs.\n\n\tOne of the most important and possibly most difficult aspects of servicing a group insurance case occurs at the time of renewal, particularly if a rate increase is proposed (which is almost always the situation today for medical expense insurance). The shock of a large rate increase may be a catalyst that encourages an employer to seek out another insurance company. Therefore, it is important for the agent, broker, or consultant to keep the employer periodically informed of the group's experience and current trends so that the size of the increase is not unexpected. It is also at renewal time that the agent, broker, or consultant (often accompanied by the group representative) should thoroughly review the group insurance case to determine whether it is appropriate to make any changes. If the employer is considering changing insurance companies, the agent, broker, or consultant should emphasize any potential limitations of such an action. For example, the installation of a new plan will undoubtedly incur additional administrative costs. Furthermore, there may be the potential for some employees to lose benefits in the transfer because of differing provisions of the new insurance company's plan or the inability of an employee to immediately meet an actively-at-work requirement."

                    "text": "KB-5 -   Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Claims\n\nCLAIMS\n     The handling of medical expense claims is different, depending on whether a plan provides benefits on an indemnity basis or on a service basis.\n\n      Subrogation provisions may also apply.\n\nIndemnity Benefits\n       Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on an indemnity basis typically require that the insurance company (or other provider) receive a written proof of loss (that is, a claim form) concerning the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which a covered person makes a claim. This form usually contains portions that must be completed and signed by the employee, a representative of the employer, and the provider of medical services.\n\n      The period during which an employee must file a claim depends on the provider of coverage and any applicable state requirements. An employee generally has at least 90 days (or as soon as is reasonably possible) after medical expenses are incurred to file. Some insurance companies require notification within a shorter time (such as 20 days) about any illness or injury on which a claim may be based, even though they give a longer time for the actual filing of the form itself.\n\n       Individuals have the right to assign their benefits to the providers of medical services. A covered person generally makes such an assignment, which authorizes the insurance company to make the benefit payment directly to the provider by completing the appropriate portion of the claim form. In addition, the insurance company has the right (as it does in disability income insurance) to examine any person for whom a claim is filed at its own expense and with the physician of its own choice.\n\nService Benefits\n      Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on a service basis (such as HMOs and the Blues) generally do not require that covered persons file claim forms. Rather, the providers of health care services perform any necessary paperwork and receive reimbursement directly.\n\n      For example, when a physician presents a claim, the plan must determine one or more of the following: the physician's status as a network participant; the primary or specialty care nature of the service if rendered by a network participant; and the applicability of an authorization requirement. Depending upon the plan's stringency, the provider's reimbursement may be denied altogether or be far less than the amount charged if the member receives services from a nonnetwork provider or sees a specialist without a required referral. In turn, the payment made to the provider determines whether the enrollee must pay a modest copayment, a more substantial amount under an indemnity benefit as described above, or the total amount if there is a claim denial.\n\n      Network providers with capitation payment arrangements file patient encounter forms that in effect are claims that produce no payment for a specific service.\n\nSubrogation\n       Most self-funded plans contain subrogation provisions. If state law allows, they are also commonly contained in the group medical expense contracts of HMOs, PPOs, the Blues, and insurance companies. A subrogation provision gives the plan (or the organization providing plan benefits) the right to recover from a third party who is responsible through negligence or other wrongdoing for a covered person's injuries that result in a claim payment. If a covered person receives a settlement from the third party (or their liability insurance company) for medical expenses that the plan has already paid, the covered person must reimburse the plan. The plan also has the right to seek a recovery from the party at fault for benefits paid if the person who receives benefits does not take legal action.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Developing a Health Care Strategy\n\nDEVELOPING A HEALTH CARE STRATEGY\n\n\tDeveloping a health care strategy for providing employee health and medical care benefits can be viewed as a program for managing risk exposures on a variety of levels. In its most elementary form, managing this risk involves a three-pronged strategy. First, the organization sponsoring the plan must decide what mode of health care delivery system will be used. Second, the organization must decide on the benefits that will be provided through the selected system. Third, the plan sponsor must decide what contractual, financial, or payment arrangement will be negotiated with insurers or providers of medical care. Negotiation of the financial arrangement also includes what level of risk is assumed by the plan sponsor and whether certain types or levels of risk will be shifted to a third party such as an insurer or the providers of the medical care itself. Increasingly, plan sponsors shift some of this risk to ensure that medical providers have a stake in providing cost-effective and quality care. All three of these macro decisions involve many other tiers of decisions at the micro level, which can have a profound impact on the levels of risk assumed and the financial costs assumed by the plan sponsor. With the advent of health care reform, additional risks have been entered into the system, since plan sponsors may be subject to providing subsidies or vouchers (see subsequent discussion in this chapter) to some of their employees and/or will be subject to certain excise taxes.\n\nDesigning the Plan and Delivery System\n\n\tThe plan sponsor is not only selecting one of the delivery systems discussed previously, but also has latitude to select various plan designs offered by alternate delivery systems or to include plan-specific provisions or procedures particular to the employer group. Unless federal or state law requires certain benefits, an employer quite often has flexibility to design its own schedule of benefits, assuming it is of sufficient size to gain this degree of customization by an insurer or managed care company. At times, even state insurance law is not an immovable constraint, because certain administrative service financing arrangements exempt plans from state insurance mandates. Limitations on specific coverages, uses of deductibles or copayments, and the systems for case management and precertification can profoundly impact both risk exposure and cost. The delivery system and plan design, its oversight, and financial incentives also can have behavioral impacts on plan participants influencing the utilization of health care services.\n\n\tWith the passage of major health care reform legislation in 2010, a new era began in structuring health benefit programs. Additional regulation at the federal level immediately impacted plan design decisions. For example, this is evident in the previously described distinction between grandfathered and non grandfathered plans. PPACA also distinguished between large and small employer plans. The Act included a tax credit for small employers that purchased health insurance for their employees when the employer\n\n\t\u25a0 Has fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees\n\t\u25a0 Pays average annual wages under $50,000\n\t\u25a0 Contributes a uniform percentage of at least 50 percent of the total premium cost\n\n\tThe full credit is available to employers with ten or fewer full-time equivalent employees and average annual wages of less than $25,000, and begins phasing out over those amounts. (Beginning in 2014, the credit is available only for qualified health plan coverage purchased through a health exchange, and employers may only receive the credit for a maximum of two consecutive years.)\n\nVarious insurance market reforms mandated by PPACA placed constraints on plan sponsor design decisions. For instance, six months after enactment, group health plans and health insurers were not allowed to\n\n\t\u25a0 Impose lifetime or annual limits on essential benefits (subject to certain exceptions).\n\t\u25a0 Rescind coverage unless there was fraud or misrepresentation by the enrollee.\n\t\u25a0 Drop coverage for adult children on their parents' coverage, regardless of the adult child's student or marital status, until the adult child turns 26 years old.\n\t\u25a0 Impose preexisting condition exclusions on enrollees under age 19.\n\nSelf-Administration, Third-Party Administrators, and Unbundled Services\n\n\tThe decision to purchase an assembled delivery system from an insurer or managed care company or to directly contract with providers is generally dependent on employer size and the geographic concentrations of an organization's employees. When an employer is of sufficient size, it might want to deal directly with medical providers and eliminate the costs associated with the intermediary insurer. Even if an employer does not want to assume the burden of self-administration, it is not necessary to purchase all medical care management services through a single provider. An employer can decide to unbundle specific services that might be more effectively performed by separate entities or purchase an integrated set of services or programs through one provider. Moving specific, specialized functions to third-party vendors with special expertise in one area can sometimes address certain goals. At the very least, an employer should understand the costs of these services if they are left bundled with the insurer and review claims and other reports to evaluate the services' effectiveness and contributions to cost control.\n\n\tUnder PPACA, by 2014, certain employers' employees gain access to health insurance through health exchanges. PPACA requires each state to establish one or more health exchanges in which small employers and individuals can purchase health insurance. Initially, only small employers have access to purchase group health insurance through an exchange. However, by 2017, states may permit large employers to purchase group health coverage through their exchanges. States have the right to define \"small\" and \"large\" employers before 2016, though small employers generally will not exceed 100 employees. Lawful United States' residents (except incarcer\u00ad ated individuals) generally can access individual health coverage through an exchange in a state in which they live.\n\nUse of Multiple Plan Offerings and Single or Multiple Administrators\n\n\tMedical care delivery systems and benefit design are not an \"all-or\u00ad nothing\" decision for many large employers. Though some employers place their entire block of business with a single insurer or managed care company, many other employers have configured a variety of health plan alternatives and give employees the choice of selecting the health plan that best meets their individual needs. This can be accomplished through a simple choice of medical plan options or through a flexible benefit plan. In large part because of limited dollars available to expand benefit programs and a recognition that a diverse workforce may have varying benefit needs, flexible benefit programs proliferated in the 1980s. In a flex plan, employees are allocated a set amount generally in the form of credits or dollars from the employer, which they can \"spend\" to select the benefits and plan options of their choice or receive those credits in the form of cash if not spent on benefits. Nevertheless, many managed care companies and insurers offer employers an array of multiple plan designs. Price concessions are often offered if an employer agrees to place the entire block of business with a single administrative entity. An employer must balance the price concessions it will receive and assess the effectiveness of the administrative entity at managing health care costs against the loss of competition that occurs when multiple plan offerings through various administrators are eliminated.\n\nPricing Plan Options and Designing Employer Subsidies\n\n\tRegardless of whether multiple administrators or a single administrator are used for separate plan offerings, the plan sponsor must look at the pricing of plan options and make decisions regarding the form and amount of employer subsidy provided to employees. An employer offering a flexible benefit program may price various plan options at prevailing market rates, assign all employees an equal credit amount, and allow them to spend the credits as they prefer. Other employers provide a direct subsidy to their medical plans and only show employees the remaining employee costs they will be required to pay. Some employers subsidize family contracts to a greater extent than single coverage. The employer must also decide how to relate the subsidy to each medical plan option. Plan pricing will affect employee selection patterns. Premiums are impacted by the level of deductibles and co-payments that have been included in the front-end plan design. Accordingly, an employer can determine whether plan costs and certain benefits are being borne by those utilizing those particular benefits or are being spread over the employee group at large.\n\nMore transparency and analysis on pricing plan options emerged in the wake of PPACA's passage. The Act imposed penalties, effective 2014, on employers with an average of 50 or more employees who\n\n\t\u25a0 Offer inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage or do not offer minimum essential coverage; or\n\t\u25a0 Have at least one full-time employee who qualifies for federal premium assistance for coverage through an exchange\n\nThe penalty varies depending on whether the employer fails to offer minimum essential coverage or offers inadequate or unaffordable minimum essential coverage. Effective 2018, employers who provide health benefits deemed to be too generous will also be assessed penalties. An employer sponsoring a so-called \"Cadillac\" group health plan is required to pay a 40 percent excise tax on the excess value of the coverage.\n\nThe Effects of Multiple Plan Offerings on Employee Selection Patterns and Pricing\n\n\tThe offering of multiple benefit offerings can create an exodus of favorable risks from existing offerings and result in price escalations for those who choose to stay with a previously offered plan. In some cases, the offering of a new plan at favorable pricing can cause such dramatic migration out of a plan that the remaining plan will experience a price spiral that causes termination of the plan. This was particularly true in the mid-1980s for many employers who offered traditional indemnity plans. The offering of either a less expensive comprehensive plan or an HMO resulted in those employees with low utilization for major services migrating to the less costly plans, seeking to reduce their expenditures on monthly health care premiums. With this loss of favorable risks, the indemnity plan retained less favorable risks with higher utilization patterns. Because there was a smaller pool of favorable risks in the plan over which to spread plan costs, the premiums charged to those who remained increased. This increase in plan costs resulted in another wave of more favorable risks choosing to leave the plan rather than bear the increased costs of the plan. Again costs increased, giving further incentive for favorable risks to migrate from the plan. Ultimately, a cost spiral like this will cause a plan to become prohibitively expensive and result in its demise.\n\n\tAs the provisions of PPACA are phased in, employers will need to be vigilant regarding the effects that alternative access to coverage through health exchanges have on their employee selection patterns and pricing. Effective 2014, employers that pay for any portion of health coverage and offer minimum essential coverage are required to supply \"free choice vouchers\" to qualified employees to purchase qualified health coverage through an exchange. A qualified employee eligible for free choice vouch\u00ad ers has the following characteristics:\n\n\t\u25a0 His or her required contribution for minimum essential coverage through the employer's plan exceed 8 percent but is less than 9.8 percent of the employee's annual household income.\n\t\u25a0 His or her household income does not exceed 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\t\u25a0 He or she does not participate in an employer-sponsored health plan.\n\n\tThe value of the free choice voucher is the most generous amount that the employer would have contributed under the firm's plan for self-only coverage or, if relevant, family coverage. Employers are required to pay this sum to an exchange. Subsequently, the exchange credits the amount towards the monthly premium for the plan selected by the employee. When the free choice voucher amount exceeds the exchange plan premium, the difference is refunded to the employee and is subject to taxation. Employers may deduct the amount paid in vouchers and are not assessed the employer mandate penalty for employees receiving vouchers.\n\nDesigning the Underwriting and Financial Arrangements\n\n\tAs indicated in the discussion of alternative financing techniques, an employer can dramatically alter the financial arrangement of its medical benefits program by determining the amount of risk it will accept. The strategic issue is to select a financial arrangement that controls costs and allows management to assume the level of risk that it believes appropriate for its employee group. The financial arrangement selected can have a behavioral impact on both the providers managing care and the insurer or administrator responsible for management of the plan. Increasingly, employers have explored arrangements that shift more risk to health care providers and that promote incentives to provide quality care. Much research, is being done on measuring quality of care and developing information systems that can be used to evaluate cost and quality of care.\n\n\tThe financial strategy for a medical benefits program will have multiple tiers. This is particularly true if multiple plan options are available and employees choose between plan offerings. Plan pricing and plan offerings can alter enrollment patterns and affect the effectiveness of a given financial arrangement or risk-management strategy.\n\n\tDetermining cost-effective medical providers and health plans is not an easy exercise. Certain plans will attract employees from certain demographic and geographic constituencies because of plan benefits or the convenience of provider locations. Health care costs are directly correlated with age, in that older individuals tend to need more care and need to access more extensive and thus more expensive care. Likewise, there can be regional differences in the cost of medical care. Sometimes, base premium costs or allocated costs per participant are not the best indicator of cost-effective medical care. Analyzing plan costs by adjusting for demographic, geographic, and other variables in the plan population is the best way to evaluate the cost efficiency.\n\nMeasuring Performance and Managing the Plan\n\n\tA final attribute of health care strategy is to create a system of monitoring and measuring the attainment of plan objectives. It is also important to have a system of controls that ensures that the plan is being effectively managed. A well-developed plan design is of little use if a third-party administrator is unable to administer the design as it was intended. A system for auditing plan results, ensuring quality outcomes, and reporting utilization is necessary. For this reason, any delegation of responsibilities for health plan management should involve negotiation on the management reporting responsibilities of the administrator and the performance standards it is expected to achieve. Assigning financial penalties or providing rewards associated with these performance standards can be very effective. For instance, with a traditional insured product, a plan sponsor can require claims payment within a certain number of days for a percent of the claims. With a managed care provider operating a staff model HMO, reporting could be required on the telephone systems for contacting PCPs. There could be performance criteria on the amount of time it takes to reach a physician by phone, and scheduling standards for the amount of time between the initial call and an available appointment.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Introduction to Managed Care Plans\n\nA true managed care plan should have five main characteristics: \ncontrolled access to providers\ncomprehensive utilization management\npreventive care risk sharing\nhigh-quality care\n\n           The major characteristic of managed care plans that differentiates them from traditional medical expense plans is probably the limitations on the choice of medical care providers that may be used. The question arises as to whether these choice limitations lead to a different quality of care. Despite these apparent or perceived differences, more than 95 percent of the population is now in some type of managed care plan, and the majority seems reasonably satisfied with the arrangement. In the past few years, much of the growth in managed care has come from employers with fewer than 50 employees. Unlike larger employers, who usually give employees a choice between one or more plans, small employers are more likely to offer a single managed care plan rather than any options.\n\n            Despite the relatively high level of satisfaction, there has been some recent consumer backlash against managed care that has led to plan changes and legislation, particularly at the state level.\n\nLimited Choice of Medical Providers\n             Managed care plans attempt to eliminate the unrestricted use of medical care providers by either requiring or encouraging members to use preapproved network providers. The earliest managed care plans, which were HMOs, usually provided no coverage for treatment outside the managed care network. This discouraged enrollment because many Americans valued the choice that had traditionally been available when they needed medical treatment.\n\n             The concept of managed care received considerable attention in the late 1960s and early 1970s, culminating in the passage of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. The act resulted in modest growth of HMO plans, but the real growth that came later for managed care was encouraged by several developments that gave members more choice in selecting providers of medical care. One of these changes was more flexibility under HMO plans. For example, many of the early HMOs assigned a primary physician to a new member. Gradually, new forms of HMOs developed and existing HMOs were modified to allow members to select a primary care physician from a list of primary care providers.\n\n              At the same time, the traditional insurance industry was entering managed care, primarily through the marketing of PPO products, which allowed more flexibility than most HMOs with respect to selection of specialists. In addition, benefits were usually available for treatment received outside a managed care network, although at a reduced payment level.\n\n              The popularity of PPO products with both employers and employees forced the HMOs to adopt even more flexibility. They did this through the establishment of point-of-service plans, which covered nonnetwork treatment. The typical POS plan is more flexible than a typical HMO but more restrictive than a typical PPO product. However, the variations in all three types of plans today are so significant that it is sometimes difficult to determine exactly what is typical.\n\n             Survey statistics on the availability of managed care plans to employees vary. One recent survey, however, estimated that 76 percent of employees had PPO plans available to them. (Reference 22 below) The percentages for traditional HMOs and POS plans were 39 and 16, respectively.\n\nQuality of Care\n              A difficult question to answer is whether persons covered by managed care plans receive the same quality of care as persons covered under traditional medical expense plans. If the sole objective of a managed care plan is to offer coverage at the lowest possible cost, the quality of care may decline. However, some type of quality assurance program is one aspect of any managed care plan. If properly administered, this type of program can weed out providers who give substandard and unnecessary care. In this regard, managed care plans may be more progressive than the medical field as\na whole.\n\n              The results of numerous surveys and studies on the quality of medical care plans are mixed. Some studies show that persons in managed care plans are less likely than persons in traditional medical expense plans to receive treatment for a serious medical condition from specialists, and they are also likely to have fewer diagnostic tests. There are those who argue that family physicians can treat a wide variety of illnesses and avoid unnecessary\ndiagnostic tests and referrals to specialists. On the other hand, an opposing argument contends that the decline in the use of specialists and frequency of diagnostic tests is also a clear indication that there is a decline in the level of medical care. Other studies show that persons in managed care plans are much more likely than the rest of the population to receive preventive care and early diagnosis and treatment of potentially serious conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. In addition, some managed care plans have been successful in coordinating care when it is necessary for a person to see several different types of specialists. There is no doubt that there are some small provider networks with a limited choice of specialists, but most networks are relatively large or allow persons to select treatment outside the network. There are also many managed care plans that do refer members to highly regarded physicians and hospitals or have these providers as part\nof their networks.\n\n               In evaluating the quality of medical care, it is also interesting to look at surveys of participants in the various types of medical expense plans. Most persons in traditional medical expense plans are convinced they receive better care because of their unlimited ability to choose providers of medical care as needed. Although surveys of members in managed care plans usually show a high degree of satisfaction with the medical care received, there are some concerns that have resulted in recent plan changes and legislative actions and interest.\n\n                Two developments over the last two decades relate to the quality of care provided by managed care organizations-an increased interest in accreditation and a consumer backlash against some aspects of managed care. This backlash has led to the introduction or passage of laws in many states aimed at solving consumer and provider concerns about access to care, quality of care, and choice.\n\n\nAccreditation\naccreditation\t\n                As managed care matured and became more widespread, there was an increasing focus by government, employers, and consumers on quality. This led many employers, particularly large employers, to require that managed care organizations for their employees meet some type of accreditation standards. Accreditation does more than just provide consumers with information about health plans. The process, which may cost a managed care organization several thousand dollars, compares it with benchmark standards of quality care. The organization knows where it stands in relation to its competitors and what it must do to become accredited or to achieve a higher level of accreditation.\n\n\nNational Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)\n                The leading organization for accreditation appears to be the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), an independent, not-for-profit organization that has been accrediting managed care plans since 1991. (The NCQA's Web site is ncqa.org.) It also accredits or certifies anumber of other types of programs, including physician organizations and organizations that provide behavioral health care, utilization management, disease management, and credentials verification. Unlike some accrediting organizations, NCQA makes detailed information available to the public. The NCQA rates managed care organizations by evaluating each of the following five areas of performance:\n                 Access and service. Do plan members have access to the care and service they need? For example, are physicians in the health plan free to discuss all treatment options available? Do patients report problems getting needed care? How well does the health plan follow up on grievances?\n                 Qualified providers. Does the plan assess each physician's qualifications and what do plan members say about their providers? For example, does the plan regularly check the licenses and training of physicians? How do plan members rate their personal physician or nurse?\n                 Staying healthy. Does the plan help people maintain good health and avoid illness? Does it give its physicians guidelines about how to provide appropriate preventive health services? Are members receiving tests and screenings as appropriate?\n                  Living with illness. How well does the plan care for people with chronic conditions? Does the plan have programs in place to assist patients in managing chronic conditions such as asthma? Do diabetics, who are at risk for blindness, receive eye exams as needed?\n                   Getting better. How well does the plan care for people when they become sick? How does it evaluate new medical procedures, drugs, and devices to ensure that patients have access to safe and effective care?\n\nThe possible ratings for each area of performance are best, very good, good, fair, or poor. From this information, the NCQA also gives overall accreditation outcomes to managed care plans. For HMOs and point-of-service plans, these ratings are\nexcellent \ncommendable \naccredited \nprovisional \ndenied\n\nFor PPOs, they are\nfull\none-year provisional denied\n\n\nHealth Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)\n               The NCQA also has a set of performance measures that are designed to enable purchasers and consumers to have necessary information to reliably compare the\nperformance of managed care plans. These measures are commonly referred to as the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS. The current version (which tends to change almost annually) has more than 70 measures that fall into the following categories:\neffectiveness of care \naccess/availability of care\nsatisfaction with the experience of care \nhealth plan stability\nuse of services cost of care\nhealth plan descriptive information\n\n\nExamples of a few of the measures that HEDIS reports, which can then be compared with suggested norms, are the following:\npercentage of adolescents receiving immunizations\npercentage of patients receiving beta blocker treatment following a heart attack\npercentage of patients receiving appropriate treatment for asthma percentage of women receiving osteoporosis management\n\n           Other bodies also play a major role in accrediting various types of health care organizations, including managed care plans, and make their data available to consumers. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has accredited hospitals for many years. It also accredits home care organizations, assisted-living facilities, long-term\ncare facilities, behavioral health care organizations, ambulatory care organizations, and laboratory services (Web site: jcaho.org).\n\n           Another major accrediting organization is URAC (formerly the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission). URAC focuses on accrediting specific aspects of managed care, such as health utilization management. Managed care organizations, such as HMOs and PPOs, can have their own utilization management activities accredited if they meet prescribed standards. In addition, URAC accredits the activities of organizations that specialize solely in utilization management and that sell their services to managed care plans which do not have their own utilization management staffs. URAC also accredits organizations with respect to other aspects of managed care, including the following: case management, disease management, call center standards, network credentialing standards, and pharmacy benefit management. (Web site: urac.org).\n\nReactions to Consumer and Provider Concerns\n            As previously mentioned, the majority of employers and employees are reasonably satisfied with managed care plans but have increasing concerns. However, the satisfaction of physicians and other providers is much more negative, primarily because of decreased control over medical decisions\nfor their patients and a loss of income. As a result, there has been what the media describe as a \"backlash against managed care.\" In some ways, this terminology is inaccurate. First, some of the public's concerns, such as the lack of complete mental health parity and the issue of plans sometimes denying coverage as unnecessary, apply to the entire health care system. Second, although some of the concerns apply to all types of managed care plans, many apply solely to practices of HMOs.\n\nThis backlash has had several results:\n\u2022 States continue to enact legislation that addresses many of the concerns.\n\u2022 Managed care organizations voluntarily modify their practices in light of legislative activity and competitive forces.\n\u2022 The federal government continues to grapple with consumer legislation.\n\nState Reform\n            State legislatures in recent years have passed several types of laws aimed at managed care reform. Many of these laws, which exist in anywhere from 12 to almost all states, include the following:\n\u2022 antigag-clause rules\n\u2022 grievance, review, and appeal procedures\n\u2022 any-willing-provider laws \n\u2022 mandatory POS options\n\u2022 continuity of care \n\u2022 provider protection\n\u2022 emergency room coverage mental health parity diabetes health benefits\n\u2022 minimum stays for certain procedures plastic surgery mandates\n\u2022 direct access to providers\n             A smaller number of states have also passed other types of reform legislation.\n             Some of these changes tend to bring managed care plans closer to traditional indemnity plans in terms of both coverage and cost.\n\n \nantigag-clause legislation\n             Antigag-Clause Rules. Almost all states have adopted antigag-clause legislation that prohibits managed care organizations from having provisions in their contracts that prevent physicians from discussing with patients treatment options that their plan may not cover or from referring very ill patients for specialized care by providers outside the plan.\n\n             Grievance, Review, and Appeal Procedures. A concern of many consumers over the years has been that managed care plans did not have adequate procedures to receive complaints or appeals about denials of coverage or to make decisions in a timely fashion. As a result, all states have passed some type of legislation that requires managed care plans to follow specified grievance, review, and appeal procedures. At a minimum, this legislation requires that a plan inform members of the procedures, usually in writing. There is often a specific period in which a plan must respond to a grievance, particularly when a member needs emergency care. Some states have gone further and require an independent external review process if a member is dissatisfied after going through the plan's grievance and appeal process. The decision of the independent review organization is usually binding on the parties, but it is nonbinding in a few states.\n\n \nany-willing-provider law\n             Any-Willing-Provider Laws. There has been some concern, often by physicians, that managed care organizations unnecessarily limit the access of patients to physicians. As a result, several states have passed an any-willing-provider law. These laws require that HMOs and other networks of medical care providers accept any provider who is willing to agree to the plan's basic terms and fees. Managed care plans have opposed this legislation on the basis that it will prevent them from negotiating for the best possible terms with highly qualified and efficient providers.\n\n             Mandatory POS Options. As is discussed later, closed-panel HMOs have traditionally required that members seek treatment from network providers. Several states have recently adopted legislation that requires managed care organizations to permit members to seek treatment from nonnetwork providers. The managed care organization must pay a portion, but not all, of the expenses incurred with these providers. In effect, such legislation turns a traditional HMO into a POS plan. In some states, this legislation applies only to HMOs with a minimum number of members, such as 10,000. In other states, HMOs must make a POS option available to employer groups above a certain size, such as 25 employees.\n\n             Continuity of Care. One drawback to receiving care through a managed care plan is that continuity of care may be lost if the provider ceases to be a part of the provider network, for whatever reason. Several states have recently addressed this issue through this legislation. For example, one state requires that the managed care plan continue to pay for care for up to 60 days, as long as such a continuation is appropriate. Many of the state laws deal primarily with pregnant patients and may, for example, require coverage to be continued until birth or shortly thereafter for any woman who is in the third trimester of a pregnancy at the time of her obstetrician's departure from the network.\n\n               Provider Protection. Most states now require that managed care plans disclose their criteria for selecting medical care providers, give these providers advance notice of contract termination, and provide them with procedures for contesting the termination. One purpose of this legislation is to address the concern that providers who give quality care might lose their provider contract if this care was more expensive or extensive than that the managed care plan deemed necessary.\n\n               Emergency Room Coverage. Managed care organizations have been criticized for often refusing to pay for emergency room care, claiming that emergency room treatment was unnecessary. For example, some plans do not pay if a member who goes to an emergency room with chest pains is found to have indigestion rather than a heart attack. The majority of states now require that a plan pay emergency room charges whenever a prudent layperson considers a situation to be an emergency. In addition, the emergency room cannot delay care to get plan authorization for treatment.\n\n                Mental Health Parity. Some states have passed mental health parity laws that go beyond what the federal law requires (though federal law is changing) in that they require either complete parity for benefits arising from physical illnesses and mental illnesses or complete parity for physical illnesses and certain severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, depression, or bipolar disorder. These types of laws apply to benefits provided under both traditional insurance contracts and managed care contracts.\n\n                Diabetes Health Benefits. Many states require that insurance contracts or managed care plans pay for certain education, equipment, and supplies required by diabetics. With proper care, diabetics can often avoid many serious complications of the disease, such as blindness, amputations, strokes, heart disease, and kidney disease. It is interesting to note one difference between the passage of the laws for mental health parity and diabetes health benefits. The push for mental health parity was partially\na result of some managed care plans providing more restrictive benefits than many traditional major medical contracts. On the other hand, the diabetes legislation was probably encouraged by the publicity and success of practices adopted by some managed care plans that traditional major medical contracts did not use.\n\n               Minimum Stays for Certain Procedures. As a result of concerns that some HMOs were compromising proper health care by forcing new mothers and their babies to leave the hospital too soon, most states adopted laws requiring coverage of minimum stays for mothers and newborns following deliveries. As a rule, these periods coincide with those required by the federal legislation. Most states also mandate that plans provide coverage for minimum stays following surgery for breast cancer. For example, several states mandate coverage for stays of 48 hours for mastectomies and 24 hours for lymph node dissection.\n\n               Plastic Surgery Mandates. Because of publicity over several cases in which HMOs denied coverage for reconstructive surgery-for example, to deformed children-several states enacted legislation to require all health insurance contracts or health plans to provide coverage for certain types of reconstructive surgery. This legislation may apply to the repair of birth defects only, or it may apply to a broader list of situations in which reconstruction might be needed because of mastectomies, trauma, infections, tumors, or disease.\n\n               Direct Access to Providers. Most states have passed laws to allow women covered under managed care plans to have direct access to obstetricians/gynecologists without obtaining approval or a referral from their health plan. A few states require direct access to other types of providers, such as dermatologists.\n\n               Other Legislation. Other types of legislation have been introduced in several states, but the number of states adopting the legislation has been small to date. Examples include\n\u2022 allowing managed care organizations to be sued for medical malpractice if their denial of medically necessary treatment results in harm or injury to a patient. Under a typical state law, a patient cannot sue a managed care plan for medical malpractice because the plan itself is not considered to be practicing medicine.\n\u2022 requiring that patients and/or state regulators be informed of financial incentives offered to providers\n\u2022 granting patients access to all prescription drugs approved by the government for sale\n\u2022 making health care plans disclose their policies for covering experimental treatments\n\u2022 improving state monitoring of managed care plans by requiring that these plans report the status of patient grievances to the states\n\n\nVoluntary Reform by Managed Care Organizations\n              Managed care organizations voluntarily initiate many managed care reforms. Some reforms are probably a result of the natural evolution of any form of financing and providing health care. Other changes have occurred because of competition among managed care organizations for market share. However, most of the reforms probably are reactions to legislation that is proposed or passed by the states. After a few states pass a certain type of managed care legislation, there is often a tendency for managed care organizations nationwide to revise their plans to address the concerns that resulted in the legislation. There then may be little need for other states to adopt similar legislation, and, in fact, legislatures often do not enact bills if the legislature learns that the managed care industry has already resolved the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCE\n22.

Even an employee who assigns benefits to the provider may still be responsible for filing a claim form (i.e., to give the administrator a record of claims incurred).\n   The adjudication and payment of health and other welfare benefit claims may be handled by an employer that self-administers the plan or by a third party, such as a commercial insurance company or a third-party administrator. Employers may contract for administrative services separately from purchasing insurance and may also include actuarial and marketing services as part of the administrative contract. Few employers undertake paying claims themselves, and most fully insured plans\n(see KB-1 Topic 460) delegate claim processing to the insurer.\n   HMOs and PPOs. HMOs do not require patients to fill out forms to claim benefits because all benefits are prepaid by the monthly premium cost. In addition, some PPOs require providers to submit claims directly to the claim processor. For example, an employee might be billed a small copayment at the time of an office visit and not be required to file a benefit claim. This occurs because the provider agreed to accept as full payment the reimbursement from the sponsor of the PPO.\n"

For COBRA purposes, a qualified beneficiary is generally anyone who is covered under a group health plan on the day before a qualifying event, including the spouse and dependent children of a covered employee.(Reference 1 below)\n\tCovered employees. \"Covered employee\" also includes self-employed persons, agents and independent contractors, and corporate directors. A person who is merely eligible for coverage under a group health plan but has not actually been covered is not a covered employee. Other classes of employees are covered employees under COBRA by virtue of the qualifying event that gives rise to their coverage-such as laid-off or striking employees or Medicare-eligible employees.\n\tNewborn or adopted children. Children born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee on or after the date of a qualifying event are considered qualified beneficiaries. (Reference 2 below)\n\tIf a covered employee who is also a qualified beneficiary does not elect COBRA coverage during the election period, then any child born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee on or after the date of the qualifying event is not considered a qualified beneficiary.(Reference 3 below)\n\tA child is \"placed for adoption\" for this purpose when a covered employee assumes and retains a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in anticipation of the child's adoption.(Reference 4 below)\n\tPart-time employees. Part-time employees are eligible for COBRA coverage if they were covered by the group health care plan and lose coverage due to a qualifying event If part-time employees' families are covered by the group health care plan and lose coverage due to a qualifying event, they may also be eligible for COBRA coverage.\n\tNonresident aliens. The term \"qualified beneficiary\" does not include an individual whose status as a covered employee is attributable to a period when he or she was a nonresident alien who received no earned U.S. source income from an employer. If the individual is not a qualified beneficiary as a result of this nonresident alien rule, the nonresident alien's spouse or dependent child is also not considered to be a qualified beneficiary. (Reference 5 below)\n\nOpen enrollment period\n\n\tIf an employer makes an open enrollment period available to non-COBRA beneficiaries, the same open enrollment period rights must be available to each COBRA qualified beneficiary.(Reference 6 below) An open enrollment period is a period during which an employee covered under a plan can choose to add or eliminate coverage of family members or can choose to be covered under another group health plan.\n\tIn addition to open enrollment periods, if the plan provides that new family members of active employees may become covered prior to the next open enrollment period, then the same right must be extended to a new family member of a COBRA beneficiary who joins the qualified beneficiary's family on or after the date of the qualifying event.(Reference 7 below)\n\nSame-sex marriage\n\tCOBRA benefits must be extended to the same-sex spouse of a covered employee, if the individuals are lawfully married under state law. For this purpose, a marriage is recognized as lawful if it took place in a state whose laws authorize same-sex marriage, even if the married couple lives in a state that does not recognize the validity of same-sex marriage.(Reference 8 below)\n\tTreatment of domestic partners. Health benefits offered to \"domestic partners\" after the breakup of a domestic partnership are not covered by COBRA However, employers may choose to offer continuation coverage to domestic partners of employees. Domestic partners are typically unrelated cohabiting adults, either heterosexual or homosexual. Note that for federal tax purposes, including COBRA coverage, the term \"marriage'' does not include a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar formal relationship recognized under state law that is not called a marriage under the laws of that state.\n\tSimilarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries\n\t\tCOBRA provides that the type of coverage offered to qualified beneficiaries must be the type available to similarly situated beneficiaries with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred.(Reference 9 below)\n\t\t\"Similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries\" refers to the group of covered employees and their spouses or dependent children who:\n\t\t\t1. are receiving coverage under an employer or employee organization group health plan for a reason other than the right to coverage under the requirements of COBRA; and\n\t\t\t2. based on all of the facts and circumstances, are most similarly situated to the situation of the qualified beneficiary immediately before the qualifying event.(Reference 10 below)\n\nPersons wrongfully denied coverage\n\tA person who is wrongfully denied group health plan coverage in violation of an applicable law is to be treated as a qualified beneficiary.(Reference 11 below)\n\tSpecifically, if a person is denied or not offered group health plan coverage in violation of another law1 for purposes of COBRA, that person is considered to have had the coverage that was wrongfully denied or not offered and thus is considered to be a qualified beneficiary.\n \nREFERENCES \n\n1 Code Sec. 4980B(g) (1) (A) and (B).\n2 Code Sec. 4980(B) (g) (1) (A) and ERISA Sec.607(3), as amended by P.L. 104-191.\n3 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-3, Q/A\u00b7l(t).\n4 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-3, Q/A-l(g).\n5 Code Sec. 4980B(g) (1) (C).\n6 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-4(c).\n7 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-5(b) and (c).\n8 Rev.

If an employee dies, becomes incapacitated, loses his or her job or suffers a reduction in work hours, health care coverage can be extended for up to 18 or 36 months, depending on circumstances. \n\n                       The cost of health insurance provided under COBRA is usually high, because the recipient pays the entire premium including the portion that was being paid by the employer. In that sense, COBRA coverage is primarily a stop-gap until less expensive health insurance can be found.\n\n                       To qualify for COBRA coverage, an employee has to have been enrolled in a company-sponsored group health insurance plan on the day before the qualifying event (loss of job, reduced hours, etc.) occurs and the insurance plan must have been in effect on more than 50% of the employer's typical business days during the previous calendar year. ln addition, the employer must still be offering existing employees a group health plan; if the employer stops offering health coverage or goes out of business or drops below 20 employees the employee seeking COBRA coverage may no longer be eligible for extended insurance benefits.\n\n                       Even small employers with less than 20 employees may be required to provide extended insurance coverage to employees who have suffered a qualifying event. Many states have laws similar to COBRA. These \"mini-COBRA\" laws generally apply to employers of all sizes, including those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Introduction to Medical Expense Benefits - National Health Insurance\n\n\tFew issues in recent years have gotten as much attention as the debate over national health insurance. With health care expenditures taking nearly one out of every six dollars spent in this country and with there being more than 50 million uninsured Americans, the magnitude of the problem cannot be overemphasized. There are no easy solutions to the problems of increasing costs and the lack of coverage for everyone. Health care is an emotional issue, and any reform is complex and affects almost all Americans to varying degrees.\n\n\tThe following discussion of national health insurance addresses many aspects of the issue to provide readers with a better understanding of the issues and debates that led to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.\n\nSome Basic Historical Questions\n\n\tThe issue of national health insurance is best addressed by having an understanding of its many dimensions and discussion points.\n\nDon't We Already Have National Health Insurance?\n\n\tThe answer is yes for many Americans. Unlike most other industrialized countries, however, the United States does not have a system of national health insurance that covers everyone. Although national health insurance does exist in the form of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, certain veterans' benefits, and coverage of military personnel and their families, each of these programs addresses the issue of health insurance for a specific group and each takes a different approach.\n\n\tSome people would say that a national health insurance program also covers most other Americans. Although the role of the federal government is probably not extensive enough for most persons to agree with this observation, the federal government does in fact have an influence on the design of employer-provided medical expense plans of almost all employers. This influence comes from numerous pieces of federal legislation, such as ERISA, COBRA, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and HIPAA.\n\n\tSome Americans feel that the federal government should have no role in health care reform. But approximately 50 percent of all medical care expenditures are for persons who are either employees of the federal government or covered under the national health insurance programs previously mentioned. Therefore, the government and the taxpayers who fund its activities have a direct stake in controlling the cost of medical care.\n\nWhat Is the Objective of National Health Insurance?\n\n\tIt is difficult to determine exactly what a national health insurance program should accomplish. Alternative proposals either have different objectives or place varying degrees of emphasis on a combination of objectives. There are two primary concerns with the current health care system-rapidly increasing costs and the lack of coverage for a large segment of the population. Some programs are essentially a proposed solution to only one of these concerns; other proposals address both concerns in varying degrees. It would be much easier to find a solution if there were consensus on the scope of the actual problem.\n\n\tUnfortunately, the two problems are not independent, and solving one problem may actually exacerbate the other. For example, making broad coverage available to everyone might so increase the demand for medical treatment that costs would go up because of a shortage of medical care providers. This situation occurred after the passage of Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, efforts to control costs could lead to rationing of medical care so that some types of care would be available only to the more affluent segment of the population who could afford supplemental insurance protection.\n\nDo Americans Want Reform?\n\n\tThis is a difficult question to answer. During health care debates over the last few years, numerous polls were taken. There seemed to be overwhelming agreement among the American people that the health care system is broken and needs fixing. Some proponents of national health insurance inferred from this opinion that there was support for radical reform.\n\n\tAs the debate continued and more polls about the underlying mood of the public were conducted, a different picture began to emerge. Most Americans were reasonably happy with their own medical expense coverage. They were also aware of rapidly rising costs, but those in managed care plans had been less significantly affected by them. In fact, as many employees elected managed care options, they actually saw their out-of-pocket medical expenses decrease. However, this is changing more recently as managed care plans have increased or added deductibles and increased copayments.\n\n\tAlthough the public was not in favor of changes that would affect their relationships with providers of medical care, a surprisingly large percentage of the public was aware that reform carried a financial cost, and within limits many Americans were willing to foot the bill.\n\n\tThese further surveys also indicated that the major concern of Americans was the lack of security surrounding their own medical expense coverage, particularly if they became unemployed or changed jobs. There was fear that the loss of employment would put them in the category of uninsured. Even if coverage could be continued under COBRA, its high cost would make it unaffordable. Considerable concern was also expressed over the lack of coverage when changing jobs because of preexisting-conditions provisions in the new employer's coverage. These were significant issues addressed by recent major health insurance legislation.\n\n\tOne final observation: These surveys showed that the majority of Americans do not want another program as bureaucratic as they view Medicare to be.\\\n\nIs the Goal Universal Coverage or Universal Access?\n\nUniversal Coverage\n\n\tSome national health insurance programs call for universal coverage, which means that all Americans would be covered. Unfortunately, the cost of universal coverage would be very expensive, and it is questionable whether such a program could be accomplished voluntarily. As long as some people are in a position of voluntarily electing coverage, there are those who would be unwilling to pay the price, even if it were subsidized. Therefore, universal coverage probably requires a program similar to Medicare and accompanying tax revenue to support the program. With the majority of the public wanting a nongovernmental program of health insurance, many other national health insurance proposals focus on universal access and realize that a goal of slightly less than universal coverage is all that is realistically attainable. But even this goal will require subsidies for some segments of the population.\n\nWho Should Pay the Cost?\n\n\tA majority of the uninsured have inadequate resources to pay the cost of voluntary coverage, even if it was suddenly available. As a result, there will be some need to subsidize the cost of coverage if the number of uninsured is going to be reduced substantially. Who pays? The alternatives are many, but they can largely be summed up in one word-taxes. There have been numerous suggestions about the form of these taxes, but in all cases they will fall on some or all taxpayers. These alternatives include general tax revenue, additional Social Security taxes, taxes on cigarettes because smoking is the source of many medical problems, and even taxes on certain employer-provided benefits.\n\n\tThe fact that many of the uninsured do receive medical treatment is sometimes overlooked. Even though uninsured persons may be unable to pay, treatment by hospitals and physicians is usually not denied for serious illnesses or injuries. However, when the hospital or physician writes off a large portion of these bills as uncollectible, the cost is in effect being passed on to those who do pay their bills (usually through insurance) in the form of higher charges than would otherwise be made. In theory, the cost to many individuals or employers will decrease if a larger portion of the population has the resources to pay their own expenses. This is used as the rationale for taxing employers or individuals to pay the cost of providing protection for the uninsured.\n\n\tOne factor that would mitigate the effect of tax increases would be efficiencies in the health care system that would lower costs for everyone. This is one of the goals of the Affordable Care Act as it is being implemented.\n\nWhat Benefits Should Be Available?\n\n\tOne of the major debates in designing a national health insurance program involves the scope of the benefits to include. At one extreme in the debate are those who feel the government should guarantee only a minimum level of health care. Private medical expense insurance or personal resources would be necessary to obtain broader benefits. At the other extreme are those who feel that a comprehensive level of health care should be available to all Americans. This group views complete health care protection as a basic right that belongs to everyone regardless of income.\n\n\tThe current system of health insurance falls somewhere between these two extremes, and this is probably where any ultimate solution lies. Most Americans do not have coverage for long-term care; some have limitations on such benefits as mental health and substance abuse treatments. Plans often limit coverage for prescription drugs. Such limitations exist not because employers see no value in these benefits but because realistic cost constraints dictate the benefits that they provide. Employers cannot afford a medical expense plan that does everything for everyone, and it is questionable whether Americans are willing to pay the cost of a national health insurance program that has such a lofty goal.\n\n\tAnother issue is whether a uniform package of benefits should be available nationwide. Under some proposals, benefits would be determined on a state-by-state basis; under others, the federal government would establish a national benefit standard for the plans of employers. These proposals typically call for the abolishment of state benefit mandates.\n\nDoes Cost Containment Harm Quality?\n\n\tAlthough there are undoubtedly inefficiencies in the health care system, some of these inefficiencies have been addressed in recent years. For example, hospitals, faced with limits on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, have had to operate in a more cost-effective manner. However, future efforts to control costs probably need to be more severe and may come with a high price. Americans arguably have the best and most innovative health care system in the world. Can this quality continue if prices are controlled? Or will it continue only for those who have additional resources to pay? Control of costs, if taken beyond a certain point, will lead to the situation that exists in most countries with national health insurance programs-rationing of medical care. Questions like the following will then need to be answered: Should organ transplants be limited to persons under age 50? Should very expensive health care continue to be provided to premature babies who have a less than 25 percent chance of survival? To what extent should medical treatment be provided to persons with terminal illnesses? Will controls on the cost of prescription drugs eliminate the resources needed to develop the next generation of medicines?\n\nAre Employer Mandates the Proper Approach?\n\nEmployer Mandate\n\n\tNational health care proposals differ with respect to the employer's role in making coverage available to its employees. Some proposals argue for an employer mandate, which would require virtually all employers to make coverage\navailable to employees (including part-time employees) and their dependents and to pay a portion of the cost. Under all such proposals, there are additional programs for the unemployed and subsidies to some employers for whom the cost exceeds a certain limit. However, small employers would be hit hard by most of these proposals and have lobbied against employer mandates. There is some support for the argument that the cost of employer mandates would result in some small employers going out of business unless subsidies accompanied such mandates.\n\n\tOne major argument for employer mandates is that the alternative is a government-run program with its accompanying bureaucracy.\n\nWhat Is the Role of Medicare and Medicaid?\n\n\tMany differences exist over the role of Medicare and Medicaid in health care reform. Although some argue for a single system to cover all Americans, opponents argue that the Medicare and Medicaid programs serve specific groups and are working reasonably well. Why alter the part of the system that is already closest to the concept of universal coverage?\n\n\tNational health insurance proposals were much more likely to fold Medicaid recipients into a new program than they were to include Medicare recipients. This fact reflects the reality that tinkering with Medicare can have grave consequences because of the high turnout of older voters. The Affordable Care Act, as it is being implemented, expands eligibility in Medicaid to those who are below 133 percent of the federal poverty level by eliminating the requirement to have dependent children. Medicare also has several changes being implemented by the act.\n\nPossible Approaches\n\n\tIn a debate like the continuing one occurring over health insurance, new proposals are continually replacing old ones, and those that are around for any length of time undergo revision. For this reason, the discussion is general and describes the following generic approaches that have been discussed in recent years:\n\n\t\t\u2022 managed competition plans \n\t\t\u2022 single-payer plans\n\t\t\u2022 reform on a state-by-state basis \n\t\t\u2022 reform of the current system\n\n\tIt is important to remember that the use of any one of these approaches does not dictate a specific national health insurance plan. Within each approach, there is wide latitude to address many of the issues that discussed in the previous pages.\n\nManaged Competition Plans\n\nManaged Competition\n\nHealth Insurance Purchasing Cooperative (HIPC)\n\n\tThe term managed competition received considerable attention because it was the approach taken by the Clinton administration in designing its initial national health insurance proposal. The basic philosophy behind the idea of managed competition is that competition for medical expense insurance should be based on price rather than on the risk characteristics of those needing coverage. A managed competition plan would create a new type of organization-often referred to as a health insurance purchasing cooperative (HIPC). An HIPC would act as a purchasing agent and negotiate with insurance companies, HMOs, and other providers of medical expense coverage to offer a menu of different insurance plans to employers and individuals who subscribe to the HIPC. In addition to price, subscribers would receive information on each plan's quality of care. Note that some states have now adopted HIPCs. In addition, this is similar to the approach used by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n\n\tUnder most managed care proposals, HIPCs would be established under state regulation, would operate in a specified geographic region, and would not compete with each other. Some proposals require all employers to be subscribers to the HIPC in their area, which would be the only source for providing coverage to employees. To varying degrees, however, most managed competition proposals allow larger employers to establish their own HIPCs for self-funding benefits.\n\n\tAll employers (and also unemployed and self-employed persons) would be eligible for coverage from the HIPC, and there would be no preexisting-conditions provisions for employees. Some proposals use community rating, which would establish a set price per covered person for the plan selected. Other proposals would adjust rates by such factors as age or gender.\n\n\tAlthough individual proposals for national health insurance may vary, there is nothing in the basic idea of managed competition that dictates any specific benefit package, level of employer contribution to the cost of the coverage for employees, or government price controls.\n\n\tThere are many critics of managed competition. Because it involves a fundamental change in the delivery of health care, managed competition has been opposed by many physicians who fear that their ability to treat patients will come under government control. Insurance agents have been particularly vocal because their role would be virtually eliminated. However, there would still be a modest role for benefit consultants to advise employers on the selection of alternative plans under the HIPC. HIPCs are also unappealing to persons who are not already in managed care plans and wish to retain control over their choice of medical practitioners. Employers that operate in many regions would also be required to deal with several HIPCs.\n\n\tManaged competition has also been criticized for creating another level of health care bureaucracy by the formation of HIPCs and the additional regulation that would be needed. It has been suggested that this might also negate the effect of any cost-saving features of the approach.\n\nSingle-Payer Plans\n\n\tSeveral proposals for national health insurance can be categorized as single-payer plans, which is the approach taken in Canada and many European countries. Under a single-payer plan, a single program run by the government automatically covers everyone, and everyone has the same benefit package. Some proposals have a totally federal program; other proposals call for each state to administer the program for its residents, but under specific federal guidelines.\n\n\tSingle-payer plans eliminate the employer's role in providing medical expense benefits to employees. The agent's role is also eliminated unless the plan benefits are at a level where there is a market for supplemental insurance. However, most proposals call for very comprehensive coverage with few if any copayments.\n\n\tMost proposals for a single-payer plan call for the financing of the program through taxes rather than premiums. Although the taxes could take a variety of forms, a Social Security type of payroll tax on both employers and employees is most commonly mentioned.\n\n\tIn some respects, a single-payer plan can be viewed as a Medicare-type program that covers everyone. The single-payer approach, however, goes farther and calls for more government control of medical care. A national health care budget would be established, and reimbursement schedules to providers would be determined at the state or federal level within the constraints of this budget. In addition, the budget would result in the government's exercising controls over the types of treatment available for specific conditions and the extent to which monies would be spent on new technology and medical facilities. In effect, a single-payer plan rejects market forces as the allocator of medical resources and implies that there would be some rationing of medical care under government guidelines.\n\n\tAlthough the broad nature of a single-payer plan would result in additional costs because of increased demand for health care, efficiencies associated with the approach would offset these costs. For example, the claim process would be dramatically streamlined, and marketing costs would virtually disappear. Furthermore, the widespread availability of medical care would probably lead to more preventive care, which would minimize the need for more expensive treatments in the future.\n\n\tMuch of the support for a single-payer approach to the health care problem arises from the perception that Americans have of the Canadian health care system. There is no doubt that many Canadians believe they have a good system, but just as in the United States the system is becoming a subject of national debate. Costs are lower than in the United States, but they are increasing at a rapid rate. Moreover, there is rationing of care, which can lead to lengthy waits to schedule surgeries. As a result, some Canadians come to the United States for treatment that privately insured Americans can receive on demand. These facts, coupled with the American public's concern over bigger government and its bureaucracy, make the adoption of a single-payer approach unlikely.\n\nState Reform\n\n\tUntil the 2008 elections, there was increasing support in Congress for the idea that national health insurance should take the form of a series of state programs rather than a single federal program. This support came from many newer members of Congress who were more amenable to having the states rather than the federal government solve some of the nation's problems. Support also came from some state governors. Some other members of Congress, who might otherwise prefer a federal solution, felt that reform at the state level was preferable to partisan debate at the national level with little chance of any real reform.\n\n\tAs a result of the 2008 elections and a much more liberal Congress, the pendulum has swung back to the federal government playing a major role in health care reform. However, this does not necessarily mean that the solution will not also involve the states. To give the states flexibility in health care reform, it will be necessary for the states to be free of such constraints as ERISA. Without an ERISA preemption, states will be unable to apply reform to employees who are in self-funded plans. Employers who self-fund benefits, particularly those who have been successful with cost containment, will be reluctant to support such a change in federal law because it may ultimately result in increased costs, particularly if a state adopts some type of community rating. Self-funded employers that operate in many states would also be burdened by having to comply with each state's mandates.\n\nReform of the Current System\n\n\tPrior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, 1996 and 1997 saw the most far-reaching federal legislation to affect medical expense insurance in many years. It was clear to all sides that the public strongly supported certain changes. Although the overall result was not a basic restructuring of the health care system, it clearly was significant reform and change.\n\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\n\n\tThe primary piece of health care legislation was the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Although the following contains only a discussion of the act's effect on the increased availability of medical expense coverage, other provisions of the act can be summarized as follows:\n\n\t\t\u2022 increased portability of medical expense coverage \n\t\t\u2022 expansion of eligibility for COBRA benefits\n\t\t\u2022 broader tax deductibility of medical expense premiums for the self-employed\n\t\t\u2022 favorable income tax treatment for long-term care insurance \n\t\t\u2022 requirements for wellness programs\n\t\t\u2022 administrative rules pertaining to privacy, security, and transaction standards for personal health information\n\n\tHIPAA was not the only legislation to affect group medical expense coverage. The Mental Health Parity Act requires that many employers provide increased benefits for mental illnesses. In addition, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act may increase the length of inpatient benefits for childbirth in many cases. The Children's Health Insurance Program has resulted in far fewer children lacking medical expense insurance. It is interesting to note that much of this federal legislation and many recent state health reforms (such as the establishment of HIPCs and small-group legislation) incorporate aspects of the original Clinton proposal for national health insurance.\n\n\tThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act was passed in 2003. This act not only reformed Medicare but also paved the way for the establishment of health savings accounts.\n\n\tThere were many possible aspects of federal reform, and numerous proposals suggested and even introduced in Congress. In late 2008, the Congressional Budget Office prepared a lengthy report identifying 115 specific options and analyzing their effect and cost. The 221-page report, Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals, is available on line at www.cbo.gov./doc.cfm?index=9924.\n\n\tJust a few of the proposals discussed in the report include the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 fostering the formation of association health plans (AHPs). These would allow small employers to band together to purchase medical expense benefits. The plans would be free of state regulation, so that one standard policy could be offered across the country.\n\n\t\t\u2022 imposing a pay-or-play requirement on large employers. In effect, they would be required to either offer their employees medical expense coverage or pay a financial penalty.\n\n\t\t\u2022 establishing a national high-risk pool\n\n\t\t\u2022 establishing a national reinsurance program to provide subsidies to insurers and employers for providing coverage to early retirees\n\n\t\t\u2022 creating a voucher program to expand medical expense coverage\n\n\t\t\u2022 replacing the income tax exclusion for employment-based health insurance with a deduction\n\n\t\t\u2022 expanding eligibility for an above-the line deduction for medical expense insurance premiums\n\n\t\t\u2022 disallowing new contributions to health saving accounts. This option is supported by those who are not in favor of health savings accounts.\n\n\t\t\u2022 allowing health insurance plans with higher coinsurance to be used with health savings accounts. This option has support from some of those who do favor health savings accounts.\n\n\t\t\u2022 raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67\n\n\t\t\u2022 allowing individuals at least age 62 to buy into Medicare\n\n\t\t\u2022 funding research to compare the effectiveness of treatment options\n\n\t\t\u2022 imposing excise taxes on such items as sugar-sweetened beverages and cigarettes to encourage healthier behavior\n\n\t\t\u2022 increasing the look-back period for transfer of assets to Medicaid\n\n\tSeveral of these proposals were incorporated into 201O's health care reform legislation.\n\nIncreased Availability of Medical Expense Coverage\n\n\tHIPAA contains several provisions designed to help both employees and employers obtain coverage more easily. Portions of the act deal with preexisting conditions and the issue of eligibility. The discussion here focuses on the plans covered by the act and portions of the act that address nondiscrimination rules, special enrollment periods, renewability, and small groups.\n\nCovered Plans\n\n\tThe act applies to group health plans that cover two or more employees, whether insured or self-funded. However, the act does not apply to a long list of excepted benefits. The following are excepted benefits in all circumstances:\n\n\t\t\u2022 coverage for accidents, including accidental death and dismemberment\n\t\t\u2022 disability income insurance\n\t\t\u2022 liability insurance\n\t\t\u2022 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance\n\t\t\u2022 workers' compensation or similar insurance \n\t\t\u2022 automobile medical payments insurance\n\t\t\u2022 credit-only insurance, such as mortgage insurance \n\t\t\u2022 coverage for on-site medical clinics\n\n\tIn addition, certain other benefits are excepted benefits under specified circumstances:\n\n\t\t\u2022 limited vision or dental benefits, long-term care insurance, nursing home insurance, home health care insurance, and insurance for community-based care if these benefits are offered separately rather than as an integral part of a medical expense plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 coverage for a specific disease or illness or for hospital or other fixed indemnity insurance if the benefits (1) are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance and (2) are not coordinated with other coverage under a medical expense plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 Medicare supplement insurance or other similar supplemental coverage if the policy is offered as a separate insurance policy rather than as a continuation of coverage under a plan that also covers active employees.\n\n\t\t\u2022 health flexible spending accounts (FSAs) under cafeteria plans as long as (1) the employee has other coverage available under a group health plan of the employer and (2) the maximum payment under the FSA for the year does not exceed the greater of two times the employee's salary reduction or the amount of the employee's salary reduction plus $500. Virtually all FSAs meet these requirements.\n\n\tWith one exception, all employers-including the federal government- must comply with the act's provisions. State and local government plans can elect to be excluded from most of HIPAA's provisions.\n\nNondiscrimination Rules\n\n\tThe act prohibits the use of any of the following health-related factors as a reason to exclude an employee or dependent from coverage under a group health plan or to charge the individual or dependent a higher premium:\n\n\t\t\u2022 health status\n\n\t\t\u2022 medical condition, including both physical and mental condition \n\n\t\t\u2022 claims experience\n\n\t\t\u2022 receipt of health care\n\n\t\t\u2022 medical history\n\n\t\t\u2022 genetic information. (In 2008, Congress passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which further restricted the use of genetic information by employers. Employers will no longer be able to use genetic information to discriminate against an employee with respect to terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. This applies to compensation, which includes all type of employee benefits. Various parts of the act will be implemented in 2009 and 2010.)\n\n\t\t\u2022 evidence of insurability, including conditions caused by domestic violence and participation in such activities as motorcycling, snowmobiling, all-terrain vehicle riding, horseback riding, skiing, and other similar activities\n\n\t\t\u2022 disability\n\n\tIt is important to note that these factors relate to coverage for specific individuals under a plan. The overall plan itself (except for plans in the small-group market, as explained later) can still be subject to traditional underwriting standards. In addition, a group health plan is not required to offer any specific benefits. It can also limit benefit levels or exclude coverage for certain types of injuries as long as any limitations or exclusions apply uniformly to all similarly situated individuals and are not directed at individual participants based on any health factor. However, the act does not prohibit different benefit structures for different groups of employment classifications. Examples of acceptable classifications are full-time versus part-time, different geographic locations, membership in a collective bargaining unit, date of hire, length of service, current employee versus former employee status, and different occupations.\n\n\tThe act does not restrict the amount an insurance company or other provider of health care coverage can charge an employer for coverage. The act does allow an employer or provider of medical expense coverage to establish premium discounts or to modify copayments or deductibles for persons who participate in bona fide programs of health promotion or disease prevention.\n\nSpecial Enrollment Periods\n\n\tFor various reasons, employees and their dependents may elect not to enroll in an employer's plan when they are initially eligible for coverage. For example, a new employee may have coverage under a spouse's plan. The act requires that employers allow these employees and dependents to enroll in the employer's plan under any one of several specified circumstances as long as the employee had previously stated in writing that the original declination was because there was other coverage. However, the requirement of a written declination does not apply unless the employer requires it and notifies the employee that it is a requirement for future coverage. The following are the circumstances for special enrollment:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The other coverage was lost because of loss of eligibility under the other plan. This loss of eligibility can result from such circumstances as divorce, the spouse's termination of employment, or the spouse's death.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The other coverage was lost because employer contributions for the coverage terminated.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The other coverage was COBRA coverage that is exhausted.\n\n\tThe employee has 30 days following the loss of coverage to request enrollment in the employer's plan.\n\n\tIn addition, new dependents (including children placed for adoption) are also eligible for coverage under special enrollment rules. The employee must enroll the dependent within 30 days of his or her gaining dependent status. Coverage for a new spouse must become effective no later than the first month beginning after the employee's request; coverage for children must go into effect as of the date of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.\n\nGuaranteed Renewability\n\n\tAll group health insurers must renew existing health insurance coverage unless one of the following circumstances exists:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The plan sponsor failed to pay premiums or the issuer of health insurance coverage failed to receive timely premiums.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The plan sponsor performed an act of fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The plan sponsor failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules as long as applicable state or federal law permits these rules. For example, an employer might fail to maintain a minimum required percentage of participation under a plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 There is no covered employee who lives or works in the service area of a network plan, such as an HMO.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The employer is no longer a member of the association that sponsors a plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The issuer of coverage ceases to offer coverage in a particular market. The issuer must notify each plan sponsor, participant, and beneficiary at least 90 days prior to the discontinuation of coverage, and the issuer must offer each plan sponsor the option to purchase other health insurance coverage the issuer currently offers to a group health plan in the market. If the issuer exits the market entirely, the period of notice is 180 days, and the issuer cannot reenter the market and sell health insurance coverage for at least 5 years.\n\n\tSimilar rules require multiemployer plans and multiple-employer welfare arrangements to renew coverage for employers. It also establishes guaranteed-issue and renewal rules for the individual marketplace.\n\nGuaranteed Issue for Small-Group Plans\n\n\tWith some exceptions, the act requires that insurers, HMOs, and other providers of health care coverage which operate in the small-group market accept all small employers-defined as employers with 2 to 50 employees-that apply for coverage. In addition, all employees of small employers and their dependents must be accepted for coverage as long as they enroll during the period in which they are first eligible. This rule is in line with the small-group legislation of many states. However, some states have similar rules for groups as small as one employee, and some stipulate an upper limit of 25, above which the small-group legislation does not apply.\n\n\tExceptions to this guaranteed-issue requirement are allowed if a provider of coverage in the small-group market has inadequate network or financial capacity or if applicants are not in a plan's service area.\n\n\tMinimum participation or employer contribution requirements are acceptable if applicable state law permits them.\n\nInterrelationship of State and Federal Legislation\n\n\tFor the most part, the federal legislation does not preempt state laws pertaining to group medical expense insurance (which might be more stringent than HIPAA) except in those situations where any state standard or requirement would prevent the application of the federal law. To prevent any preemption, many states have had to make some modifications to their laws and regulations.\n\n\tThe act permits a state to enforce the act's provisions with respect to insurance companies and other medical expense providers. However, the federal government can take over enforcement if a state does not perform its duties. In that case, enforcement is by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Labor has enforcement power for the act's provisions as they apply to group health plans themselves, including the act's portability provisions. When there is federal enforcement, the penalty for noncompliance can be up to $100 per day for each individual with respect to whom a plan or issuer is in noncompliance.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Reasons for Use of Managed Care\n\n                There are many reasons why employees elect coverage under a managed care plan. First, it may be the only plan the employer provides, although most employers allow a choice of benefit plans. In those situations, the following factors have been identified as reasons why an employee might select a managed care plan, in general, or a particular managed care plan:\n\u2022 the reputation of the managed care plan. To some extent, this is a function of the managed care plan's experience. In areas where there have been managed care plans for many years, a larger percentage of employees participate. Employees are also concerned with perceived quality of care and are less likely to\nchoose a plan known for frequent coverage denials and difficulty in obtaining referrals to specialists.\n\u2022 the extent to which employees have established relationships with physicians. Employees are reluctant to elect a managed care option if it requires that they give up a physician with whom they are satisfied. In some cases, of course, this physician may also participate in the managed care plan. In general, new employees are more likely to elect a managed care option if they are new residents of the area or are just entering the labor force.\n\u2022 costs. Managed care plans are obviously more attractive to employers when they offer a less expensive alternative to coverage under insurance company plans. As a rule, managed care plans are less expensive, and any employee share of the premium is lower. Even when the premium cost is comparable, there is often broader coverage and no deductibles or percentage participation. If employees view a managed care alternative as being less expensive in the long run, their participation is greater.\n\n               In the early days of the growth of managed care, employers were concerned primarily with cost savings when they adopted managed care plans. In a more mature managed care marketplace, employers are concerned with the same factors when they change plans as are employees: reputation, availability of providers, and cost. Throughout most of the late 1990s, the economy was booming, labor markets were tight, and employers faced relatively modest premium increases from year to year. As a result, employers were much more likely than in the past to modify managed care plans or to adopt new plans that were less restrictive, and therefore somewhat more expensive, in their management of care. With greater premium increases and a downturn in the economy, this trend is reversing."

Of prime importance in any discussion of medical benefits is the subject of cost containment-a topic so important today that it is referred to, either explicitly or implicitly, in all the chapters in this section.\n          Part Two opens with a discussion of the basic designs and strategic consideration of health plans in KB-2 Chapter 4. The next three chapters all deal in one way or another with recent ways of dealing with health care cost containment. Chapter 5 covers demand-side approaches to cost containment, KB-2 Chapter 6 deals with managing and measuring care management intervention programs, and KB-2 Chapter 7 examines consumer-driven health care plans. The focs of Chapter 8 is behavioral health care benefits, and KB-2 Chapter 9 describes how to evaluate the quality of health care provided by plans-quality has tremendous impact on both treatment outcomes and plan costs.\n          The next four chapters expand the coverage of health benefits to four specific benefits. KB-2 Chapter 10 discusses the problem of high prescription drug costs and plan designs found to curtail plan cost increases. Dental benefits, which are much valued by employees and require only a modest employer investment, are covered in KB-2 Chapter 11. Long-term care insurance is the topic of KB-2 Chapter 12. Finally, completing this series of chapters, Chapter 13 deals with disability income benefits.\n"

(Reference 1 below) Insurers also are required to \"prominently\" post information regarding premium increases on their websites.\n   \tHHS, again in conjunction with the states, is required to monitor premium increases of health insurance coverage offered both inside and outside the Ameri\u00ad can Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) (see KB-1 Topic 860). (Reference 2 below)\n   \tIn determining whether to exercise its option to permit large employers to participate in the Exchange, a state must consider any excess of premium growth outside the Exchange as compared to the rate of such growth inside the Exchange.\n   \tRate review process. A new rate process in HHS regulations requires health insurers to submit to the HHS and the applicable state a justification for an \"unreasonable\" premium increase prior to the implementation of the increase. (Reference 3 below)\n   \tReasonable increase does not exceed 15 percent. HHS concludes that premium rate increases under 15 percent are reasonable. Thus, for rate increases filed for policy or plan years beginning in 2019, in a state that does not require rate increases to be filed, the threshold for whether rates are subject to review would be whether the average weighted increase in the rate filing, alone or in combination with prior increases in the preceding 12 month period, is 15 percent or more. (Reference 4 below) The default threshold for rate increases subject to review was 10 percent prior to 2019.\n   \tDisclosure notices. Related to the rate increase regulations are proposed consumer disclosure notices, which include an easy-to-understand breakdown of an insurer's proposed rate increase-helping make sure that, as the rate increase is being reviewed, consumers who would be affected by the increase have access to information about their insurance rates. The notices provide basic information about health insurance rate increases and their review, as well as detailed information about the specific increase that an insurer has proposed. Consumers also will be able to see what the insurance company believes is driving the increase in premiums and how much of the increase would go to medical services, profits, and administrative expenses.\n\tThe proposed notices require health insurers to advise consumers of the insurer's products affected by the rate increase, the average dollar increase and monthly rate that would result from the proposed rate adjustment, range of percentage increase depending on individual factors, when the new rate would be effective, and how many people in the state would be affected.

This premium is determined by the HMO for the geographic area and includes all health care costs that an employer needs to pay during the year.\n   Pointer: This HMO premium also includes the costs of wellness and preven\u00ad tive medicine that HMOs often sponsor.\n   If costs are lower. If the actual costs are lower than the premiums, the HMO keeps the difference.\n   If costs are higher. However, if the actual costs are higher than the yearly premiums, the HMO is at risk and pays the difference and may increase premiums the following year to make up the difference.\n\nAdvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, there is security in knowing what health care costs are; an employer is protected from catastrophic claims and can budget its costs.\n   The HMO usually does not require claims to be submitted, but rather simply provides the coverage for the pre-established rate.\n   HMOs offer a managed care approach to health care that may result in a lower monthly cost than other insurance arrangements.\n\nDisadvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, the employer has lost flexibility and has tied up its funds. It must also pay the HMO's margin cost that represents its profit and marketing costs.\n   The premium paid to the HMO is not based on the risk characteristics of the employer's own employee group but rather on all people in the geographic area who participate in the HMO. This is because HMOs use community rating (see KB-1 Topic 430). Premium increases for subsequent years are also based on costs incurred by the whole membership.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Group Insurance Pricing - Manual Rating\n\n\tIn the manual-rating process, insurance companies establish premium rates only for broad classes of group insurance business, and they do not consider the past claims experience of a particular group when determining that group's rates. However, claims experience is not entirely ignored, because insurers use the aggregate claims experience for a class of business to determine the premium rates for that class.\n\tInsurers use manual rating with small groups for which no credible individual loss experience is available. This lack of credibility exists because the group's size makes it impossible to determine whether other-than-average loss experience is due to random chance or is truly reflective of the group. Manual rating is also frequently used to determine the initial premiums for groups that are subject to experience rating, particularly when a group's past experience is unobtainable or when a group is being written for the first time. In addition, experience rating typically uses a weighting of manual rates and the actual experience of a group to determine the premium. (Rates for very large groups may be based solely on a group's own experience.)\n\nRating Basis\n\tPrior to the actual calculation of manual premium rates, insurers develop a basis on which the rates are determined. This rating basis involves a decision regarding (1) what benefit unit to use, (2) the extent to which rates are refined by factors affecting claims, and (3) the frequency with which premiums are paid.\n\nBenefit Unit\n\tSubject to certain adjustments, insurers calculate the premium for a group by multiplying the premium rate by the number of benefit units provided. Although variations do occasionally exist, the benefit units predominantly used for the most common types of group insurance are shown in the following table.\n\nTable 15-1 Benefit Units\nType of Group Insurance\tBenefit Unit\nTerm life (including accidental death and dismemberment)\nShort-term disability income Long-term disability income\nMedical expense (including dental)\tEach $1,000 of death benefit\nEach $10 of weekly income Each $100 of monthly income\nEach employee and each category of dependents\n\nFactors Affecting Claims\n\tRates reflect those factors that result in different claims experience for different groups. Although there are variations among insurance companies, the following discussion indicates the factors used by most insurance companies to determine rates for life, disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance.\n\tGender. Gender of insured persons is taken into account for determining rates for all the types of insurance mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\tAge. Age is also used as a rating factor for life insurance, disability income, and medical expense insurance. Dental insurance rates usually do not take age into consideration.\n\tGeographic Location. At one time, geographic location was a rating factor for medical expense insurance and dental insurance only. However, an increasing number of insurance companies use geographic variations for determining life insurance and disability income insurance rates. For these latter types of insurance, rates may not be determined separately for a wide variety of locations. Instead, the insurance company may have only two or three rate schedules, with each schedule applying to several different geographic locations on the basis of past experience.\n\tOccupation. Occupation is virtually always reflected in both life insurance rates and accidental death and dismemberment rates. It may also be reflected in disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance rates. Some companies ignore it as a rating factor but may not write coverage when certain occupations are involved.\n\tIncome. At one time, the income level of group members was commonly used as a factor in establishing disability income, medical expense, and dental insurance rates. Currently, income level is still a factor in determining dental insurance premiums, but it is more likely to be an underwriting consideration only in disability income and medical expense insurance.\n\tSize. The size of a group also affects rates because the proportion of the premium needed for expenses decreases as the size of a group increases. All manual premium rates are based on an assumption that the size of a group falls within a certain range. If the size of a group varies from this range, insurers make an appropriate rate adjustment to reflect this differential. In addition, many insurers reserve the right to rerate a group during the period of the contract or cancel the contract at renewal if the group changes in size by a certain percentage. This is particularly important in an era of downsizing and mergers.\n\tTime. A final factor considered in the calculation of rates is the length of time for which the rates will be in effect. This is a concern primarily for coverages that involve medical and dental claims, which over time are expected to increase in severity because of inflation. In inflationary times, monthly rates that are guaranteed for three months can be lower than those guaranteed for one year.\n\nFrequency of Premium Payment Period\n\tBecause employers usually pay group insurance premiums monthly, insurers generally determine rates for this period. When premiums can be paid less frequently (such as annually), they are usually slightly lower than the sum of the monthly premiums for the same period of coverage. This results from the extra investment earnings the insurer can get by collecting premiums earlier. In addition, the annual expense of processing premiums is lower if employers pay them less frequently.\n\nCalculation of Manual Premium Rates\nmanual premium rate\nfinal premium rate\n\tManual rating involves the calculation of the manual premium rate (also called tabular rate), which is quoted in an insurance company's rate book. The manual rate is applied to a specific group insurance case in order to determine a final premium rate (sometimes called an average premium rate) that is then multiplied by the number of benefit units to obtain a premium for the group.\n\tThere are three manual-rating methods. However, if identical assumptions are used, each method should result in approximately the same premium for any given group. The first method determines separate manual rates for groups with certain characteristics that an insurance company feels affect claims experience. A second approach establishes a single \"standard manual rate\" that is adjusted in the premium-calculation process to compensate for any characteristics that deviate from those of the standard group. A third method merely combines the first two approaches and considers some factors in determining the manual rate and other factors in determining the final premium rate.\n\nnet premium rate\n\tThe first step in the calculation of manual premium rates is the determination of the net premium rate, which is the amount necessary to support the cost of expected claims. For any given classification, the net premium rate is calculated by multiplying the probability (frequency) of a claim occurring by the expected amount (severity) of the claim. For example, if the probability that an employee aged 50 will die in the next month is .0005, then the net monthly premium for each $1,000 of coverage is .0005 x $1,000, or $.50. Because insurers collect premiums before claims are paid, they adjust this figure downward for anticipated interest earnings on these funds.\n\tIn general, insurance companies that write a large volume of any given type of group insurance rely on their own experience in determining the frequency and severity of future claims. Insurance companies that do not have enough past data for reliable future projections can turn to many sources for useful statistics. Probably the major source is the Society of Actuaries (Web site: soa.org), which regularly collects and publishes aggregate data on the group insurance business that is written by a number of large group insurance companies. Other sources of information are industry trade organizations and various agencies of the federal government.\n\nrisk charge\n\tThe second and final step in the calculation of manual premium rates is the adjustment of the net premium rates for expenses, a risk charge, and a contribution to surplus. Expenses include commissions, premium taxes, claims settlement costs, and other costs associated with the acquisition and servicing of group insurance business. The risk charge represents a contribution to the insurance company's contingency reserve as a cushion against unanticipated and catastrophic amounts of claims. The contribution to surplus or net worth represents the profit margin of the insurance company. Although mutual companies are legally nonprofit, they, like stock insurance companies, require a contribution to net worth that is a source of financing for future growth.\n\tFrom the standpoint of equity, the adjustment of the net premium rate is complex. Some factors, such as premium taxes and commissions, vary with the premium charge. However, the size of a group does not affect the premium tax rate, whereas the commission rate generally decreases as the size of a group increases. To a large degree, the expenses of settling claims vary with the number, and not the size, of claims. It costs just as much administratively to pay a $10,000 claim under a group life insurance plan as it does to pay a $100,000 claim. Certain other costs also tend to be fixed regardless of the size of a group. For simplicity, some insurance companies adjust or load their net premium rates by a constant percentage. However, other insurance companies consider the different patterns of expenses by using a percentage plus a constant charge. For example, if the net premium rate is $.60, this might be increased by 20 percent plus $.10 to arrive at a manual premium rate of $.82 (that is, $.60 x 1.2 + $.10). Because neither approach adequately accounts for the difference in expenses as a result of a group's size, another adjustment based on the size of the group is made in the calculation of the final premium rate.\n\nCalculation of Premiums\n\tProbably the best way to explain the actual calculation of group insurance premiums is through examples. The following analysis begins with group term life insurance, then discusses how the structure of manual premium rates and the premium calculation process differ for certain other types of group insurance.\n\nGroup Term Life Insurance\n\tThe mechanics of calculating a final premium rate and the premium for a particular group vary among insurance companies because of the differences in methods of preparing manual premium rates and the process by which insurers make adjustments to these rates.\n\tThe following example begins with the table below, which is an abbreviated version of a set of rates on a monthly basis per $1,000 of coverage at selected ages. As with most rate tables, the ages are those at a person's attained age (nearest birthday).\n\tThese rates are loaded for expenses, and they assume that the coverage contains a waiver-of-premium provision on disabled lives, accidental death and dismemberment coverage, and a conversion privilege. Consequently, rates are higher than if none of these additional benefits were included. When an employee converts coverage to an individual policy, a charge is assessed against the group insurance business of an insurance company to reflect the increased death claims that result from adverse selection on conversions. The amount of this assessment (commonly $50 to $75 per $1,000 of converted insurance) is transferred to the individual insurance department of the company to compensate it for having to write the converted business at too low a rate.\n\nTable 15-2 Term Insurance Rates\nAge at Nearest Birthday\t\nMale Rate\t\nFemale Rate\n20\t$0.16\t$0.10\n25\t0.18\t0.11\n30\t0.21\t0.12\n35\t0.24\t0.15\n40\t0.37\t0.21\n45\t0.48\t0.30\n50\t0.81\t0.48\n55\t1.24\t0.75\n60\t1.87\t1.12\n65\t2.83\t1.70\n70\t4.35\t2.52\n\n\tThe premium-calculation process starts with the determination of an \"unadjusted cost,\" based on a census of the covered employees and the manual rates. For example, assume a firm has 230 employees. For the sake of simplicity, also assume that each of these employees has $25,000 of life insurance and that the group has the age distribution shown in the next table.\n\nTable 15-3 Age Distribution\nAge\tMales\tFemales\n25\t20\t30\n30\t0\t30\n35\t10\t30\n40\t30\t10\n45\t30\t10\n50\t20\t10\n\n\tThe unadjusted cost is then calculated as shown in the following table.\n\nTable 15-4 Calculation of Unadjusted Cost\nAmount of\nNumber\tCoverage\tUnadjusted\nof\t(in\tRate (per\tUnadjusted\nAge  Gender  Employees\tThousands)\tThousand)\tCost\n25\tM\t20\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t$0.18\t$ 90.00\n35\tM\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.24\t60.00\n40\tM\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.37\t277.50\n45\tM\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.48\t360.00\n50\tM\t20\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.81\t405.00\n25\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.11\t82.50\n30\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.12\t90.00\n35\tF\t30\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.15\t112.50\n40\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.21\t52.50\n45\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.30\t75.00\n50\tF\t10\tX\t\t25\tX\t\t0.48\t120.00\n\t\t\t\tTotal\tunadjusted\tcost\t\t$1,725.00\n\n\tThe second step is to reduce the sum of the unadjusted cost by a percentage based on the volume of a group insurance plan as determined by its monthly premium. This reduction results from the fact that the expenses associated with a group insurance plan decrease on a percentage basis as the size (premium volume) of the plan increases. The next table shows the reductions used in this example (for selected monthly premiums).\n\nTable 15-5 Premium Reductions\nPremium before Reduction\tPercentage Expense Reduction\nUnder $200\t0%\n200-249\t\n\n1,000-1,499\t\n6\n1,500-1,999\t7\n\n60,000-79,999\t\n19\n80,000 and over\t20\n\n\tThus, the initial monthly premium for the group in this example is calculated as follows:\n\nUnadjusted cost\t$1,725.00\nMinus expense reduction (7 percent)\t-120.75\nAdjusted monthly premium\t$1,604.25\n\n\tThe initial monthly premium is also used to calculate the final monthly premium rate per $1,000 of protection for the group:\n\n.\t\tAdjusted monthly premium premium\t-=--------...C.\t:.--\u00ad\nTotal volume(in thousands)\n$1,604.25\n(230 X $25.000)/$1,000\n= $1,604.25\n5750\n= $0.28\n\n\tThis final monthly premium rate (usually rounded to either the nearest cent or one-tenth of a cent) is used throughout the first policy year and is multiplied each month by the amount of insurance in force to calculate the monthly premium due. Adjustments to the final monthly premium rate because of changes in the makeup of employees by age or gender are not made until the beginning of the next policy year as part of the renewal process. Insurance companies generally guarantee the initial rate for at least one year, assuming that there is no change in the benefit structure of the plan. However, 2- and 3-year rate guarantees are not unusual.\n\tManual rates are designed so that insurance companies can write policies for businesses in most industries at those rates. However, they may charge higher rates for employers in industries that they considered hazardous.\nThese increased rates are usually in the form of a surcharge per $1,000 of coverage that is added to the unadjusted cost before the expense reduction percentage is applied. For example, an industry that is expected to have about one death claim per year per 1,000 employees in excess of those assumed in the manual rates might be charged for this excess mortality with a surcharge of $.06 per $1,000 of coverage per month.\n\tTherefore, the adjusted monthly premium is calculated as shown below:\n\nUnadjusted cost\t$1,725.00\nPlus industry surcharge\t+ 345.00\nTotal cost before expense reduction\t$2,070.00\nMinus expense reduction (8 percent)\t- 165.60\nAdjusted monthly premium\t$1,904.40\n\n\tSimilarly, the expectation of two extra death claims per year would result in an added premium of $.12 per $1,000 per month, or $690.\n\tVariations for Large Groups. Insurance companies use the premium\u00ad calculation process discussed above for most groups over a certain size, usually from 10 or more to 50 or more lives, but variations do exist. For example, some insurance companies do not incorporate a charge for a waiver of premium or accidental death and dismemberment coverage into their manual rates. Rather, an extra charge, which usually differs by industry, is added for this coverage. Also, some companies use (and are required to use in a few states) manual rates that vary by age but not gender. These unisex rate tables are based on assumptions about the ratio of males to females in the group. However, insurers usually make an adjustment the premium-calculation process if the actual group ratio differs from this assumption.\n\tSome companies incorporate a level of expenses into their manual rate so that there is no expense reduction for a certain-size group. In the final premium-calculation process, an adjustment is made; larger groups receive an expense reduction and smaller groups receive an expense surcharge. The following is one such table of adjustments.\n\nTable 15-6 Premium Adjustments\nMonthly Premium before Adjustment\tPercentage Adjustment\nUnder $200\t+25%\n200-249\t+22\n\n700-799\t\n+1\n800-999\t0\n\n50,000-74,999\t\n-14\n75,000 and over\t-15\n\n\tVariations for Small Groups. The manual-rating process for small groups, including those written by multiple-employer trusts, differs from that of large groups in several ways. In general, insurers band the manual rates by age, typically in 5-year intervals. The following table is an example of one such monthly rate table for each $1,000 of coverage.\n\nTable 15-7 Banded Rates\nAge at Nearest Birthday\tMale Rate\tFemale Rate\nUnder 30\t$0.24\t$0.10\n30-34\t0.24\t0.13\n35-39\t0.25\t0.15\n40-44\t0.36\t0.20\n4 9\t0.58\t0.36\n50-54\t0.91\t0.54\n55-59\t1.55\t0.79\n60-64\t1.93\t1.02\n65--69\t3.30\t1.81\n70 and over\t6.80\t3.23\n\n\tAn unadjusted cost is developed based on a census of the employees by age and by gender unless unisex rates are used. Because the manual rates are loaded for most expenses, and because the groups written tend to be reasonably close in size, typically no adjustment for size is made. However, to compensate for the expenses of periodic billings, most insurance companies apply a flat fee to all groups, commonly between $10 and $20 per billing. Some companies do not levy this charge if the premium is paid annually. To reflect the administrative costs associated with record keeping, some insurance companies also levy a modest one-time expense charge when a plan adds coverage for a new employee.\n\tFor large groups, the initial monthly premium is used to determine a monthly premium rate that applies for a specified period. In contrast, the monthly premium rate for small groups may be recalculated each month based not only on the volume of insurance but also on changes in the makeup of employees by age and gender (unless unisex rates are used), just as if the group were being newly written. However, most insurance companies do guarantee that the manual rates used when the group was initially written (and any future manual rates applicable to the group) remain applicable for some period, with 12 months being common.\n\nAccidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance\n\tAccidental death and dismemberment insurance is usually not written as a separate coverage unless coverage is voluntary. Rather, it is added by an endorsement to a group term insurance contract. A single manual rate typically applies to all employees regardless of age or gender, but it varies depending on whether coverage is written (1) for nonoccupational accidents only or (2) on a 24-hour basis for both nonoccupational and occupational accidents. The rate for nonoccupational coverage generally does not vary by industry and ranges from $.02 to $.05 per $1,000 of principal sum per month. However, the rate for coverage on a 24-hour basis does vary by industry, and although it falls within this same range for low-risk industries, it may be several times higher for hazardous ones. Some companies calculate a separate cost for the accidental death and dismemberment coverage and add it to the charge for the group term life insurance. However, most employers purchase accidental death and dismemberment coverage. As a result, other insurance companies incorporate the cost into the manual rates for group term life insurance, making the principal sum equal to the amount of life insurance protection purchased, and an additional charge is levied only if the employer desires a higher level of accidental death and dismemberment coverage.\n\nDependent Life Insurance\n\tDependent life insurance may be added as additional coverage to a group life insurance contract that provides protection for employees. Because dependent life insurance coverage is usually a modest fixed amount (such as $2,000 on the spouse and $1,000 on each child) that generates a relatively small additional premium, insurers tend to use a very simplified rate structure. However, several variations do exist. Some insurance companies have\na single flat rate, independent of the type or number of dependents, for each employee who has dependent coverage. Other companies have two separate flat rates: one for the spouse's coverage and the other for children's coverage. The rate for the children's coverage is a family rate regardless of the number of children, and it is based upon an average-sized family.\n\tFlat rates are based on the assumption that the group has an average age mix of employees. If the group of employees is older than average, the flat rate for dependent coverage may be adjusted (particularly when it applies to spouses) to reflect the likelihood that the dependents are also above average in age when compared to the dependents of most other groups. A flat rate is commonly used when employees pay the entire cost of dependent coverage. The uniform charge is easy to communicate to employees, and it simplifies the payroll-deduction process for the employer.\n\tSome insurance companies also use a rate for dependent coverage that varies with the employee's age, thereby assuming that older employees have older dependents. Basing the rate on the employee's age may seem illogical, but it is administratively simpler and less expensive than having to determine the ages of dependents. A single variable rate may apply to the total family coverage for the spouse and all children, or it may apply only to the spouse. In this latter case, a flat rate is generally used if coverage for children is also provided.\n\tIt is becoming less common to see dependent life insurance added to the basic group life coverage for an employee. Instead, this coverage is more frequently being written as an employee-pay-all voluntary benefit, with higher amounts of coverage available.\n\nShort-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\tIn addition to varying by age, by gender, and possibly by geographic location, manual rates for short-term disability income insurance also differ according to (1) the maximum benefit period, (2) the length of the waiting period, and (3) the writing of coverage either on a 24-hour basis or only for nonoccupational disabilities.\nSome insurance companies (particularly those for small groups) have only a single standard short-term disability income plan that they sell, and therefore they only need a single manual rate table. On the other hand, some companies allow the employer to exercise a degree of flexibility in designing the plan. Rather than make adjustments to a single rate table, these companies usually have several rate tables. These tables vary by such factors as maximum benefit period (such as 13 or 26 weeks) and waiting period (such as 7 days for all disabilities or 7 days for illnesses and no waiting period for injuries). If they allow any other variations, they make appropriate rate adjustments.\n\tInsurers adjust for the nature of the industry the group represents. Ignoring the occupational injuries and diseases that are covered under workers' compensation, a few occupations are still characterized by higher-than-average disability income claims. As an alternative to a rate adjustment, some insurance companies have underwriting standards that prohibit the writing of coverage for these groups.\n\tUntil the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and various state laws, it was common for insurance companies to have one manual rate for plans that did not provide benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities and another for plans that did provide such benefits. Because most employers can no longer exclude pregnancy as a cause of disability, insurers usually do not publish rates for coverage without this benefit, except for the employers of small groups that still have an option regarding this benefit in many states.\n\tIn contrast to group life insurance rates, which are lower for females than for males, disability income rates are higher for females. Ignoring pregnancy-related disabilities, the claims of females at younger ages still somewhat exceed those of males. However, because male and female claims are comparable at older ages, the rates for later years seldom vary. The following table, which illustrates one insurance company's monthly manual rates per $10 of weekly benefit for 26 weeks following a 7-day waiting period, shows how this rate differential is even more pronounced at younger ages if maternity coverage is included.\n\nTable 15-8 Disability Income Rates\nAge\tMale\tFemale\nUnder 30\t$0.48\t$1.25\n30-34\t0.52\t1.25\n35-39\t0.56\t1.25\n40-44\t0.72\t1.21\n45-49\t0.81\t1.21\n50--54\t1.01\t1.31\n55-59\t1.21\t1.53\n60--64\t1.61\tl.61\n65-69\t2.01\t2.01\n70 and over\t2.16\t2.16\n\n\tIn the past, it was common for short-term disability income rates to be expressed on the basis of each $10 of weekly benefit. This is probably still the norm, but some insurance companies are now expressing their rates in terms of a higher weekly benefit, such as $50 or $100.\n\nLong-Term Disability Income Insurance\n\tLike short-term disability income rates, the manual rates for long-term coverage vary by age, gender, the length of the benefit period, the length of the waiting period, and possibly geographic location. In addition, the\nmanual rates reflect the fact that benefits are coordinated with Social Security and certain other disability income benefits for which an employee might be eligible. To the extent that insurers allow variations in the coordination provision that was assumed in developing the manual rates, they adjust the premium-calculation process. As is also the case with short-term rates, insurers might adjust for certain occupations.\n\tUnlike short-term disability income rates, which are commonly expressed on the basis of a weekly benefit, long-term rates are typically expressed on the basis of a monthly benefit, usually per $100. Unlike the coverages previously discussed, long-term disability claims fluctuate with general economic conditions. Consequently, insurance companies review and possibly revise their manual rates (and/or their underwriting standards) as economic conditions change.\n\tThe period for which insurers guarantee rates may vary from one to 3 years, depending on the industry in which the employees work.\n\nMedical Expense Insurance\n\tIn many ways, the manual rates for medical expense insurance (and also for dental insurance) are similar to those for disability income insurance because variations exist by age, gender, and the provisions of the plan, including the size of the deductible, the coinsurance percentage, and the level of benefits. Most providers of medical expense coverage have manual rates for the few standard plans that they sell, and only large employers have the flexibility to deviate from these plans. Adjustments to the manual rates reflect any such deviation. Insurers may also adjust manual rates if the employer is in an industry that has higher-than-average claims.\n\tOne other factor, geographic location, is always a variable in the manual rates because of the significant differences in medical costs across the country. Depending on group size, insurers may adjust for location in one of two ways. For large groups, the rating process usually starts with a manual rate that does not consider the location of employees. Each county (or other geographic subdivision) where coverage is written is then assigned a factor that is based on the cost of health care in that location compared with the \"average\" cost that is assumed in the manual rates. For example, if Seattle were 20 percent higher than average, it would have a factor of 1.2. If all of a firm's employees are there, the manual rates for that group is multiplied by a location factor of 1.2 in the process of determining the group's premium. If employees are in several locations, a composite factor is calculated as shown in the following table. Consequently, the manual rate for this group is increased by 5.5 percent because of the employees' locations.\n\nTable 15-9 Calculation of Location Factor\n\tNumber of\tLocation\nLocation\tEmployees\tFactor\tProduct\nSeattle\t100\tX\t1.2\t120\nKansas City\t70\tX\t1.0\t70\nBirmingham\t30\tX\t0.7\t21\n200\t211\n\nLocation Factor Total product ---= 211 =1055\n=----'----\t-\nTotal number of employees\t200\n\n\tInsurers use a slightly different approach for small groups. Because employees are usually in one location, many insurers have manual rate tables for between 10 and 20 rating territories, and they assign a specific territorial rating to each geographic area in which employees are located. The following territorial classifications are from the rating manual of one insurance company for some areas in four of the states where it writes business. The first three digits of the zip code identify these areas.\n\nGeorgia\n301-302, 311\t8\n303-304, 308-310, 312-319\t7\nall others\t6\nMichigan\n482\t10\n480,483\t8\n481\t6\n484-485,488-489\t3\nall others\t2\nTennessee\n370-372\t4\nall others\t3\nUtah\nentire state\t1\n\n\tThe next table, an excerpt from the manual rate tables of another company, shows how the monthly cost for coverage under one of its PPO plans varies by geographic area within a single state.\n\nTable 15-10 Medical Expense Rates\nEmployee's\nAge\t\nClass of Coverage\t\nArea 1\t\nArea 2\t\nArea 3\t\nArea 4\n30-39\tEmployee\t$248\t$305\t$335\t$ 459\n30-39\tEmployee and spouse\t404\t495\t551\t793\n30-39\tEmployee and children\t436\t535\t576\t791\n30-39\tFamily\t708\t856\t940\t1,331\n50-59\tEmployee\t448\t525\t523\t690\n50-59\tEmployee and spouse\t779\t915\t934\t1,228\n50-59\tEmployee and children\t606\t718\t743\t990\n50-59\tFamily\t968\t1,139\t1,205\t1,652\n\n\tThis excerpt lists manual rates for dependent coverage that the insurer applies regardless of the number of children or the ages of the dependents. For any size group, this is one of several possible methods for pricing dependent coverage. Another method uses rates that vary by the number of children. Some rating structures also take the ages of dependents into consideration.\n\tBecause medical expense claims are continually increasing as a result of inflation, a trend factor must be applied to past claims experience when manual rates are developed. This is often difficult for employers to\nunderstand. It is also a complex and often perplexing task for most providers of medical expense coverage. Not only has the overall cost of medical care increased faster than the general cost of living (as measured by the consumer price index), but the increases have been erratic from year to year and are virtually impossible to predict with any degree of accuracy. To complicate matters further, these increases vary significantly for each category of medical expenses; therefore, insurers must apply different trend factors to different categories of claims.\n\tAt one time, insurers guaranteed group insurance premium rates for at least 12 months and possibly for as long as 2 or 3 years. However, to protect themselves against unexpected increases in claims because of increases in the cost of medical care, some insurance companies now guarantee medical expense rates for no more than 6 months. In fact, a number of multiple-employer trusts have only 3-month guarantees, or they contain provisions whereby rates can be increased at any time, provided the insurer gives notice of the rate increase 30 or 60 days in advance. Some companies allow an employer to select the length of the rate guarantee, such as 6 months or one year. However, the longer the rate guarantee, the higher the rate.\n\nDental Insurance\n\tAlthough the rating of dental insurance is similar in many ways to the rating of medical expense insurance, there are some significant differences. Most insurance companies do not vary their manual rates by the ages of group members. Instead, an adjustment is often made for the income levels of employees, because higher-paid persons are much more likely to obtain dental care. This adjustment is usually in the form of a percentage based on the extent to which the portion of employees with incomes higher than some figure (such as $30,000) exceeds the proportion of such employees that is assumed in the manual rates. There is also an adjustment for certain occupations (such as salespeople or teachers) that use dental services more frequently than average. Finally, insurers usually increase the manual rates when a plan is new (or expands benefits) if the employees have been informed of the change beforehand. Under these circumstances, there is a tendency to postpone needed dental care until the new plan is in effect.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 515 - Health Benefits - Health Plan Administration - Benefit Denial Procedures\n\n   There are many reasons why a claim might be denied. For example, the services may not be covered by the benefit plan. Another common reason for denial is that the treatment is experimental. The plan maximum benefit level may have been reached. The individual may not be eligible under the plan because he or she has not worked for the employer for the required number of days. Denial can also occur when the claimant has a preexisting condition that precludes coverage until a specified exclusion period has passed.\n   If a claim is denied. When a claim is denied, the plan administrator must provide the claimant with the reasons for denial in easy-to-understand language. The plan administrator must explain the information needed to perfect the claim, cite the plan provisions on which the denial was based, and detail the procedure for appealing the claim decision (Reference 1 below).\n   Ultimately, a participant may initiate a lawsuit to decide whether the plan should pay a claim. Depending on the amount of discretion accorded the administrator in interpreting a claim, the court could decide whether the denial of benefits constituted an abuse of discretion or review the facts de novo and make a decision on coverage (see KB-1 Topic 55).\n   For a detailed discussion of the benefit claims procedure, see KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nSupreme Court decisions\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that ERISA did not preempt an Illinois law allowing for an independent external review to resolve disputes over the \"medical necessity\" of medical treatments that a patient's primary care doctor has recommended (Reference 3 below). The end result of the Court's decision is that state independent review laws will control, as long as they don't create a new cause of action or provide a remedy beyond the benefits otherwise available under a plan.\n   The Supreme Court also has held that a Texas state law, the Texas Health Care Liability Act (fHCLA), was preempted by ERISA where two HMO participants sought recovery under the THCLA for their HMOs' refusal to provide certain treatment and services recommended by their doctors. The claims were only to rectify wrongful benefits denials; they did not arise independently of ERISA or the plans' terms. Because the claims were pure eligibility decisions, ERISA, not state law, provided the exclusive remedy (Reference 4 below).\n \nInterpretation of eligible expenses\n   In the process of paying or denying a claim, the administrator should differentiate expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from those that are not allowed under the plan. While many employers adopt many of the same plan provisions and follow state or federal laws that apply to the plans, each employer does have discretion in designing the welfare benefit plan that it offers to employees. Therefore, the claim payer must be able to identify each employer's plan and the specific provisions of the plan to identify eligible expenses.\n   Just because a charge is eligible for payment does not mean that the plan will reimburse for it. Charges that are not allowed should neither be reimbursed nor applied toward satisfaction of the deductible.\n   Pointer: The plan document should specify and define noncovered expenses so that the administrator, utilization reviewers, the employer, and participants can all clearly understand types of charges that the plan will not allow.\n   Payments that were wrongfully made by an administrator may be recovered under ERISA and claims fraudulently submitted may be denied payment.\n\nFor more information...\n   Claim procedure requirements under ERISA are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n   An ERISA-required review after a benefit denial is analyzed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n   Claim procedure requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are discussed at KB-1 Topic 934.\n\nFor more information ...\n   A discussion of possible reasons for denial of a medical claim is located at KB-1 Topic 10,425 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f) and (g).\n3 Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

(Reference 1 below)\n\nStandards of review\n\tIn reviewing a benefit denial under ERISA's civil enforcement standards, a court can consider the case anew from the beginning on its merits in what is called de novo review.\n\tHowever, where a plan gives the administrator or fiduciary the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan, a court needs only to determine whether the actions of the plan administrator were arbitrary and capricious.(Reference 2 below)\n\t\nSupreme Court rejection of deference exceptions. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that where a company's plan provisions gave the plan administrator the power to construe disputed terms, a federal district court should have deferred to the administrator's reasonable interpretation of disputed provisions.(Reference 3 below)\n\nArbitrary and capricious standard\nIn determining whether a fiduciary's actions were arbitrary and capricious, courts generally have considered whether\n\t1. the fiduciary acted rationally or reasonably;\n\t2. there was fraud or bad faith;\n\t3. there was a consistent application of the terms of the plan or ERISA; or\n\t4. the fiduciary's actions were based on substantial evidence.\n\nPointer: The provision of adequate notice prior to a fiduciary's exercise of discretionary authority might be considered relevant to a determination of arbitrariness.\nAn employee benefit plan that gave different reasons for denying benefits to a plan beneficiary at each stage of review failed to comply with requirements under ERISA.(Reference 4 below) The court found that the plan's denial had been arbitrary and capricious.\n\nReview of conflict-of-interest cases\n\tA plan administrator that both evaluates and pays benefits claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionai:y benefit determinations, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.(Refernce 5 below)\n\tThe conflict does not change the standard of review of a benefits denial from deferential to de novo, but the conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. \n\tA conflict of interest should prove more important where there is a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, such as where an insurance company administrator has a histoi:y of biased claims administration. \n\tThe conflict would prove less important, the court explained, where an administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\n\nFor more information ...\nThe standards of judicial review following a denial of benefits are discussed in greater detail at KB-1 Topic 130,090 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\nCivil enforcement under ERISA is discussed at KB-1 Topic 55.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1 Kinkead v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 45 - Basics of ERISA - Benefit Claims Procedures - Claims Procedures for Welfare Benefit Plans\n    Every welfare benefit plan must establish a claims procedure to process claims for benefits made by participants and beneficiaries. The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) has issued regulations that provide new standards for processing claims under group health and group disability plans.\n    In July, 2010, the IRS, EBSA, and the HHS issued interim final regulations that added a number of requirements for internal claims procedures and appeals. The new rules implement the claims appeals requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111-148). These ACA changes are effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, though the Labor Department has provided for a grace period. Claims procedures under health reform are discussed at r 934\n    A plan that denies a claim for plan benefits must give the claimant adequate written notice of the denial. The claimant must also receive a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of the denial (Reference 1 below).\n    The rules for filing a claim must be described in the summary plan description (SPD) (see r 110). A poorly written SPD that does not clearly specify a time limit for claims may excuse an employee from meeting the deadline (Reference 2 below).\n    The Eleventh Circuit has ruled that relevant medical records do not have to be supplied to a participant until after the decision to grant or deny a disability benefits claim has been made (Reference 3 below).\n\nNecessary information\n    A notice of a claim denial must state, in a manner reasonably calculated to be understood by the claimant, the following information:\n1. The specific reasons for the denial of the claim;\n2. A specific reference to the pertinent plan provision on which the denial is based;\n3. A description of any additional material or information that is necessary for a claimant to perfect the claim;\n4. An explanation of why the additional material or information needed to perfect the claim is necessary; and\n5. A description of the steps necessary (i.e., the appeals procedure) if the participant or beneficiary wishes to submit his or her claim for review.\n    Pointer: If a participant brings a lawsuit claiming that an administrator's decision to deny benefits was made in bad faith, the fact that an administrator can show that these procedures were adhered to could help the administrator avoid liability for punitive damages (Reference 4 below).\n\nAdministrator as fiduciary\n    When a plan administrator denies a participant's claim for benefits, the administrator is acting as a fiduciary and so must meet the rules governing the conduct of fiduciaries.\n\nDisability benefit claims\n    At the initial level, disability claims must be resolved within 45 days of receipt. A plan may extend the decision-making period for an additional 30 days for reasons beyond the control of the plan. If, after this first extension, the plan administrator determines that it will still be unable, again for reasons beyond the control of the plan, to make a decision, the plan may extend decision-making for a second 30-day period.\n    During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan. Reviews of disability claim denials must be completed within 45 days of receipt of the claimant's request for review by the plan. Plans providing disability benefits may extend the decision\u00admaking time on review for an additional 45-day period if the plan administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim (Reference 5 below).\n    Final disability claims regs EBSA has issued final regulations that would enhance existing disability benefit claims procedures under ERISA Sec.503 (Reference 6 below). Note, however, that the Labor Department delayed the applicability date of these regulations until April 1, 2018, for ERISA plans to comply with a final rule amending the claims procedure requirements applicable to disability benefits. In issuing these regulations, EBSA hopes to apply to disability benefits many of the claims procedural protections and safeguards that have been applied to group health plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). The purpose of the regulation would improve the current procedural protections for workers who become disabled and make claims for disability benefits from an employee benefit plan.\n    \nThe regulations make the following major changes to the internal claims procedures for disability plans:\n claims and appeals must be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making the benefit determination;\n benefit denial notices must contain a complete discussion of why the plan denied the claim and the standards applied in reaching the decision, including the basis for disagreeing with the views of health care professionals, vocational professionals, or with disability benefit determinations by the Social Security Administration (SSA);\n claimants must be given timely notice of their right to access to their entire claim file and other relevant documents and be guaranteed the right to present evidence and testimony in support of their claim during the review process;\n claimants must be given notice and a fair opportunity to respond before denials at the appeals stage are based on new or additional evidence or rationales;\n plans cannot prohibit a claimant from seeking court review of a claim denial based on a failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the plan if the plan failed to comply with the claims procedure requirements unless the violation was the result of a minor error;\n certain rescissions of coverage are to be treated as adverse benefit determinations triggering the plan's appeals procedures; and\n required notices and disclosures issued under the claims procedure regulation must be written in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.\n\n  Conflicts of interest. The final rule requires that decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or similar matters with respect to any individual must not be made based upon the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of disability benefits. For example, a plan cannot provide bonuses based on the number of denials made by a claims adjudicator. Similarly, a plan cannot contract with a medical expert based on the expert's reputation for outcomes in contested cases, rather than base on the expert's professional qualifications.\n  Right to appoint representative. The claims procedure of an ERISA-covered plan cannot \"preclude an authorized representative of a claimant from acting on behalf of such claimant in pursuing a benefit claim or appeal of an adverse benefit determination.\" In addition, prior department guidance on the claims procedure regulation confirms that authorized representatives are entitled to notifications in connection with initial claim determinations and appeals. Although a plan may establish reasonable procedures for determining whether an individual has been authorized to act on behalf of a claimant, the procedure cannot prevent claimants from choosing for themselves who will act as their representative or preclude them from designating an authorized representative for the initial claim, an appeal of an adverse benefit determination, or both. The plan must include any procedures for designating authorized representatives in the plan's claims procedures and in the plan's summary plan description (SPD) or a \nseparate document that accompanies the SPD. SPDs must satisfy the style and format requirements for SPDs in ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2520.102-2, and include a statement that the plan's claims procedures are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document (Reference 7 below).\n\n  Disclosure requirements. Under the final disability claims regulations, benefit denial notices must contain a more complete discussion of why the plan denied a claim and the standards used in making the decision. For example, the notices must include a discussion of the basis for disagreeing with a disability determination made by the SSA if presented by the claimant in support of his or her claim. Also, benefit denial notices must include a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request, the entire claim file and other relevant documents.\n Benefit denial notices also have to include the internal rules, guidelines, protocols, standards or other similar criteria of the plan that were used in denying a claim or a statement that none were used. Currently, instead of including these internal rules and protocols, benefit denial notices have the option of including a statement that such rules and protocols were used in denying the claim and that a copy will be provided to the claimant upon request.\n\n  Deemed exhaustion. If plans do not adhere to all disability claims processing rules, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, unless the violation was the result of a minor error and other specified conditions are met. If the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan, the claim or appeal is deemed denied on review without the exercise of discretion by a fiduciary and the claimant may immediately pursue his or her claim in court. The final rule also provides that the plan must treat a claim as re-filed on appeal upon the plan's receipt of a court's decision rejecting the claimant's request for review.\n  Coverage rescissions. Rescissions of coverage, including retroactive terminations due to alleged misrepresentation of fact (e.g. errors in the application for coverage) must be treated as adverse benefit determinations, thereby triggering the plan's appeals procedures. Rescissions for non-payment of premiums are not covered by this provision.\n  Culturally and linguistically appropriate manner. The disability claims final rule requires that benefit denial notices have to be provided in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner in certain situations. The final rule essentially adopts the ACA standard for group health benefit notices. Specifically, if a disability claimant's address is in a county where 10 percent or more of the population is literate only in the same non-English language, benefit denial notices must include a prominent statement in the relevant non-English language about the availability of language services. The plan would also be required to provide a verbal customer assistance process in the non-English language and provide written notices in the non-English language upon request.\n\nTiming of group health plan claims\n   Decisions on urgent health care claims must be made within 72 hours from the time the claim is made. There is also a 72-hour limit for decisions on appeals of denials of urgent care claims. For decisions on non-urgent claims, the regulations make a distinction between pre-service claims (group health claims that involve access to medical care) and post-service claims (claims that involve purely the payment or reimbursement of costs for medical care that has already been provided). The regulations require that pre-service claims be decided within a maximum of 15 days at the initial level, and 30 days on review of an adverse benefit determination. Decisions on post-service claims are subject to a maximum time period of 30 days for the initial decision and a maximum of 60 days on review of a denied claim (Reference 8 below).\n   During this period, however, the plan will be required to keep the claimant informed as to the issues that are delaying the decision and about any additional information the claimant should provide to the plan.\n   Notice requirements. The regulations create notice requirements in certain circumstances. In situations involving pre-service claims, plans will be required to provide a notice informing claimants that they failed to properly file a claim, if such is the case. However, this requirement will only be triggered by a communication from a claimant or a health care professional representing the claimant, and the notice may be provided orally unless requested in writing.\n   The regulations require that a plan inform a claimant of any protocol that was relied upon in denying a claim, and either supply the relevant protocol with the notice of denial or inform the claimant of its availability from the plan upon request and free of charge. Also, notifications of claim denials based on medical necessity, experimental treatment, or other similar exclusions or limits must either explain the scientific judgment of the plan or include a statement that such an explanation will be provided free of charge to the claimant upon request (Reference 9 below).\n   Appeal of claim denials. Claimants must be afforded 180 days in which to bring an appeal of a denied claim. The review must be conducted by a fiduciary who is neither the party who made the initial adverse determination nor a subordinate of that party (Reference 10 below). A plan administrator's affirmance of the denial of disability benefits in a first-level internal appeal is not an \"adverse benefit determi\u00ad nation\" and, as such, an ERISA plan is not required to provide a claimant with at least 180 days to file a mandatory second appeal (Reference 11 below).\n   The fiduciaries who review a claim denial that is based on a medical judgment must consult with a health care professional with appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine involved in the claim. The consultant must also be independent of any health care professional consulted in making the initial adverse benefit determination in that the reviewer must be different from, and not subordinate to, the individual involved in the initial determination. The reviewer need not be unaffiliated with the health plan in question.\n\nAppeals process under ACA\n   Under health reform legislation, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims (see KB-1 Topic 934).\n \nFor more information ...\n   Rules governing fiduciary responsibility are discussed beginning at r 25. Judicial review of a benefit denial is discussed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 ERISA Sec. 503(I).\n2 Dodson v. Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society, CA-8, (1997).\n3 Glazer v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 888 - Health Care Reform - Group Market Rules - Required Preventive Health Services Coverage\n\n    Group health plans and health insurance issuers providing group or individual health plans are required to provide coverage, without cost-sharing, for certain preventive services, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). This provision does not apply to grandfathered health plans (see KB-1 Topic 842).\n    Non-grandfathered group health plans and issuers must provide coverage (without any cost sharing) for certain preventive health services including, at minimum (Reference 1 below):\n1. evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of A or B in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (Reference 2 below);\n2. immunizations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n3. for infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA);\n4. with respect to women, any additional preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the HRSA USPSTF recommendations for mammography screening that were issued in 2009 which recommended routine screening only for women age 50 and older, will not be considered current. Instead, those issued in 2002, which recommended earlier screening starting at age 40, will be used (Reference 3 below).\n    For these services, plans presumably will rely on previous recommendations (Reference 4 below).\n    Use of aspirin. The USPSTF recommends the use of aspirin for certain men and women when the potential benefit due to a reduction in myocardial infarctions outweighs the potential harm. Aspirin is generally available over-the-counter (OTC). Aspirin and other OTC-recommended items and services must be covered without cost sharing only when prescribed by a health care provider (Reference 5 below).\n    Colonoscopy. Another USPSTF recommendation is a colonoscopy as a screening procedure. A plan or issuer may not impose cost sharing with respect to a required consultation prior to a colonoscopy screening procedure if the attending provider determines that the pre-procedure consultation would be medically appropriate for the individual, because the pre-procedure consultation is an integral part of the colonoscopy. In addition, the plan or issuer is required to cover any pathology exam on a polyp biopsy without cost sharing (Reference 6 below). A plan or issuer may not impose cost sharing with respect to a polyp removal during a colonoscopy performed as a screening procedure. On the other hand, a plan or issuer may impose cost sharing for a treatment that is not a recommended preventive service, even if the treatment results from a recommended preventive service (Reference 7 below).\n    BRCA testing. In addition, the USPSTF recommendation for genetic counseling and evaluation for routine breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) testing includes both genetic counseling and BRCA testing, if appropriate, for a woman as determined by her health care provider (Reference 8 below). The USPSTF recommends with a \"B\" rating to \"screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA 1 or BRCA 2). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing.\" As such, women found to be at increased risk using a screening tool designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk of having a potentially harmful gene mutation must receive coverage without cost sharing for genetic counseling, and, if indicated, testing for harmful BRCA mutations. This is true regardless of whether the woman has previously been diagnosed with cancer, as long as she is not currently symptomatic of or receiving active treatment for breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer (Reference 9 below).\n    Breast cancer medications. In September 2013, the USPTF recommended that physicians offer risk-reducing medications to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. In response to the USPTF recommendation, EBSA FAQs stipulate that, for plan or policy years beginning on or after September 24, 2014, both non-grandfathered group health plans and non-grandfathered health insurance coverage offered in the individual or group market must cover breast cancer risk-reducing medications such as tamoxifen or faloxifene without cost sharing subject to reasonable medical management. This requirement does not apply to grandfathered health plans (Reference 10 below).\n    Tobacco use. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. A group health plan or health insurance issuer will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement to cover tobacco use counseling and interventions, if, for example, the plan or issuer covers without cost-sharing (Reference 11 below):\n1. screening for tobacco use, and,\n2. for those who use tobacco products, at least two tobacco cessation attempts per year. For this purpose, covering a cessation attempt includes coverage for:\n\u25a1 four tobacco cessation counseling sessions of at least 10 minutes each (including telephone counseling, group counseling and individual counseling) without prior authorization, and\n\u25a1 all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tobacco cessation medications (including both prescription and over-the-counter medications) for a 90-day treatment regimen when prescribed by a health care provider without prior authorization.\n    Weight management. Non-grandfathered plans and issuers must cover, without cost sharing, screening for obesity in adults. In addition to such screening, the USPSTF currently recommends, for adult patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher, intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for weight management. The recommendation specifies that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions include, for example, the following:\n\u25a1 group and individual sessions of high intensity (12 to 26 sessions in a year),\n\u25a1 behavioral management activities, such as weight-loss goals,\n\u25a1 improving diet or nutrition and increasing physical activity,\n\u25a1 addressing barriers to change,\n\u25a1 self-monitoring, and\n\u25a1 strategizing how to maintain lifestyle changes (Reference 12 below).\n    Women's services. Pursuant to HRSA guidelines, new health plans must include the following preventive services for women without cost sharing (Reference 13 below):\n\u25a1 screening for gestational diabetes;\n\u25a1 human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as part of cervical cancer screening for women who are older than age 30;\n\u25a1 counseling on sexually transmitted infections;\n\u25a1 counseling and screening for HIV;\n\u25a1 contraceptive methods and counseling to prevent unintended pregnancies;\n\u25a1 lactation counseling and equipment to promote breastfeeding;\n\u25a1 screening and counseling to detect and prevent interpersonal and domestic violence; and\n\u25a1 yearly well-woman preventive care visits to obtain recommended preventive services.\n    Contraception coverage. Health care plans must cover, without cost sharing, the full range of FDA-approved methods for contraception. There are currently 18 distinct methods of contraception for women. While all 18 contraceptive methods must be made available without cost-sharing, health plans are allowed to use reasonable medical management techniques and impose cost-sharing to encourage the use of specific services or FDA-approved items within the chosen contraceptive method. For example, a plan may discourage use of brand name pharmacy items over generic pharmacy items through the imposition of cost sharing. In addition, if multiple services and FDA-approved items within a contraceptive method are medically appropriate for an individual, the plan may use reasonable medical management techniques to determine which specific products to cover without cost sharing. However, the plan must defer to an individual's attending provider and if the provider recommends a particular item, the plan must cover the recommended item without cost sharing (Reference 14 below).\n    Contraceptive methods that are generally available over the counter are only included if the method is both FDA-approved and prescribed for a woman by her health care provider. The HRSA Guidelines do not include contraception for men (Reference 15 below).\n    Exemptions from contraception coverage. Effective January 14, 2019, final regulations exempt objecting nongovernment employers from the general requirement to provide contraceptive coverage at no cost to participants in their group health plans.\n    The rules provide that any nongovernment employer that has religious or moral objections to providing coverage for some or all forms of birth control can simply not provide the coverage. These rules also apply to colleges and universities providing student health insurance coverage. Although there has been a limited accommodation for employers that have a religious objection, the exemption on the basis of a moral objection is entirely new.\n    Caution: In July 2019, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Pennsylvania and New Jersey are likely to succeed in proving that the agencies did not follow the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that the contraceptive exemption regulations are not authorized under the ACA or required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The court also concluded that the states will suffer a concrete and imminent financial injury from the increased use of state-funded services were the regulations to go into effect, and that an injunction would redress that injury. Therefore, it affirmed the district court's order preliminarily enjoining the rules' enforcement nationwide (Reference 16 below).\n    In October 2019, the Little Sisters of the Poor filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Third Circuit's decision. As we go to press, the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether it will hear the case.\n    The religious exemption is open to any nongovernment employer, including both nonprofit and for-profit employers. The same holds true for the moral exemption, except the religious exemption is available for publicly traded employers, but the moral objection is not. The government expects corporations to express their objections through the normal state law rules of corporate governance (Reference 17 below).\n    Objecting entities for purposes of religious exemption. The religious exemption applies to the extent that an entity objects, based on its sincerely held religious beliefs, to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) for coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, or a plan, issuer, or third party administrator that provides or arranges such coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services (Reference 18 below).\n    Guidelines issued under HHS Reg. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by the HRSA must not provide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments for contraceptive services with respect to a group health plan established or maintained by an objecting organization, or health insurance coverage offered or arranged by an objecting organization. Thus, the HRSA will exempt from any guidelines' requirements that relate to the provision of contraceptive services a group health plan (and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan) to the extent the non-governmental plan sponsor objects to such coverage. Such non\u00adgovernmental plan sponsors include, but are not limited to, the following entities (Reference 19 below):\n\u25a1 churches, integrated auxiliaries, and religious orders with religious objections;\n\u25a1 nonprofit organizations with religious or moral objections;\n\u25a1 for-profit entities that are not publicly traded, with religious or moral objections;\n\u25a1 for-profit entities that are publicly traded, with religious objections;\n\u25a1 other nongovernmental employers with religious objections;\n\u25a1 nongovernmental institutions of higher education with religious or moral objections;\n\u25a1 individuals with religious or moral objections, with employer sponsored or individual market coverage, where the plan sponsor and/or issuer (as applicable) are willing to offer them a plan omitting contraceptive coverage to which they object; and\n\u25a1 issuers with religious or moral objections, to the extent they provide coverage to a plan sponsor or individual that is also exempt.\n    The exemption is not available for government entities.\n    Objecting entities for purposes of moral exemption. The moral exemption applies to the extent that an entity objects to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, or for a plan, issuer, or third party administrator that provides or arranges such coverage or payments, based on its sincerely held moral convictions (Reference 20 below).\n    Guidelines issued under HHS Reg. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by the HRSA must not provide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments for contraceptive services with respect to a group health plan established or maintained by an objecting organization, or health insurance coverage offered or arranged by an objecting organization. Thus, the HRSA will exempt from any guidelines' requirements that relate to the provision of contraceptive services a group health plan (and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan) to the extent the non-governmental plan sponsor objects to such coverage. Such non\u00adgovernmental plan sponsors include, but are not limited to, the following entities (Reference 21 below):\n\u25a1 a nonprofit organization, or\n\u25a1 a for-profit entity that has no publicly traded ownership interests.\n    Institutions of higher education (with respect to their arrangement of student health coverage) that object to providing contraception coverage also qualify for the moral exemption.\n    Optional accommodation. The regulations provide a voluntary accommodation process as an option for eligible organizations (i.e., employers). An eligible organization is an organization that meets the following criteria (Reference 22 below):\n\u25a1 the  organization is an objecting entity described in HHS Reg. 147.132(a)(1)(i) or (ii); (see Objecting entities above),\n\u25a1 notwithstanding its exempt status, the organization voluntarily seeks to be considered an eligible organization to invoke the optional accommodation, and\n\u25a1 the organization self-certifies in the form and manner specified by the HHS Secretary or provides notice to the Secretary as required by the regulations.\n    To qualify as an eligible organization, the organization must make such self\u00adcertification or notice available for examination upon request by the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person authorized to make the certification or provide the notice on behalf of the organization, and must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements under ERISA Sec. 107. An eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process, and its issuer must provide participants and beneficiaries written notice of such revocation as specified in HHS guidance.\n    Accommodation process. A group health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization that provides benefits through one or more group health insurance issuers (or on a self-insured basis) may voluntarily elect an optional accommodation under which its health insurance issuer(s) (or third party administrator) will provide payments for all or a subset of contraceptive services for one or more plan years. To invoke the optional accommodation process (Reference 23 below):\n\u25a1 the eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more health insurance issuers (or third party administrators) and\n\u25a1 the eligible organization must provide either a copy of the self-certification to each issuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to the HHS Secretary it is an eligible organization and of its objection to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services.\n    The self-certification (EBSA Form 700) is accessible at https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/laws-and-regulations/laws/affordable-care-act/for-employers-and-advisers/ebsa-form-700-revised.pdf.\n    When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole responsibility for providing such coverage.\n    When a notice is provided to the HHS Secretary, the notice must include:\n\u25a1 the name of the eligible organization,\n\u25a1 a statement that it objects to coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an identification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization objects, if applicable) but that it would like to elect the optional accommodation process,\n\u25a1 the plan name and type (that is, whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of HHS Reg. \u00a7147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of ERISA Sec.3(33), and\n\u25a1 the name and contact information for any of the plan's health insurance issuers (or third party administrators).\n    Insured group health plans. If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or the notification from HHS and does not have an objection to providing the contraceptive services identified in the self-certification or the notification from HHS, then the issuer will provide payments for contraceptive services as follows (Reference 24 below):\n\u25a1 The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan and provide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered for plan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan.\n\u25a1 With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\n    The issuer must segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organ\u00ad ization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.\n    Self-insured group health plans. If a third party administrator receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or a notification and is willing to enter into or remain in a contractual relationship with the eligible organization or its plan to provide administrative services for the plan, then the third party administrator will provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services, using one of the following methods (Reference 25 below):\n\u25a1 Provide payments for the contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries without imposing any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries; or\n\u25a1 Arrange for an issuer or other entity to provide payments for contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries without imposing any cost\u00ad sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\n    If a third party administrator provides or arranges payments for contraceptive services, the costs of providing or arranging such payments may be reimbursed through an adjustment to the Federally facilitated Exchange user fee for a participating issuer (Reference 26 below).\n    Notice of availability of separate payments for services. For each plan year to which the optional accommodation is to apply, an issuer (and a third party administrator) must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the availability of separate payments for contraceptive services contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but separate from, any application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or reenrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first day of each applicable plan year (Reference 27 below). The notice must specify that the eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides or arranges separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact information for questions and complaints. The following model language, or substantially similar language, may be used to satisfy the notice requirement: Your employer has certified that your group health plan qualifies for an accommodation with respect to the Federal requirement to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive services for women, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing. This means that your employer will not contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. Instead, [name of third party administrator/health insurance issuer] will provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services that you use, without cost sharing and at no other cost, for so long as you are enrolled in your group health plan. Your employer will not administer or fund these payments. If you have any questions about this notice, contact [contact information for third party administrator/health insurance issuer].\n    Lactation support. In addition to contraception coverage, the HRSA Guide\u00ad lines specifically incorporate comprehensive prenatal and postnatal lactation support, counseling, and equipment rental. Accordingly, the items and services described in the HRSA Guidelines are required to be covered in accordance with the requirements of the interim final regulations (that is, without cost sharing, subject to reasonable medical management, which may include purchase instead of rental of equipment). Coverage of comprehensive lactation support and counseling and costs of renting or purchasing breastfeeding equipment extends for the duration of breastfeeding (Reference 28 below). Plans and issuers are not permitted to require individuals to obtain breastfeeding equipment within a specified time period (for example, within 6 months of delivery) in order for the breastfeeding equipment to be covered without cost sharing (Reference 29 below).\n    Plans and issuers are required to provide a list of the lactation counseling providers within the network. Although the preventive services requirements do not include specific disclosure requirements, provisions of other applicable laws require disclosure of lactation counseling providers available under the plan or coverage. Group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage must provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) that includes an Internet address (or other contact information) for obtaining a list of the network providers.\n    In addition, group health plans subject to ERISA must provide a Summary Plan Description (SPD) that describes provisions governing the use of network providers, the composition bf the provider network, and whether, and under what circumstances, coverage is provided for out-of-network services. For those plans with provider networks, the listing of providers can be furnished in a separate document accompanying the SPD, as long as the SPD describes the provider network and states that provider lists are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document.\n    Also, issuers of qualified health plans (QHP) in the Exchanges and the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) must make their provider directories available online (Reference 30 below).\n    Cost sharing for lactation counseling services. Group health plans cannot impose cost sharing with respect to lactation counseling services obtained outside the network. If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide lactation counseling services, the plan or issuer must cover the item or service when performed by an out-of-network provider without cost sharing (Reference 31 below).\n    In the case where a state does not license lactation counseling providers, subject to reasonable medical management techniques, lactation counseling must be covered without cost sharing by the plan or issuer when it is performed by any provider acting within the scope of his or her license or certification under applicable state law. Lactation counseling could be provided by another provider type acting within the scope of his or her license or certification (for example, a registered nurse), and the plan or issuer would be required to provide coverage for the services without cost sharing (Reference 32 below).\n    Plans or issuers cannot impose cost sharing with respect to lactation counseling received on an outpatient basis. If a recommendation or guideline does not specify the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of a recommended preventive service, then the plan or issuer may use reasonable medical management techniques to determine any such coverage limitations. However, it is not a reasonable medical management technique to limit coverage for lactation counseling to services provided on an in-patient basis (Reference 33 below).\n    Services beyond minimums. Health plans or issuers are not barred from providing coverage for preventive care services beyond those recommended by the USPSTF. Similarly; health plans or issuers are not prohibited from denying coverage for preventive services that are not recommended by the Task Force (Reference 34 below).\n    Out-of-network providers. If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide a particular preventive service, the plan or issuer must cover the item or service when performed by an out-of-network provider and not impose cost sharing with respect to the item or service (Reference 35 below).\n    Scope, setting or frequency. If a recommendation or guideline for a recommended preventive health service does not specify the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of that service, the plan or issuer can use reasonable medical management techniques (which generally limit or exclude benefits based on medical necessity or medical appropriateness using prior authorization requirements, concurrent review, or similar practices) to determine any coverage limitations under the plan. Thus, to the extent not specified in a recommendation or guideline, a plan or issuer may rely on the relevant evidence base and these established techniques to determine the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of a recommended preventive health service (Reference 36 below).\n    Example: A group health plan does not impose a copayment for colorectal cancer preventive services when performed in an in-network ambulatory surgery center. In contrast, the same preventive service provided at an in-network outpatient hospital setting would generally require a $250 copayment.\n    This plan design is permissible. PHSA \u00a7 2713 and its implementing regulations allow plans to use reasonable medical management techniques to control costs. Plans may use reasonable medical management techniques to steer patients towards a particular high-value setting such as an ambulatory care setting for providing preventive care services, provided the plan accommodates any individuals for whom it would be medically inappropriate to have the preventive service provided in the ambulatory setting (as determined by the attending provider) by having a mechanism for waiving the otherwise applicable copayment for the preventive services provided in a hospital (Reference 37 below).\n    Cost-sharing requirements. If a recommended preventive service (RPS) is billed separately from an office visit, then cost-sharing requirements for the office visit may be imposed. If an RPS is not billed separately and the primary purpose of the visit is the delivery of a preventive item or service, then cost-sharing requirements may not be imposed. If an RPS is not billed separately but the primary purpose of the office visit is not the delivery of a preventive item or service, then cost-sharing requirements may be imposed. Also, a plan or issuer is not required to provide coverage for RPS delivered by an out-of-network provider, and may impose cost-sharing requirements on recommended preventive services delivered by an out-of-network provider (Reference 38 below).\n    If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide a particular preventive service, the plan or issuer must cover the item or service when performed by an out-of-network provider and not impose cost sharing with respect to the item or service (Reference 39 below).\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2713(a) (1).\n2 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2713(a)(1).\n3 ERISAReg. \u00a7 2590.715-2713(c).\n4 www.ahrq.gov/clinic.\n5 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII), Q4, February 20, 2013.\n6 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXIX), Q7 & Q8, October 23, 2015.\n7 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII), Q5, February 20, 2013.\n8 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII), Q6, February 20, 2013.\n9 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXIX), Ql0, October 23, 2015.\n10 FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XVIII) and Mental Health Parity Implementation, January 9, 2014.\n11 FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation (Part XIX), Q5, May 2, 2014.\n12 FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXIX), Q6, October 23, 2015.\n13 www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/\n14 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXVI), May 11, 2015.\n15 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII, Q14 & 15), February 20, 2013.\n16 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 4 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Health Plan Evolution - Appendix 4.2 Vision Care and Hearing Care Plans\n\nVISION CARE AND HEARING CARE PLANS\n\nVISION CARE\n\n\tMost of us would rank vision as a very important, if not the most important, of our senses. Yet vision care is often neglected. Eye disease, treatment, and surgery are traditionally covered under hospital, surgical, major medical, and comprehensive medical policies. However, most of these plans exclude routine vision examination and eyewear from coverage. Separate (freestanding) vision plans cover services such as routine examinations and materials (products) such as lenses, frames, and contact lenses. In a purist sense, some do not consider this coverage insurance, because of the absence of illness or disease. Nevertheless, the need for appropriate vision care is real, as about 60 percent of the adult population in North America wears corrective eyewear. A routine vision examination not only confirms whether prescription eyewear is necessary but may detect unrelated problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Aside from the obvious medical benefits to employees, vision care plans have the potential of reducing accidents and increasing productivity-factors that are of major importance to the employer. Vision care is often compared to dental care because of its frequently elective and predictable nature. However, despite general reductions in employee benefit programs, some though not many employers are adding or continuing to provide vision care benefits.\n\nProviders\n\n\tThere are three types of vision care professionals:\n\n\t1. Ophthalmologists are medical doctors (MDs) specializing in the total care of the eye, including diagnosis, treatment of eye diseases, and surgery. Many perform eye examinations and prescribe corrective lenses. Some also dispense corrective eyewear. An ophthalmologist typically completes four years of premedical training, another four years of medical school, and subsequent internship and residency.\n\n\t2. Optometrists are doctors of optometry (ODs) and are licensed to examine, diagnose, treat, and manage diseases and disorders of the visual system, the eye, and associated structures as well as diagnose related systemic conditions. They are trained to detect eye disease and/or symptoms requiring the attention of ophthalmologists. In addition to performing vision examinations and prescribing lenses, most optometrists dispense glasses and contact lenses. An optometrist typically completes undergraduate work and is graduated from a college of optometry.\n\n\t3. Opticians fit, adjust, and dispense eyewear (lenses, frames, and contact lenses) prescribed by ophthalmologists and optometrists. They are eyewear retailers and provide advice on which lenses and frames are most appropriate. Many grind and fabricate eyewear, verify the finished products, and repair and replace various ophthalmic devices. Optician certification, licensure, and registration vary by state, as do training and apprenticeship.\n\nCovered Benefits\n\n\tCovered benefits include vision examination, lenses, and frames.\n\nVision Examination\n\n\tA thorough examination includes a history of general health, vision complaints, and an external and internal eye examination. Other services may include various ocular tests, usually including, but not limited to, coordination of eye movements, tonometry, depth perception (for children), and refraction testing for distance and near vision. In addition to the possible need for corrective eyewear, the examination could detect cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, and brain tumors. Some plans allow an examination at 12- or 24-month intervals, and it is up to the employee to arrange for eyewear if needed. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) often feature \"exam-only\" plans.\n\nLenses\n\tThe lens is the heart of sight-corrective material. Single-vision lenses are the most widely used, with multivision lenses (bifocal or trifocal) also being dispensed in large quantities. Plastic has replaced glass as the predominant lens material, and a wide array of lenses, such as oversized, photochromic, and tinted, are available. Most plans consider these \"cosmetic extras\" and outside normal plan limits. Many plans do provide benefits for contact lenses even though they are likely to be worn for cosmetic rather than for medical reasons.\n\n\tMany dispensers have an in-house laboratory for grinding and fab\u00ad rication of the more routinely prescribed eyewear, while others use full service laboratories.\n\nFrames\n\n\tThe cosmetic element is much more obvious in the area of frames than in lenses. Frames are increasingly being selected for cosmetic purposes and at times are part of a fashion wardrobe. The cost can run into hundreds of dollars for plastic or metal frames of almost limitless sizes, shapes, and colors. Herein lies a dilemma for the payor. The frame is a must, but how does one avoid paying for fashion while giving a fair reimbursement for utility? Certain plans make allowances up to a specified dollar figure, while others approve a limited selection; for example, $100 frames each for men, women, and children.\n\nPlan Design\n\n\tPlan design include frequency limits, schedule-of-benefits approach, and preferred provider networks.\n\nFrequency Limits\n\n\tTo control unnecessary use and keep administrative costs down, plans use a time limit (frequency) with which a participant may utilize a benefit plan for covered expenses. Examples of frequencies allowed by four plans are noted in Table A4.2-l.\n\nSchedule-of-Benefits Approach\n\n\tThis type of plan has maximum allowances for each service and material and a limit on the frequency of use. Examples are shown in Table A4.2-2. A typical schedule pays the lesser of the claimed or schedule maximum.\n\n\nT A B L E\tA4.2\u00b71\n\nExamples of Frequencies with Which Participants May Access Benefits\n\n\t\t\tMonth Intervals\n\t\tPlan 1\tPlan 2\tPlan 3\tPlan 4\nExaminations\t24\t12\t12\t12\nLenses\t\t24\t24\t12\t12\nFrames\t\t24\t24\t24\t12\n\n\n\tSchedules can be national or regional, based on a geographic per\u00ad centage of usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) charges.\n\n\tAdvantages of a schedule-of-benefits plan are that it is easy to understand, it has no restriction on the choice of provider, and it encourages the thrifty employee to shop around. The employer is cognizant of premium outlay, as the schedule ceiling does not change with inflation, and administration is simplified for the insurer or administrator because the frequencies and caps are determined in advance.\n\nT A B L E\tA4.2\u00b72\n\nExamples of Maximum Allowances for Vision Care Plans\n\nService/Material\tMaximum Allowed($)\nExamination\t\t\t50\nLenses (pair)\nSingle-vision\t\t\t60\nBifocal\t\t\t\t90\nTrifocal\t\t\t110\nLenticular\t\t\t140\nContacts (elective)\t\t100\nFrames\t\t\t\t60\n \n\nPreferred Provider Networks\n\n\tPreferred provider plans steer employees to a network of participating providers that have agreed to provide certain services for a negotiated fee. Employees who use a provider in the network may have many of the plan benefits covered 100 percent or pay only a minimum copayment, usually from $5 to $20. There is no claim form for the employee. An employee simply shows an identification card, which can be subject to confirmation at the provider's place of business, or the employee can mail a request for vision services and materials to the administrator and receive a benefit form stating which benefits are available and for what length of time, and the extent of the copayment.\n\n\tProviders are solicited by the insurer or administrator with the expectation of increased patient volume. In return, the provider agrees to reimbursement of discounted material costs plus dispensing fees. Some plans also mandate the use of specific laboratories. Various quality control measures are inserted into these plans, and peer review is common. In some plans, participating providers can charge the regular retail price for over\u00adsized or tinted lenses and for designer frames, while others call for reduced charges for these extras.\n\n\tMost plans allow reimbursement even when a participating provider is not utilized. In these instances, the employee must pay the provider's charge and file a claim. Reimbursement is based on a schedule or UCR determination. When a non-network provider is used, the employee's out\u00adof-pocket expense is almost always greater than it would be with a participating provider. Figure A4.2-3 illustrates a sample plan.\n\n\tThese plans usually follow a medical plan pattern, with a percentile of the charges in a given area prevailing. A higher figure is allowed for examination and lenses, and less for lenses of a cosmetic nature. Inflation is shared with the employee, with a percentage of coinsurance applied with the medical reimbursement. A separate means of administration is unnecessary.\n\nVision Benefits in Flexible Benefit Plans\n\n\tFlex plans increasingly include ancillary benefits, including vision care. They enable an employee to choose among various coverages, taking into account factors such as overall health, spouse coverage, and specific family needs. Although the design of these plans varies, employers sometimes allocate a certain number of \"flex credits\" to each employee, who then uses these to \"purchase\" benefits. Each employee chooses the benefits that best\n\n\nF I G U R E\tA4.2\u00b73\n\nPreferred Provider Network Sample Plan\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn-Network\t\tOut-of-Network (Program Allowance)\nExam (every 12 months)\t\t\t100%\t\t\t$32\n\nFrames (every 12 months)\t\t100%\t\t\t$24\n\n\t\t\t\t\t(up to $60 retail value)\n\nLenses (every 12 months)\t\t100%\t\t\t$24 single vision\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$36 bifocal\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$46 trifocal\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$72 aphakic/lenticular\n\nContact lenses (every 12 months in lieu of glasses)\n\nPrescription and fitting\t\t100%\t\t\t$20 daily wear\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$30 extended wear\n\nStandard\t\t\t\t100%\t\t\t$48\n\nSpecialty\t\t\t\t100%\t\t\t$48 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(up to $75 retail value)\n\nVision Care Options*\t\t\t10% discount\t\tNot covered\n\n(such as tints, contact lens solution)\n\n\u2022These allowances and discounts are only available at the point of purchase.\n\nfit his or her needs. Once the employer allocation has been used, the employee may purchase additional benefits at his or her own cost. They place vision care in competition with other coverages.\n\nFlexible Spending Accounts\n\n\tIf not covered under a medical plan or a freestanding plan, eligible vision care expenses often are covered by some type of spending account. Under a flexible spending account (FSA) arrangement, the employee may reduce income and Social Security taxes by funding benefits such as vision care with pretax dollars. At the beginning of the plan year, employees can designate a certain amount of money (up to a maximum) to be deducted from salary, thereby reducing the base upon which taxes are paid. The employer holds the money and \"reimburses\" the employee upon verification of covered expenses. (See Chapter 25 for a complete discussion of flex plans and FSAs.) Alternatively, vision care expenses are eligible for reimburse\u00ad ment under a health savings account (HSA) or a health reimbursement account (HRA) if an employee participates in such plans.\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n\tOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to provide protective eyewear to employees in positions exposing them to the danger of eye injury. These \"safety glass\" programs are usually outside the normal health benefit package.\n\nHEARING CARE\n\n\tA majority of benefit packages do not contain this coverage. The aging population, coupled with a noisy contemporary society, contributes to hearing loss and impairment, and it is estimated that more than 10 percent of the population is affected. Despite the generally acknowledged increase in the number of hearing-impaired persons and the substantially improved technology of hearing-aid instruments available, many would rather con\u00ad tinue with this impairment than bear the stigma of wearing a hearing aid in public.\n\nCoverage\n\n\tSurgical procedures affecting the ear are normally covered in standard medical policies. Beyond this, some HMOs and major medical and comprehensive policies include hearing aids. However, more complete coverage is afforded by plans designed specifically to cover hearing care.\n\nHearing Care Benefits\n\n\tA common benefit package includes an 80 percent reimbursement of services and materials up to a ceiling of $300 to $600. The frequency of benefit availability is usually every 36 months. The following items are often covered:\n\n\t\u25a0 Otologic examination (by a physician or surgeon)\n\t\u25a0 Audiometric examination (by an audiologist)\n\t\u25a0 Hearing instrument (including evaluation, ear mold fitting, and follow-up visits)\n\n\tPreferred provider plans in which access to a panel would result in discounts for audiologist fees as well as hearing-aid instruments are also available. Several administrators have developed service plans in which copayments apply when participating providers are utilized. Material costs can be reimbursed on a cost-plus dispensing-fee basis. However, identical procedures vary in different geographic areas and even within specific metropolitan areas.\n\n\tAs with vision care expenses, an FSA is a convenient vehicle through which to budget for hearing care expenses in the absence of employee benefit coverage.\n\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 11 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Differences Between Medicine and Dentistry Drive Plan Design\n               Medicine and dentistry have many differences, and sound dental plan design recognizes these. These differences include practice location, the nature of care, cost, and emphasis on prevention.\n\nLocation\n              The typical physician practices in a group, while many dentists practice almost exclusively in individual offices. Partly because of these practice differences, physicians tend to associate with other physicians with greater frequency than dentists associate with other dentists. This isolation, along with the inherent differences in the nature of medical and dental care, tends to produce a greater variety of dental practice patterns than is the case in medicine. In addition, practicing in isolation does not afford the same opportunities for peer review and general quality control.\n\nNature of Care, Cost, and Prevention\n             Perhaps contributing more significantly to the differences in medicine and dentistry are the important differences between the nature of medical and dental care.\n\n             First and perhaps foremost, because of the importance of preventive dentistry, the need for dental care is almost universal to ensure sound oral hygiene. Many individuals sometimes require only preventive or no medical care for years. Individuals routinely visit their dentists for preventive dental care, but in medicine the patient typically visits a physician with certain symptoms-often pain or discomfort-and seeks relief.\n\n             Dental treatment, because of its emphasis on prevention, is often considered elective. Unless there is pain or trauma, dental care is sometimes postponed. The patient recognizes that life is not at risk and as a result has few reservations about postponing treatment. In fact, postponement may be preferable to some patients-perhaps because of an aversion to visiting the dentist, rooted many years in the past when dental technology was less developed.\n\n             Because major dental care is not life-threatening and time-critical, dentists' charges for major courses of treatment are often discussed in advance of the treatment when there is no pain or trauma. As with any number of other consumer decisions, the patient may opt to defer the treatment to a later time or spend the money elsewhere.\n\n             A second difference in the nature of care is that, while medical care is rarely cosmetic, dental care often is. A crown, for example, may be necessary to save a tooth, but it also may be used to improve the patient's appearance. Many people place orthodontics into the same category, although evidence exists that failure to obtain needed orthodontic care may result in problems ranging from major gum disease to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders in later life.\n\n             A third major difference between the nature of medical and dental care is that dentistry often offers alternative procedures for treating disease and restoring teeth, many of which are equally effective. For example, a molar cavity might be treated by a composite or resin filling, which may cost twice as much as a simple amalgam filling. In these instances, the choice of the appropriate procedure is influenced by a number of factors, including the cost of the alternatives, the condition of the affected tooth and the teeth surrounding it, and the likelihood that a particular approach will be successful.\n\n             There are other significant differences in medical care and dentistry that will have an effect on plan design. These include the cost of the typical treatment and the emphasis on prevention.\n\n             Dental expenses generally are lower, more predictable, and budgetable. The average dental claim check is only about $155. Medical claims, on average, are much higher.\n\n             The last significant difference is the emphasis on prevention. The advantages of preventive dentistry are clearly documented. While certain medical diseases and injuries are self-healing, dental disease, once started, almost always gets progressively worse. Therefore, preventive care may be more productive in dentistry than in medicine. Certainly, the value of preventive dentistry relative to its cost is acknowledged.\n\n"

With a true group plan, the employer is the policy\u00adholder and employees are issued certificates of insurance. The employer can choose to include retirees, spouses, adult children, parents/in-laws, and siblings as part of the eligible group. With a multilife approach, individual insureds are the policyholders and are issued individual policies. In most cases, true group is a better match for larger employers, particularly those with widely dispersed populations. True group plans offer the following advantages:\n\u25a0 Availability of guaranteed issue for eligible, actively-at work employees\n\u25a0 No minimum participation requirements\n\u25a0 Fully portable coverage\n\u25a0 Low group rates, in many cases, with a rate guarantee period\n\u25a0 Transfer of reserve capabilities\n\u25a0 Turnkey approach to enrollment and administration\n\u25a0 Employer-dedicated website to support enrollment\n\tA multilife approach may be attractive to smaller employers or those wishing to give their employees greater flexibility in customizing their coverage.

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 3 - The Environment of Employee Benefit Plans - Risk Concepts and Employee Benefit Planning - Insurance and Insurable Risk\n\nINSURANCE AND INSURABLE RISK\n\tInsurance is one of the most popular methods of funding employee benefit plans, but, as explained in later chapters of this Handbook, many other options exist. The advantages and disadvantages of using insurance in the design of a benefit plan are discussed in the next section.\n\nAdvantages of Insurance\n\tA number of reasons account for why insurance can be used effectively in an employee benefit plan. One advantage is that there may be a known premium (cost) that is set in advance by the insurance company. The employer may have better control over its budget with a known premium, because any high shock losses would be the problem of the insurance company and not the insured. Having an outside administrator also can be an advantage to the employer. The employer does not have to get involved in disputes involving employees over coverage of the plan, because these would be handled by the insurance company. Employers may prefer insurance to some other form of funding in order to obtain the financial backing of an outside financial institution. This, of course, depends upon the financial strength of the insurance company selected, and care should go into this choice. Insurance companies are often lead\u0002ers in the area of loss control and may help in the design and implementation of systems designed to control costs for the employer. A final advantage is that it may be more economical for an employer to use insurance rather than other alternatives. The insurance company may be more efficient and able to do the job at a lower total cost.\n\nDisadvantages of Insurance\n\tInsurance is not always the preferred method of funding employee benefit plans. A number of costs are involved that must be considered. Insurance companies charge administrative expenses that are added to the premium (or loaded) to compensate for their overhead expenses. Home office costs, licensing costs, commissions, taxes, loss-adjustment expenses, and the like all must go into the loading. One must realize that the premium covers not only direct losses but also the insurance company\u2019s overhead. The amount may vary from a small percent ofthe premium (e.g., 2 percent to 5 percent) to potentially a very high amount (25 percent or more) depending on the type of contract involved. Another potential disadvantage is that employer satisfaction is directly affected by the insurer\u2019s ability to handle claims and solve problems. Slow payment or restrictive claim practices can have an adverse effect on employees.\n\tWhether something is an advantage or disadvantage often depends upon the specific insurance company involved. It is important to use care in the selection of an insurer. Discussing the merits of the insurer with other clients and carefully analyzing the carrier\u2019s financial stability are critical elements in the selection process.\n\nCharacteristics of an Insurable Risk\n\tIt often is said that anything can be insured if one is willing to pay the premium required. Insurance companies, however, normally will insure a risk only if it meets certain minimum standards. These standards or prerequisites are needed for an insurer to manage the insurance company in a sound financial manner. Without suitable risks, an insurance company can find itself in serious financial trouble. An insurance company is subject to the same problems as any other business\u2014inadequate capitalization, a weak investment portfolio, or poor management. Insurance companies have the additional problem of insuring risks that could result in catastrophic losses.\n\tThe following is a list of the characteristics of a risk that are desired in order for it to be considered an \u201cinsurable risk\u201d:\n\n\t1. There should be a large number of homogeneous risks (exposure units).\n\t2. The loss should be verifiable and measurable.\n\t3. The loss should not be catastrophic in nature.\n\t4. The chance of loss should be subject to calculation.\n\t5. The premium should be reasonable or economically feasible.\n\t6. The loss should be accidental from the standpoint of the insured.\n\n\tIt should be noted that this list is what is considered ideal from the standpoint of the insurance company. Most risks are not perfect in all aspects, and insurance companies have to weigh all aspects of a risk to determine if, overall, it meets the criteria of an insurable risk.\n\nLarge Number of Homogeneous Risks\n\tThe insurance company must be able to calculate the number of losses it will incur from the total number of risks it insures. Assume that a life insurance company has just been formed and it is to insure its first two people. Each wants $100,000 of life insurance. In order to calculate a premium, the company needs to know the chance of dying for each of the two people. Without this information, the company will have no idea of whether these people will live or die during the policy period. Should both die during this period, $200,000 would be needed for the claims. If neither dies, the company would need nothing for the claims. The conclusion one reaches is that the premium should be somewhere between $0 and $200,000. This information is not very helpful, and the insurance company could not insure the risk based on it. What is needed is a large number of similar risks so that statistics can be developed to determine an accurate probability of loss for each risk being evaluated. Insurance is based on the law of large numbers, which means that the greater the number of exposures, the more closely will the actual results approach the probable results that are expected from an infinite number of exposures. For example, life insurance companies have accumulated information based on the large number of lives that have been insured over the years that enables them to develop mortality tables reflecting the expected mortality for a given type of risk. Life, medical, dental, and disability risks all require large numbers of cases to determine proper premium rates.\n\n\tEmployee benefit plans may or may not have the numbers needed to accurately determine loss expectations. This would depend upon the specific plan. Those plans with large numbers of homogeneous risks can be experience rated. This means the premiums will be calculated with the data from the plan experience itself. Smaller plans would not have an adequate number of risks, and other alternatives would be needed. For example, small plans can be combined with other small plans to get creditable statistics, or insurance companies might ignore small-plan statistics and rely on loss statistics developed independently of the plan.\n\nLoss Should Be Verifiable and Measurable\n\tIt is important that an insurance company be able to verify a loss so as to determine the actual financial loss involved. Certain risks pose no problem in determining if a loss has taken place. Examples would be fire and windstorm losses with a home or a collision loss with one\u2019s automobile. Furthermore, the financial value of these losses can be determined accurately by the use of appraisals and other forms of valuation. Other types of risks are harder to evaluate. An example is a claim for theft of money from a home. Did the theft take place? Did the person have any money at home to be stolen? With risks that are difficult to evaluate, the insurance company has to take other precautions to protect itself from false and inflated claims.\n\tEmployee benefits are subject to the same types of problems. Death claims and retirement benefit claims generally are the easiest in which to determine whether a loss has taken place or not. Once a death claim has been verified, the amount of loss is normally the face value of the insurance contract. Few problems result from death claims. The same is true of retirement benefits. Assuming the age of the retiree can be verified, the benefit promised by the plan will be paid. At the other extreme are disability income claims. In some situations, an insurer might be uncertain as to whether a valid claim exists or not. Some disability losses, such as back injuries, are very difficult to determine. Is the insured actually disabled or not? Still other employee benefit losses may fall between these two extremes. Medical and dental losses can fall into this category. Several methods are available to prevent cases where employee benefit loss is difficult to verify or measure. Policy provisions, benefit maximums, waiting periods, alternate medical verification, required second opinion on certain surgical procedures, and hospital-stay monitoring are a few of the provisions that help limit these situations.\n\nLoss Should Not Be Catastrophic in Nature\n\tA serious problem occurs when a large percentage of the risks insured can be lost from the same event. Assume a fire insurance company insured all of its risks in one geographic location. A serious fire could result in catastrophic losses to the company. This did happen in the early history of fire insurance. Fires in London, Chicago, Baltimore, and San Francisco resulted in insurance company bankruptcies and loss of confidence in the industry. It became obvious that a geographic spread of the risks insured was essential, because a concentration of losses from one event could seriously impair or even bankrupt a company. Cases exist in which it is almost impossible to obtain a spread ofthe risks. In such cases, insurance becomes difficult or impossible to obtain. Flood and unemployment losses are examples. Unemployment can cover wide geographic areas, and a geographic spread would not help prevent a catastrophic loss. The same could be true for flood losses. The federal or state government might insure this type of risk, but it would be necessary for it to subsidize the premium rates to make them affordable.\n\tEmployee benefits are seldom subject to problems relating to inability to get a geographic spread of the risk. Benefit plans often insure life risks, hospital and dental risks, and disability income losses. For the most part, these types of risks are not subject to catastrophic loss due to geographic location, but examples can be imagined in which catastrophic losses might exist. The possibility of a plant explosion or a poison gas leak causing a large number of deaths or medical losses, or a concentration of certain diseases because of the exposure to certain elements that are indigenous to a specific employee group theoretically exist. Usually, however, this is not an important consideration in underwriting typical benefit plans. Policy limitations, reinsurance, and restrictions on groups insured can all be used to minimize the problem to the extent it exists.\n\nChance of Loss Should Be Subject to Calculation\n\tFor an insurance company to be able to calculate a premium that is reasonable to the insured and that represents the losses of a particular risk, certain information is essential. Data on both the frequency of losses and the severity of the losses must be available to determine the loss portion of the premium. This often is referred to as the pure premium portion of the premium. Essential to the pure premium calculation would be a large number of homogeneous exposure units, as already discussed. If an employer is large enough, the plan losses alone could be used to determine the pure premium portion. The meaning of \u201clarge\u201d depends upon the type of risk involved. At least several hundred employees would probably be needed for full reliance upon the data.\n\nPremium Should Be Reasonable or Economically Feasible\n\tFor an employee benefit plan to be acceptable to an employer and to employees, the plan must have a premium that is considered reasonable relative to the risk being insured; that is, the insured must be able to pay the premium. An insurance company\u2019s expenses not related to the losses covered by the pure premium must be added to that premium to obtain the total premium. The expense portion may be referred to as the loading associated with the risk. The \u201cpure premium\u201d plus the \u201cloading\u201d would make up the total premium to be paid by the plan. Employees who pay a part or all of the premium (participating plan) will not participate if they can obtain a lower premium in an individual insurance plan or if they can be insured through a spouse\u2019s plan at a lower cost, and the employer will be unable or unwilling to pay the premium if the rate is not reasonable.\n\tWhy would a premium be noncompetitive? This could happen for any number of reasons. For example, a plan could be populated by a high number of older employees. The resulting rate may mean that the younger employees can find lower-cost insurance outside of the plan. The younger employees are unwilling to subsidize the rates for the older employees. Also, the employer may not want to pay the needed premiums. Other reasons for noncompetitive plans could be poor loss experience from a high number of sick and disabled in a plan, or a plan having specific benefits that have resulted in high loss payout. For example, a plan may provide unlimited benefits for drug- or alcohol-related sickness, and the plan member makeup may have resulted in heavy payout for these problems. The bottom line is that the resulting loss experience has made the plan noncompetitive. It is not unusual for an employee group initially to pay a rate that is considered reasonable only to have the plan premiums become unreasonable over time. Failure to keep the average age of the members in the plan low or a higher incidence of illness could be the reason.\n\tThe employer must keep track of the factors contributing to premium increases. Inflation related to medical benefits has in recent years resulted in plan costs increasing beyond the regular cost-of-living index. This is particularly true with plans covering prescription drugs. The cost of this coverage has dramatically increased over the past 15-20 years. Constant review of benefits, benefit levels, employees covered by the plan, and competitive rates for alternative plans must take place. It has become common for plans to move away from \u201cfirst dollar\u201d medical benefits and to incorporate deductibles, waiting periods, and other cost-saving features. An obvious factor to review is the cost of alternative plans. Would it be financially sound to use an alternative insurance plan or an alternative method of delivering the benefits, such as a health maintenance organization (HMO) or a preferred provider organization (PPO)?\n\nLoss Should Be Accidental from the Standpoint of the Insured\n\tThe insurance company does not want to pay for a loss if it is intentionally caused by the insured. This can be a serious problem in most forms of insurance. Arson and fake automobile accidents in property and liability insurance would be examples. In the life and health insurance area, false life and health claims, excess or overuse of drugs and medical tests could fall into this category. This type of problem can be reduced or eliminated by the use of policy provisions or by restricting the available plans or benefits made available to employees. The push toward \u201cconsumer\u0002directed\u201d health plans is partially an attempt to encourage employees to become more selective and aware of the importance of cost control in benefit selection.\n\nInsurable Risk Summary\n\tInsurance companies consider providing insurance to employee benefit plans if they meet the minimum standards of an insurable risk. Benefit plans in general fit the minimum standards as set forth above. Such plans would include life insurance, medical and dental insurance, disability income, and retirement programs. Policy provisions, benefit restrictions, and reinsurance can be used to help alleviate problems to the extent they exist. Life insurance is probably the best example of a plan that meets all the desirable standards of an insurable risk. Disability income, although normally insurable, creates more of a problem from an insurability stand\u0002point. Although not a common employee benefit, excess unemployment insurance would be a benefit that borders on being uninsurable.\n\nHandling Adverse Selection\n\tAdverse selection is the phenomenon in the insurance mechanism where by individuals who have higher-than-average potentially insurable risks \u201cselect against\u201d the insurer. That is, those with greater probabilities of loss, and who therefore need insurance more than the average insured, attempt to obtain the coverage. For example, people who need hospitalization or surgical coverage seek to purchase medical insurance, those who own property subject to possible loss by fire or flood attempt to obtain some form of property insurance, and individuals who own valuable jewelry or objects of art want to purchase appropriate coverage for those items. This tendency can result in a disproportionate number of insureds who experience losses that are greater than those anticipated. Thus, the actual losses can be greater than the expected losses. Because adverse selection is of concern to insurers for both individual and group contracts, certain safeguards generally are used in each case to prevent it from happening.\n\tUnder a block of individual insurance contracts, the desirable situation for an insurance company is to have a spread of risks throughout a range of acceptable insureds. The so-called spread ideally will include some risks that are higher and some that are lower than the average risk within the range. Insurers attempt to control adverse selection by the use of sophisticated underwriting methods used to select and classify appli\u0002cants for insurance and by supportive policy provisions, such as suicide clauses in life insurance policies and the exclusion of certain types of losses under homeowners policies.\n\tThe management of adverse selection under group insurance contracts necessarily is different from the approach used in individual insurance. Group insurance is based on the group as a unit and, typically, individual insurance eligibility requirements are not used for the group insurance underwriting used in employee benefit plans. As an alternative, the group technique itself is used to control the problem of adverse selection. The characteristics of the group technique are covered in Chapter 1 of this Handbook in the discussion of the factors that have contributed to the development of employee benefits, and again in Chapter 14 in the context of its application to group life insurance contracts.\n\nSelf-Funding/Self-lnsurance\n\tSelf-funding, or self-insurance, is a common method of providing financing for employee benefit plans. Essentially, this means that the organization is retaining the risk. It is important to realize, however, that many of the activities performed by the insurance company under an insured plan still have to be done. The identical problems associated with insurable risks for an insurance company exist for the firm that is self-funding or self-insuring. Therefore, the characteristics of an ideally insurable risk would be just as important for those firms that use self-funding as they are for an insurance company. The mechanism used for funding is not directly related to the question of whether a risk is a good one to include in the benefit plan. One should realize that generally only large firms with many employees would be able to meet all the characteristics of the ideally insurable risk. It is not uncommon to find that firms that say they self-fund or self-insure have, \n\tin fact, some arrangement with an insurance company or companies to insure part or all of a particular benefit. Many firms use insurance to provide backup coverage for catastrophic losses or coverage for losses the firm feels cannot be self-funded. The self-funded or self-insured plan has most of the characteristics found in the definition of insurance and has many of the same problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 370 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Health Insurance Benefits\n    The type of protection afforded employees depends on the kinds of benefits being provided and the way in which they are paid. Payment may be through insurance premiums, via a trust or fund, or directly from the employer. Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage or incur costs such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nHealth insurance\n    Health insurance may be an umbrella for medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits, although each of these may also be separate plans or part of a cafeteria plan (see KB-1 Topic 2000). In addition, specific benefits such as mental health, substance abuse management, and prescription drugs, although often part of the health plan, are receiving separate attention due to escalating costs and societal concerns.\n    Medical. Medical coverage protects employees and their families from the total cost burden of the treatment of disease, illness, pregnancy and birth, or accidents and the prevention of disease. Medical. plans cover care delivered in hospitals, physicians' offices, and outpatient settings. Increasingly, the cost of the coverage is shared between employers and employees through employee contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n    Dental. Dental plans cover treatment and preventive care of the teeth, gums, and mouth. Coverage normally is provided through insured plans, self-insured plans, and health maintenance organizations. Plan design varies for certain types of care, such as orthodontia, preventive mali:i.tenance, cosmetic and voluntary procedures, and for coinsurance percentages (see KB-1 Topic 385).\n    Vision. A vision plan is not a common benefit, although certain injuries to eyes may be covered under most medical plans. A vision benefit plan could underwrite the cost of eye examinations, eyeglasses or contact lenses, and eye surgery. Some provide discounted prices for eyeglasses and examinations (see KB-1 Topic 390).\n    Hearing. Separate hearing benefit plans occur in a few union plans, but are a rarity. The plans provide payment for the diagnosis, fitting, and purchase of hearing aids and the treatment of hearing loss.\n    Mental health. Mental health coverage is usually part of the medical plan, although some companies have provided employee assistance programs (EAPs), preferred provider networks (PPOs), and managed care counselling to facilitate treatment outside the traditional medical plan. The benefit plan generally covers a certain number of days per year in an inpatient setting or pays a portion of the cost of outpatient treatment for a specified number of visits to a licensed provider.\n    Pointer: Annual and lifetime dollar limits can be no more restrictive than the limits for medical/surgical coverage. In the past, the Mental Health Parity Act contained a sunset provision. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the mental health parity provisions will no longer expire. In addition, the provisions have been enhanced and substance abuse coverage has been added. For more information, see r 400.\n    Substance abuse management. \u00b7treatment for substance abuse has also become a growth industry and a problem for employers. Inpatient detoxification is normally part of the medical plan or health maintenance organization coverage (see KB-1 Topic 405). However, ongoing outpatient therapy often is arranged on an exception basis by the insurer and the employer, using a case manager as an intermediary (see r 960).\n    Prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is part of most medical plans. Independent drug plans, however, have become a popular alternative for larger companies as an adjunct to the medical plan. These offer generic drug substitution at prices lower than available over the counter and are often done on a mail-order basis. Prescription drug plans can produce cost savings for beneficiaries undergoing long-term therapies to treat illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure (see r 380).\n \nPayment mechanisms\n    Benefits may be insured, partially insured, or self-insured. Further, they are funded, self-funded, or unfunded. This terminology refers to the manner in which an employer shares the risk of the cost of claims and pays for the coverage (see also KB-1 Topic 500).\n\nInsured benefits\n    Medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits may be fully insured through insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, health mainte\u00ad nance organizations, preferred provider networks, associations, or welfare funds.\n    Fully insured benefits. When benefits are fully insured, the insurer estimates the total claim liability for all employees and beneficiaries and adds the projected cost for expenses such as administration, marketing, accounting reserves and trend to develop a cost for the plan year. This estimate represents the total cost for the employer for the plan year. The insurer absorbs any charges above the amount and profit when the total costs are below the estimate. The employer remits a premium on a monthly basis to the insurer.\n    Partially insured arrangement. Under a partially insured arrangement, a portion of estimated claims is insured, usually under stop loss policies, while the rest of the claims are paid on a self-insured basis.\n    Self-insured benefits. An employer that self-insures reimburses the claim payer for claims as they come due or on a delayed basis under agreement with the claim payer. In a self-insured arrangement, the employer assumes the responsibility for the entire cost of paying and processing the claims. A company contracting with an outside provider, such as a managed care vendor or mail-order drug supplier, may negotiate a contract involving minimal risk on either party and pay a charge based on the number of participants per month or on a formula representing the actual costs.\n\nFunding\n    Regardless of whether benefits are provided through insurance or self-insurance, the employer may fully or partially fund the benefits. A fully funded plan involves setting aside anticipated claim costs on a regular basis, sometimes using a trust. An unfunded plan would deduct claim costs from the general assets of the employer on an as-needed basis, with no advance reserving or budgeting. Sometimes funding arrangements are negotiated that involve a delay in remitting payment, subject to an interest charge.\n    A smaller employer is more likely to fully insure and fully fund a welfare benefit program, while larger companies tend to self-insure and self-fund, often with some form of stop-loss insurance as protection against catastrophic claims (see KB-1 Topic 470).\n \nEmployee cost participation\n    Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of insurance. In addition, employees often share in the cost of benefits through deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments (see KB-1 Topic 375).\n\nFor more information ...\n    Employer funding of health plans is discussed at KB-1 Topic 455.\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Preferred-Provider Organizations\n\n\tA concept that continues to receive considerable attention from employers and insurance companies is the preferred-provider organization. A few PPOs existed on a small scale for many years, but since the early 1980s PPOs have grown steadily in number and in membership. Today, PPOs provide coverage for medical expenses to more Americans than do HMOs, primarily because of the flexibility of covered persons to choose their own medical providers.\n\nWhat Is a PPO?\npreferred-provider organization (PPO)\n\tThe term preferred-provider organization (PPO) tends to be used in two ways. One way is to apply it to health care providers that contract with employers, insurance companies, union trust funds, third-party administrators, or others to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. Using this definition, a PPO may be organized by the providers themselves or by other organizations, such as insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, or employers. Like HMOs, they may take the form of group practices or separate individual practices. They may provide a broad array of medical services, including physicians' services, hospital care, laboratory costs, and home health care, or they may be limited only to hospitalization or physicians' services. Some of these organizations are very specialized and provide specific services, such as dental care, mental health benefits, substance abuse services, maternity care, or prescription drugs. This book refers to these providers not as PPOs but as preferred providers or network providers.\n\tThe second use of the term PPO, and the one generally assumed when the term is used throughout this book, is to apply it to benefit plans that contract with preferred providers to obtain lower-cost care for plan members. PPOs typically differ from HMOs in several respects. First, the PPO generally pays the preferred providers on a fee-for-service basis as their services are used. However, fees are usually subject to a schedule that is the same for all similar providers within the provider network, and providers may have an incentive to control utilization through bonus arrangements. Second, employees and their dependents are not required to use the practitioners or facilities that contract with the PPO; rather, they can make a choice each time medical care is needed, and the PPO also pays benefits for care provided that nonnetwork providers furnish. However, employees have incentives to use network providers; they include lower or reduced deductibles and copayments as well as increased benefits, such as preventive health care. Third, most PPOs do not use a primary care physician as a gatekeeper; employees do not need referrals to see specialists.\n\tEmployers were disappointed with some of the early PPOs. Although discounts were available to members, they seemed to have little effect on benefit costs because discounts were from higher-than-average fees, or providers were more likely to perform diagnostic tests or prolong hospital stays to generate additional fees to compensate for the discounts. These PPOs seldom lasted long. Successful PPOs today emphasize quality care and utilization review. In selecting physicians and hospitals, PPOs look both at the type of care provided and the provider's cost effectiveness. In this era of fierce competition among medical care providers, these physicians and hospitals are often willing to accept discounts in hopes of increasing patient volume. It is also important for a PPO to monitor and control utilization on an ongoing basis and to deal with groups of preferred providers that monitor their own costs and utilization. Generally, however, PPOs do not monitor their preferred providers as closely as HMOs do.\n\nVariations\n\tOver time, PPOs have continued to evolve. A few PPOs compensate providers on a capitation basis, and a few others perform a gatekeeper function. If a member's primary care physician does not recommend a specialist, PPO benefits may be reduced. With these changes, it is sometimes difficult to determine the exact form of a managed care organization. However, those that operate as traditional HMOs generally provide medical expense coverage at a slightly lower cost than do those that operate as traditional PPOs, but there are wide variations among HMOs as well as among PPOs. Therefore, a careful analysis of quality of care, cost, and financial stability is necessary before the selection of a particular HMO or PPO.\n\nexclusive-provider organization (EPO)\n\tAnother variation of the PPO is the exclusive-provider organization, or EPO. The primary difference is that an EPO does not provide coverage outside the preferred-provider network, except in emergencies and those infrequent cases when the network does not contain an appropriate specialist. This aspect of an EPO makes it very similar to an HMO. The number of EPOs is small.\n\nSponsorship\n\tInsurance companies and the Blues established most of the early PPOs to provide products to compete with HMOs. In the early part of this decade, the number of PPOs grew significantly to over 1,000. However, primarily because of mergers, the number has decreased. The majority are still owned by insurance companies and the Blues. Some are owned by HMOs to give them another product in their health plan portfolios to offer employers. Others have a variety of ownership forms, including third-party administrators, private investors, and groups of physicians and/or hospitals.\n\nBenefit Structure\ncenters of excellence\n\tThe basic benefit structure of a PPO is very similar to that of the traditional comprehensive major medical contract. The most significant difference is that there is a higher level of benefits for care received from network providers than there is for care received from nonnetwork providers. Many PPOs have extensive networks of preferred providers, particularly in the geographic areas in which they operate, and there is little reason to seek care outside the network. Some of these PPOs also have reciprocity agreements elsewhere with networks of other PPOs and hospitals (called centers of excellence) that have excellent outcomes and reputations for certain types of medical procedures, such as cancer treatment, organ transplants, or burn treatment. Under these agreements, the PPO pays benefits as if a member receives care from network providers. Other PPOs have more limited networks, and the need and desire for treatment from nonnetwork providers is greater.\n\tThe level of benefits under PPOs may vary because of differences in deductibles, coinsurance, and precertification rules. There may also be a few additional benefits that are available only if a member receives care from a network provider. Finally, the procedures for filing claims also differ. The major purpose of these differences is to encourage an employee or dependent to receive care from preferred providers who agree to charge the plan a discounted fee.\n\nDeductibles\n\tA PPO may have annual deductibles that apply separately to network and nonnetwork charges. For examples, these might be $500 and $1,000, respectively. However, some PPOs have no deductible for network charges. A PPO may waive deductibles for some medical services, such as emergency services.\n\nCoinsurance\n\tPPOs often use coinsurance percentages that are 20 percent (and occasionally 30 percent) lower when a member receives care from nonnetwork providers. A frequently found provision applies 90 percent coinsurance to network charges and 70 percent coinsurance to nonnetwork charges. Coinsurance provisions of 100/80, 90/80, 100/70, and 80/60 are also commonly used. As with deductibles, a PPO may waive the percentage participation for certain medical services. In addition, different stop-loss limits or coinsurance caps, such as $1,000 and $3,000, may apply to network and nonnetwork charges.\n\tAlthough PPOs typically have higher coinsurance percentages for network charges than do traditional major medical plans, a covered person may be responsible for copayments in some circumstances. For example, there might be a copayment, typically ranging from $10 to $25, for each a visit to a primary care physician.\n\nallowable charge\n\tIn evaluating PPOs, it is important to determine the basis the PPO uses to apply the coinsurance percentage. For example, assume a plan uses 80 percent coinsurance for nonnetwork charges and that a charge of $100 is incurred for a medical procedure from a nonnetwork provider. Most PPOs first determine whether this charge is usual, customary, and reasonable. If it is, the plan pays $80. If the plan determines that the usual, customary, and reasonable charge is $90, it will be 80 percent of that amount, or $72. However, some plans apply the coinsurance percentage to what they often refer to as an allowable charge. In most cases, this is the amount that the PPO pays to network providers for the same procedure. In some cases, network discounts are quite large and, for example, the allowable charge in this example might be only $60. For a nonnetwork charge, the plan pays 80 percent of this amount, or $48. Thus the insured has an out-of-pocket expense of $52. Few employees and their families will seek nonnetwork care under this type of plan. For this reason, plans that pay nonnetwork charges on this basis are sometimes referred to as phantom PPOs.\n\nPrecertification Rules\n\tPPOs often have precertification requirements for many types of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, and medical supplies. For network benefits, the person responsible for obtaining the needed certification is the network provider, and the PPO does not penalize a member if the network provider fails to obtain the proper precertification. (This becomes an issue between the PPO and the provider.) However, this responsibility shifts to the employee or family member for nonnetwork services. If he or she does not obtain a required precertification, there usually is a reduction in benefits. For example, what was once 80 percent coinsurance might shrink to 60 percent.\n\nAdditional Network Benefits\n\tFor the most part, PPOs pay benefits for the same medical procedures, whether a network or a nonnetwork provider performs them. However, some PPOs cover a few procedures only if a member receives them from network providers.\n\nClaims\n\tNo claim forms are required for network services. The covered person merely pays any required copayment, and the provider of medical services does the paperwork needed to receive the additional amounts payable by the plan. Just as in traditional major medical plans, it is the ultimate responsibility of the covered person to file the claims forms necessary to receive benefits for nonnetwork care. Of course, the provider may do much of the paperwork and accept an assignment of benefits.\n\nExample\nThe following table shows excerpts of the benefit structure from a sample PPO.\n\nTable 9-2 Selected Benefits under a Sample PPO\n\tNetwork Benefit\tNonnetwork Benefit\nDeductible\tNone\t$500 per person per year.

In fact, they were largely unregulated. As a result, the NAIC created the Preferred Provider Arrangements Model Act, which the majority of states adopted. The act is relatively brief and establishes only a minimal regulatory framework. The act requires that PPOs incorporate cost-containment mechanisms, such as utilization review, to determine whether a service is medically necessary. Covered persons must have reasonable access to medical services. The act also allows PPOs to provide incentives for persons to use the preferred-provider network and to place limitations on the number and types of providers with whom they contract.\n\tNote that most PPO contracts also meet the definition of insurance and are subject to the same regulation by state insurance departments as traditional insurance contracts with respect to contract provisions and benefit mandates.\n\n\n \n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Health Maintenance Organizations\n\nhealth maintenance organization (HMO)\n           A health maintenance organization (HMO) is an organized system of health care that provides a comprehensive array of medical services on a prepaid basis to voluntarily enrolled persons living within a specified region. HMOs act like insurance companies and the Blues in that they finance health care. However, unlike insurance companies and the Blues, they also deliver medical services.\n\n           For many years, prepaid group practice plans (as HMOs were once called) operated successfully in many parts of the country. However, growth was relatively slow until the passage of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. This act resulted from a belief on the part of the federal government that HMOs were a viable alternative method of financing and delivering health care and thus should be encouraged. In fact, the act also resulted in many employers being required to offer their employees the option of coverage by an HMO instead of by a more traditional medical expense plan. There are approximately 550 HMOs in existence, with the 1O largest plans enrolling about 25 percent of all HMO participants.\n\nCharacteristics of HMOs\n            HMOs have several characteristics that distinguish them from traditional medical expense contracts that insurance companies and the Blues offer.\n\nComprehensive Care\n            HMOs offer their members a comprehensive package of health care services, generally including benefits for outpatient services as well as for hospitalization. In the past, members usually got many of these services at no cost except the periodically required premium. However, in today's environment, they typically impose a copayment for certain services. For example, the copayment for physician office visits is usually in the range of $10 to $25. Some HMOs also have an annual deductible that might apply to most services or to hospitalization only.\n\n            HMOs emphasize preventive care and include such services as routine physicals and immunizations. The cost of such preventive care was historically not covered under the contracts of insurance companies or the Blues, even when major medical coverage was provided.\n\nDelivery of Medical Services\n             HMOs provide for the delivery of medical services, which in some cases is performed by salaried physicians and other personnel employed by the HMO. Although this approach is in contrast to the usual fee-for-service delivery system of medical care, some HMOs do contract with providers on a fee-for-service basis.\n\n             Members must obtain their care from providers of medical services who have affiliation with the HMO. Because HMOs often operate in a geographic region no larger than one state or a single metropolitan area, this requirement may result in limited coverage for members if they receive treatment elsewhere. Most HMOs do have \"out-of-area coverage,\" but usually only in the case of medical emergencies.\n\n\ndirect-access HMO\n             HMOs emphasize treatment by primary care physicians to the greatest extent possible. These practitioners provide a gatekeeper function and historically have controlled access to specialists. The traditional HMO covers benefits provided by a specialist only if the primary care physician recommends the specialist. This specialist may be a fellow employee in a group-practice plan or a physician who has a contract with the HMO. The member has little or no say regarding the specialist selected, which has been one of the more controversial aspects of HMOs and one that has discouraged larger enrollment. In response\nto consumer concerns, many HMOs now make the process of seeing a specialist easier. Referrals can often be made by nurses in physicians' offices or by staff members of the HMO whom members can contact by telephone. Some HMOs, referred to as direct-access (or self-referral) HMOs, allow members to see network specialists without going through a gatekeeper. However, the specialist may have to contact the HMO for authorization before proceeding with tests or treatment. A variation of an HMO, called a POS plan, allows even more choice.\n\nCost Control\n            A major emphasis of HMOs is the control of medical expenses. By providing and encouraging preventive care, HMOs attempt to detect and treat medical conditions at an early stage, thereby avoiding expensive medical treatment in the future. HMOs have also attempted to provide treatment on an outpatient basis whenever possible. Because insurance companies and the Blues have provided more comprehensive coverage for a hospitalized person in the past, less expensive outpatient treatments were often not performed. This emphasis on outpatient treatment and preventive medicine has resulted in\na lower hospitalization rate for HMO members than for the population as a whole. However, some of this decreased hospitalization rate over the years appears to be a result of younger and healthier employees having been more likely to elect HMO coverage. This increased emphasis on outpatient treatment has resulted in HMOs often providing better coverage than other types of plans for mental health, alcoholism, or drug addiction if a member receives the treatment outside a hospital setting. However, if the member needs hospitalization, HMOs may have more limited benefits than other types of plans.\n\n            HMOs practice a greater degree of utilization management and control than do other types of health plans. In addition to the usual types of prospective review, such as hospital preadmission certification or second surgical opinions, other techniques are often used, such as controlled access to specialists by gatekeepers and preauthorization for certain outpatient procedures. Note that the burden for obtaining preadmission certification or preauthorization for medical procedures lies with the plan physician, not the plan member. This is in contrast to traditional medical expense plans and nonnetwork PPO coverage, where that responsibility is on the plan member.\n\n            HMOs are more likely than other types of health plans to conduct a high degree of concurrent management while patients are hospitalized. In addition, HMOs closely monitor the practice patterns of physicians. If a physician, for example, orders a higher-than-average number of diagnostic tests or admits a disproportionate number of patients to hospitals, the HMO reviews the situation with the physician to determine whether the physician follows proper practice. If the physician does not, the HMO may help the physician adopt better standards.\n\n             Physicians sometimes are not aware of all alternatives to hospitalization or that the medical community has changed its standards regarding the effectiveness and frequency of some diagnostic tests. Working with the physician may result in an effective change in practice patterns or, in extreme cases, the termination of the physician from the plan. HMOs that monitor practice patterns closely may also contact physicians who do not seem to be ordering enough diagnostic tests or who provide lower-than-usual amounts of preventive care.\n\n             HMOs also tightly control payments to physicians and other providers of medical services. In some cases, these providers are employees of the HMO. In other cases, HMOs control providers' compensation by capitation or by other arrangements under which the providers share some of the risk for costs that exceed certain levels.\n\n\nSponsorship of HMOs\nphysician-hospital organizations (PHOs)\n             Traditionally, most HMOs operated as nonprofit organizations and had the majority of members until a few years ago. Most new HMOs are profit making, and the majority of members have coverage under this type of organization. Many members are covered by plans that insurance companies or the Blues sponsor. Sponsorship may also come from physicians, hospitals, labor unions, consumer groups, or private investors. Some recently established HMOs have been formed by physician-hospital organizations (PHOs). A PHO is a legal entity that is formed by one or more physicians' groups and hospitals. It negotiates, contracts, and markets the services of the physicians and the hospitals. PHOs may form their own HMOs, or they may contract with existing HMOs or other types of managed care organizations.\n\n             The issue of whether insurance companies and the Blues should be involved with HMOs was once a source of disagreement within the industry. Some insurance companies viewed HMOs as competitors with the potential of putting them out of the health insurance business. Other insurance companies viewed them as a viable alternative method of financing and delivering health care that they can offer to employers as one of the products in their portfolio.\n\n             Over time, the latter viewpoint prevailed. In addition to actually sponsoring and owning HMOs, some insurance companies are actively involved with them in a variety of ways. These include\n\u2022 consulting on such matters as plan design and administration\n\u2022 administrative services, such as actuarial advice, claims monitoring, accounting, and computer services\n\u2022 marketing assistance, such as designing sales literature. In a few cases, the agents of insurance companies are used to market HMOs in conjunction with the marketing of the insurance company's hospitalization plan when the HMO does not provide hospitalization coverage to its members.\n\u2022 providing hospitalization coverage. HMOs that do not control their own hospital facilities may provide this benefit by purchasing coverage for their members.\n\u2022 providing emergency out-of-area coverage. An insurance company operating on a national basis may be better equipped to administer these claims than an HMO.\n\u2022 providing financial support in a variety of ways, including reinsurance if an HMO experiences greater-than-expected demand for services and agreements to bail out financially troubled HMOs\n\n\n\nTypes of HMOs\nclosed-panel plans\n           There are several types of HMOs. The earliest plans can best be described as closed-panel plans, under which members must use physicians employed by the plan or by an organization with which it contracts. With most closed-panel plans having many general practitioners, members can usually select their physician from among those accepting new patients and make medical appointments just as if the physician were in private practice. However, there is frequently little choice among specialists because a plan may have a contract with only one physician or a limited number of physicians in a given specialty.\n\n           The three different types of closed-panel plans-staff-model HMOs, group-model HMOs, and network-model HMOs-are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\nopen-panel plans\n           Many newer HMOs have been formed as individual practice associations (IPAs), which are open-panel plans. This type of plan has more flexibility with respect to members choosing physicians and the ability of physicians to participate in the plan. IPAs are slightly more prevalent than closed-panel plans.Some members of HMOs receive their coverage in a variety of ways under mixed-model plans. HMO members may also be in open-ended HMOs or POS plans.\n\n\nStaff-Model HMO\nstaff-model HMO\t\n           Under a staff-model HMO, the HMO owns its own facilities and hires its own physicians. It may own hospitals, laboratories, or pharmacies, or it may contract for these services. The HMO may also have contracts with specialists to treat members if it is not large enough to justify hiring its own specialists in a given medical field.\n\n           Staff-model HMOs pay employees a salary and possibly an incentive bonus. A staff-model HMO offers a great degree of control over costs because it controls the salaries of the physicians who might find themselves unemployed if the HMO is unprofitable or if they do not provide care within the cost and utilization parameters of the HMO.\n\n           Despite the potential for cost savings in staff-model HMOs, few have actually been established, primarily because of high start-up costs and high fixed costs once they are operating.\n\n\nGroup-Model HMO\ngroup-model HMO\t\n            Under a group-model HMO, physicians (and other medical personnel) are employees of another legal entity that has a contractual relationship with the HMO to provide medical services for its members. In most cases, this is an exclusive arrangement and the entity's physicians only treat members of the HMO. These physicians also typically operate out of one or more common facilities.\n\n             Under a group-model plan, the HMO may contract with a single provider of medical services or with different providers for different types of services (for example, one contract for physicians' services and another for hospital services). The HMO often pays for services on a capitation basis, which means that the provider of services gets a predetermined fee per month for each member and must provide any and all covered services for this capitation fee. The fee is independent of how the provider compensates its own employees. Under this arrangement, the provider shares the risk in that it loses money if utilization is higher than expected or increases its profit if utilization is lower than expected. Therefore, the provider has a very real incentive to control costs.\n\n\nIndividual Practice Associations\nindividual practice association (IPA)\n             In an individual practice association (IPA), participating physicians practice individually or in small groups at their own offices. In most cases, these physicians accept both non-HMO patients and HMO members. IPAs are open-panel plans because members choose from a list of participating physicians. The number of physicians participating in this type of HMO is frequently larger than the number participating in group practice plans and may include several physicians within a given specialty. In some geographic areas, most physicians may participate; in other geographic areas, only a relatively small percentage of physicians may participate.\n\n             IPAs use several methods to compensate participating physicians. The most common is a fee schedule based on the services provided to members. To encourage physicians to be cost effective, it is common for plans to have a provision for reducing payments to physicians if the experience of the plan is worse than expected. On the other hand, the physicians may receive a bonus if the experience of the plan is better than expected. Particularly with respect to general practitioners, some IPA plans pay each physician a flat annual amount for each member who has elected to use him or her. For this annual payment, the physician must see these members as often as necessary during the year.\n\n             It is unusual for IPAs to own their own hospitals. Instead, they enter into contracts with local hospitals to provide the necessary services for their members.\n\n\nMixed-Model HMOs\nmixed-model HMO\n           Some HMOs operate as mixed-model HMOs, which means that the organization of the plan is a combination of two or more of the approaches previously described. Such a combination generally occurs as a plan continues to grow. For example, a plan might have been established as a staff-model HMO, and later the HMO decided to expand its capacity or geographic region by adding additional physicians under an IPA arrangement. Some mixed models have also resulted from the merger of two plans that each used a different organizational form.\n\nExtent of HMO Use\n          There are over 67 million employees and dependents covered under HMOs (21.9 percent penetration), with the enrollment varying considerably by geographic region. For example, one state (California) has more than 42 percent of its population enrolled in HMOs, but several other states have enrollments of 5 percent or less. (Reference 23 below) There are also significant variations by metropolitan area, with most members living in large metropolitan areas.\n\n          Some employers offer HMO options only. However, in most cases, employees covered by HMO plans have elected this form of coverage as an alternative to other types of insurance company or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. The administrative details of options that allows choice among different types of plans may be burdensome and expensive for small employers, but they seem to pose few problems for large employers with specialized employee benefit staffs. In many cases, the financial consequences to the employer\nof such an option are insignificant because the employer makes the same contribution on an employee's behalf regardless of which plan an employee selects. The general attitude of employers toward HMOs seems to be somewhat ambivalent: Some employers had been in favor of them, others against, and the majority indifferent. However, according to several recent studies, most employers feel that HMOs have been a very effective technique for controlling benefit costs.\n\n          When there is a choice of medical expense plans, most employees do not elect an HMO option unless there is a financial incentive to do so. However, studies have revealed that employees who have elected HMOs are for the most part satisfied with their choice and are unlikely to switch back to an insurance company plan or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan as long as the HMO option remains available.\n\n\nHealth Maintenance Organization Act of 1973\nHealth Maintenance Organization Act\nfederally qualified HMO\n       \t   The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 has had a significant influence on both the interest in and the growth of HMOs. The act introduced the concept of the federally qualified HMO. For several years after the act's passage, most HMOs were formed to take advantage of this federal qualification, which entitled them to federal grants for feasibility studies and development (including grants to solicit members) and federal loans (or loan guarantees) to assist them in covering initial operating deficits. In addition, many employers were required to make federally qualified HMOs available to their employees until late 1995. Federal qualification also exempted federally qualified HMOs from restrictive laws in many states that had effectively prevented the establishment of HMOs. Such state laws have now essentially disappeared.\n\n           The need now for a federal HMO law is debatable. Most states have similar legislation. Although newer HMOs may forgo federal qualification, many older HMOs still retain that status. They feel that this grants them a \"seal of approval\" from the federal government. In addition, some employers will deal only with federally qualified HMOs. However, this practice is changing as employers are increasingly requiring some type of accreditation (either solely or as an alternative to federal qualification) as their measure of quality. Finally, federal qualification continues to be one way that HMOs can satisfy certain qualifications necessary to provide coverage for Medicare recipients.\n\n            An HMO might have more than one line of business, with some lines being federally qualified and other lines not being federally qualified.\n\n\nRequirements for Federal Qualification\n             To become federally qualified, an HMO must meet certain requirements (set forth in the act) to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. In return for a periodic prepaid fee, an HMO must provide the specific basic benefits to its members at no cost or with nominal copayments. These include the following:\n\u2022 physicians' services, including consultant and referral services, up to 10 percent of which may be provided by physicians who are not affiliated with the HMO\n\u2022 inpatient and outpatient hospital services\n\u2022 medically necessary emergency health services\n\u2022 short-term (up to 20 visits) outpatient mental health services medical treatment and referral services for alcohol or drug abuse or addiction\n\u2022 diagnostic laboratory services and diagnostic and therapeutic radiological services\n\u2022 home health services\n\u2022 preventive health services, such as immunizations, well-baby care, periodic physical examinations, and family-planning services\n\u2022 medical social services, including education in methods of personal health maintenance and in the use of health services\n\nThe HMO may also provide supplemental benefits either as part of its standard benefit package or as optional benefits for which it may charge an additional premium. Some of these include the following:\n\u2022 vision care \n\u2022 hearing care \n\u2022 dental care\n\u2022 additional mental health services \n\u2022 rehabilitative services \n\u2022 prescription drugs\n            In addition to the benefits that either are required or may be included, an HMO must meet certain requirements with respect to its operations. For example, it must have a fiscally sound operation, including provisions against the risk of insolvency. It must also have an ongoing quality assurance program.\n\nContributions\n            Employers who voluntarily offer federally qualified HMOs are required to make nondiscriminatory contributions to the HMOs if they have 25 or more employees who reside in an HMO's service area. Under federal regulations, the following employer contribution practices are considered nondiscriminatory:\n\u2022 The employer may contribute the same amount it contributes to non-HMO alternatives.\n\u2022 The employer's contributions may vary by class of enrollee on the basis of attributes, such as age, gender, and family status, that are reasonable predictors of utilization, experience, costs, or risks. For each enrollee in a class, the employer would contribute the same amount, regardless of the plan that an employee chooses.\n\u2022 The employer may pay the same percentage of the cost of all available health plans.\n\u2022 The employer and an HMO may negotiate a payment schedule that is mutually acceptable as long as it meets the basic criteria for nondiscrimination against employees who enroll in HMOs.\n\nState Regulation\n           The states heavily regulate HMOs. All states have numerous laws that are enforced by various state officials, often including both the insurance and public health commissioners. In many cases, the state legislation largely duplicates the federal HMO act.\n\n            Almost all states have adopted the NAIC Health Maintenance Organization Model Act, which focuses substantially on issues relating to licensing of HMOs and the maintenance of their financial solvency. However, it also addresses numerous other issues, such as the types of activities in which HMOs can engage, the requirement of a quality assurance program, standards for materials given to members, grievance procedures, enrollment periods, and coordination-of-benefits provisions.\n\nHMO Coverage as an Alternative to Major Medical\n            Most HMOs include broad protection for medical expenses. In fact, they often give more comprehensive protection than most major medical plans.\n\n            The table below compares the major medical plan and two HMOs that are offered to the employees of one organization. All three plans are reasonably representative of their respective plan type.\n\n\nTable 9-1 A Sample Comparison: Insured Plan versus HMOs\n\tInsured Comprehensive\nMajor Medical Expense Plan\tGroup-Model HMO\tIndividual Practice Association HMO\nChoice of Physician\tMember may select any licensed physician or surgeon.\tMember selects a personal physician from the medical group, who coordinates and directs all health care needs, including referrals to\nspecialists.\tMembers select a personal primary care physician from\namong the health plan physicians.\nWhere Primary Care and Specialty Care Are Available\tCare is provided in physician's office or outpatient facility.\tCare is provided at four multispecialty centers.\tCare is provided in participating private physicians' offices.\nChoice of Hospitals\tMember may select any accredited hospital-choice depends on where physician\nhas admitting privileges.\tSelection is from participating hospitals.\tSelection is from participating hospitals.\nAnnual Deductible and Coinsurance\tThere is a $500 deductible.

This premium covers all health care costs that the plan will pay during the year based on the design of the plan.\n    If actual costs are lower than premiums. If costs are lower than the amount of the premiums, the insurance company either keeps the difference, returns some of it in the form of a dividend, or credits it against the following year's cost estimates.\n    If actual costs are higher than premiums. If actual costs are higher than the annual premiums, the insurance company is at risk and pays the difference. However, the insurer may increase premiums for the following year to make up the difference.\n\nAdvantages to employers\n    There is a great deal of security when using insurance to fully fund a plan. An employer is protected from the financial impact of catastrophic claims that exceed the budgeted premium amount.\n    This method also allows employers to budget their costs because the number of employees determines the monthly plan cost.\n    The insurance company is the claims payer and is responsible for adjudication of claims and the management of claims appeals.\n\nDisadvantages to employers\n    By using this method, however, an employer gives up any flexibility in funding benefits and has lost the use of the money (and any investment earnings on it).\n    This method also requires the payment of extra margin cost that represents the insurer's profit and marketing costs, as well as state premium taxes.\n    An employer who offers a fully insured plan may have difficulty in modifying any benefit provisions that are mandated by state insurance laws- see KB-1 Topic 640-670.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 12 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - LTC Plan Design\n\nThere are two claims-paying approaches offered by the LTC carriers.\n\nReimbursement versus Disability\n                Under a reimbursement approach, the insured is reimbursed for the actual costs of the covered services received on any given day up to the maximum daily dollar limit stated in the policy. For charges that are less than the daily maximum, the difference is retained by the policy in a \"pool of money\" and can be accessed at a later date. This approach differs from the indemnity/disability model, which provides a daily benefit regardless of the actual charges incurred by the insured. As a general rule, the reimbursement model is less costly than the disability model because claims payments are tied to the services received, rather than being automatically issued once benefit triggers have been met.\n\nCoverage Features\nMost LTC insurance pays benefits for care received in the following settings:\n\u25a0 Nursing homes\n\u25a0 Assisted living facilities\n\u25a0 Adult day care centers\n\u25a0 The claimant's home\n            In addition to this basic coverage, there are core benefits that are included in most policies. These may include benefits for informal care by family members, benefits designed to support care in the home, respite care benefits, or international benefits. There are also optional benefits, which add to flexibility, but also increase premiums, such as inflation provisions, return of premium at death, nonforfeiture benefits, or provisions that allow spouses or family members to share available benefits. Some carriers may extend care coordination services to noninsured family members, thereby providing important resources for employee-caregivers. These are described in detail in the carrier's response to the employer's request for proposal. When selecting a LTC insurance plan, employers should try and strike a balance between meeting their populations' needs and keeping coverage affordable, particularly if the coverage is to be offered on a voluntary basis. The primary determinants of the plan's cost are summarized below.\n\n\nDaily Benefit\n            The daily benefit is the most that may be paid for covered services received on any one day. Since the costs for LTC services vary geographically as well as by type of service provider, employers may wish to offer partici\u00ad pants three to six daily benefit options to choose from at the time of enrollment to ensure that the daily benefit meet the needs of potential applicants. Weekly and monthly benefits may also be available, for additional premium.\n\nLifetime Maximum Benefit\n            The lifetime maximum benefit is the most the LTC insurance policy will pay over the lifetime of the policy. Often, the lifetime maximum benefit (\"pool of money\") is expressed in years, because the total amount is calculated by multiplying the daily benefit by a number of years, usually three or five, although other options may be available.\n\nWaiting Period\n             The policy's waiting (elimination) period works much like a deductible. It is the number of days a claimant must wait after becoming benefit-eligible before benefits are payable. Sometimes, services must be received for a day to count toward the waiting period, but most often the waiting period is expressed as calendar days, with no LTC services required. The most common waiting periods are 60 or 90 days and the longer the waiting period, the lower the cost. In addition, waiting periods based on the receipt of services are less costly than calendar-day waiting periods because they generally take longer to satisfy.\n\nInflation Options\n              LTC insurance is a benefit that an individual may not have to use for many years. Therefore, it is important that coverage keeps pace with inflation.\n\n              An employer's choice of inflation options can also influence the cost of coverage. There are three approaches to inflation available in today's LTC insurance market:\n1. Future purchase option\n2. Automatic benefit increase option\n3. Consumer price index option\n\nFuture Purchase Option\n              Under the future purchase option, an inflation increase will be offered with guaranteed issue on a regular, periodic basis from the employer's plan effective date. Insured individuals are free to elect or decline each offer, with premiums for the increase amount based on their age at time of pur\u00ad chase. Rules for continuing offers vary by carrier.\n              Essentially, this is a \"pay as you go\" approach to inflation and is the least expensive of the three options, at initial enrollment.\n\n\nAutomatic Benefit Increase Option\n              With an automatic benefit increase approach, the insured's daily benefit (as well as the lifetime benefit) automatically increases each year at an annual rate, usually 3, 4, or 5 percent compounded, with no corresponding increase in premium. The increases continue to be made regardless of age or whether the insured is eligible for benefits. It is the option most often recommended by consumer agencies and is required to be offered in all states. However, it is significantly more expensive than the other inflation approaches.\n\nConsumer Price Index Option\n              Under the consumer price index inflation option, inflation increases are based on percentage changes in the All Urban Consumers-All Items-CPI (CPI-U), and automatically increase the insured's daily maximum benefit by the same percentage, with no corresponding increase in premium. This is the most recent approach developed to address inflation and falls between the future purchase and automatic benefit increase options in terms of cost.\n\nUnderwriting\n              The LTC insurance benefit can be offered on a guaranteed issue basis or be underwritten, depending on the size of the employer's population. Larger groups, that is, those with more than 1,000 employees, are the best candidates for guaranteed issue, where simplified or full underwriting is more appropriate for smaller employers or for associations looking to introduce the benefit to their membership. Guaranteed issue adds a small cost to the overall premium structure.\n\n"

This premium is determined by the HMO for the geographic area and includes all health care costs that an employer needs to pay during the year.\n   Pointer: This HMO premium also includes the costs of wellness and preven\u00ad tive medicine that HMOs often sponsor.\n   If costs are lower. If the actual costs are lower than the premiums, the HMO keeps the difference.\n   If costs are higher. However, if the actual costs are higher than the yearly premiums, the HMO is at risk and pays the difference and may increase premiums the following year to make up the difference.\n\nAdvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, there is security in knowing what health care costs are; an employer is protected from catastrophic claims and can budget its costs.\n   The HMO usually does not require claims to be submitted, but rather simply provides the coverage for the pre-established rate.\n   HMOs offer a managed care approach to health care that may result in a lower monthly cost than other insurance arrangements.\n\nDisadvantages for employers\n   As with funding through insurance, the employer has lost flexibility and has tied up its funds. It must also pay the HMO's margin cost that represents its profit and marketing costs.\n   The premium paid to the HMO is not based on the risk characteristics of the employer's own employee group but rather on all people in the geographic area who participate in the HMO. This is because HMOs use community rating (see KB-1 Topic 430). Premium increases for subsequent years are also based on costs incurred by the whole membership.\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 7 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Consumer-Driven Health Plans - Individually Controlled Health Accounts\n           A key element of consumer-driven health care includes a \"personal account\" under the control of the individual. This account can be used for health care expenses, including copayments, deductibles, health care items, or services not covered by the plan. These accounts can be structured in several ways and go by various names. However, to take full advantage of favorable tax treatment, most of these accounts will fall under one of three legally recognized accounts:\n\u25a0 Health flexible spending accounts or arrangements (FSAs)\n\u25a0 HRAs\n\u25a0 HSAs\n\n           Each of these accounts provides tax-advantaged reimbursement for qualified medical expenses as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) prohibits reimbursement for over-the-counter drugs, unless the drug is a prescribed drug or is insulin, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010. Each also provides some degree of employee control over health care spending decisions. Yet, each has distinctive benefits, features, and restrictions. While more than one type of account may be desirable to optimize benefits and tax advantages, there are rules governing the use of multiple accounts. (Reference 5 below)\n           As defined earlier, a CDHP involves an HDHP coupled with either an HRA or an HSA. However, an employee may be eligible for, and enrolled in, more than one type of account. The rules provide:\n\u25a0 An employee covered by a HDHP and either a health FSA or an HRA generally cannot make contributions, or have employer contributions made on their behalf, to an HSA. However, an employee can make contributions to an HSA while covered under an HDHP and a \"limited purpose\" FSA. Limited purpose FSAs cover expenses not otherwise covered by the plan, such as dental or vision care.\n\u25a0 An HRA participant may also have a general purpose FSA, although both accounts cannot be used for the same claim. The employer establishes the priority, which is outlined in the plan document.\n\nCafeteria Plan Health FSAs\n            Health FSAs have been popular since the 1980s and usually operate as part of a \"cafeteria plan,\" as defined under the federal tax code, and so named because these plans allow an employer to offer employees a selection of various benefits. Health FSAs are funded on a pretax basis, usually through salary reduction. Amounts contributed to FSAs are not subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or Federal Unemployment-Tax Act (FUTA) taxes, adding another level of savings for the employer and the employee. The employee, however, may be ambivalent about the impact the FICA exemption has on future Social Security benefits. The big draw\u00adback with FSAs is the \"use-it-or-lose-it\" rule. Health FSAs do not allow unused balances to carry over from year to year. However, plans may per\u00ad mit a grace period of up to two and one-half months after the end of the plan year for remaining balances to be utilized.6 The plan is not permitted to refund any unused balances left in the account. This \"use-it-or-lose-it\" feature of FSAs has long been recognized-and criticized-as punishing the \"thrifty\" employee and encouraging unnecessary health care spending.\n\nHealth Reimbursement Arrangements\n            A few employers began offering HRAs in 2001. By early 2002, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Treasury, were besieged with insurance companies seeking guidance on the tax treatment of a high-deductible health insurance product that would be coupled with an annually funded health care account in which the unused balances could be carried over from year to year. These plans and accounts met with a sympathetic view. And as health care costs began to escalate again after a few years of relatively modest growth, the accounts seemed to make sense.\n\n             The IRS ruled that HRAs paid for solely by the employer and permiting unused amounts to be carried over from year to year would qualify as health benefits exempt from federal income taxes and employment taxes. But the IRS specifically prohibits the use of employee contributions. Contributions cannot be funded through employee salary deferrals under a cafeteria plan. HRAs are notional accounts, meaning they normally are not funded. Claims are paid as incurred, providing an attractive cash flow advantage to the employer.\n\n             HRAs can be used to pay for unreimbursed qualified medical expenses, as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, an employer may limit what expenses are eligible under the HRA. For example, an employer could restrict HRA reimbursements to include only those expenses eligible under the employer's medical plan. Alternatively, the employer could elect to allow HRA use for services not normally covered by the plan, such as dental and vision. The employer may also permit payment of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) or retiree health care plan premiums from balances remaining at termination or retirement.\n\n              HRAs offered proponents of consumer-driven health care plans an opportunity to move forward. Yet these accounts had the considerable disadvantage of allowing only claim payments from employer dollars and did not provide any tax advantages to prefund health care expenses. Employees who needed more tax-favored money to pay out-of-pocket expenses could not supplement the employer account with pretax dollars.\n\nHealth Savings Accounts\n              Consumer-driven health care proponents were finally able to convince Congress that an account funded by employers or employees or both on essentially a tax-free basis could truly provide a boost to consumer-driven health care and increase participants' active involvement, because the participant would see the account as \"my money,\" not the employer's. In 2003, as part of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA), Congress adopted HSAs, and the first plans became available in 2004. The IRS moved quickly to provide additional guidance on their usage.\n\n              Health savings accounts are largely an extension of Archer Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) that were first passed by Congress in 1997. MSAs could be offered only to small employers (fewer than 50 employees) and permitted balances to be carried forward from year to year if coupled with a high-deductible health insurance policy. No other health coverage could be offered by the employer. These accounts were not allowed to be established after 2007 and have essentially been replaced by HSAs.\n\n              When compared with an HRA or a traditional health care flexible spending account offered under a cafeteria plan, HSAs offer much more flexibility in funding and encourage participant savings for future medical expenses. An HSA provides triple tax savings: tax deductible contributions, tax-free interest on investment earnings, and tax-free distributions for qualified medical expenses.\n\n              HSA accounts are fully owned by the employee and have the advantage of portability. The employee has unfettered access to the funds, even for nonmedical purposes. However, distributions for reasons other than qualified medical expenses are subject to income tax as well as an additional 20 percent tax penalty. (Reference 7 below) Claim substantiation requirements differ for HSAs compared to HRAs and FSAs. Under HRAs and FSAs, medical expenses must be substantiated to the HRA or FSA administrator for reim\u00ad bursement. HSA reimbursements may be made without submitting proof that the costs were incurred, but substantiation is required in case of audit. \n\n             Immediate employee ownership and access to funds for nonmedical purposes, while very attractive to employees, may make some employers reluctant to contribute to the account. Yet, employer contributions to the HSA are a good enticement for employees to enroll in an BSA-qualified plan. Unlike HRAs and health FSAs, which can be coupled with any type of health plan or can stand alone as the only employer health benefit, an HSA can be used only if it is coupled with a high-deductible plan that\nmeets specific criteria as outlined in Table 7-1 below.\n\n             Table 7-1 compares the features of HSAs, HRAs, and the long\u00ad established health FSAs.\n\n\nTABLE\t7\u00b71\nComparison of Health Care Accounts\n\t\n\n\nHealth Savings Account (HSA)\tHealth Reim- bursement Arrangement (HRA)\t\nFlexible Spend- ing Account (FSA)\nEligibility Requirements\nWho can set up an account\n\n\n\nl\tIndividuals and employees covered by a qualified HDHP and no other health insurance, except specifically listed coverages.\nCannot be enrolled in Medicare or claimed as a dependent on another's tax return.\tOnly employers.\tOnly employers.\nHealth Plan Requirements\nAecom- panying health plan requirements\tHDHP must meet federal requirements.\n\u25a0\tMinimum deductible*\n$1,200-Self-only coverage\n$2,400-Family coverage\n\u25a0\tMaximum out-of-pocket\u2022\n$5,950-Self-only coverage\n$11,900-Family coverage\n\n\u20222011 amounts; adjusted annually for inflation.\tNone.

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? \n\n\tA medical Flexible Spending Account (also known as a flexible spending arrangement or FSA) is a special account that an employee can put pre-tax money into to pay for certain out-of\u00adpocket health care costs not covered by insurance. Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - What is a Health Savings Account (HSA) and how does it work?\n\n\tHealth savings accounts are an alternative to standard group insurance plans. A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"
