            "prompt": "What is a 'benefits broker'?\n\nRelevant context: KB-3 - Managing Employee Benefits - What is a \"benefits broker\"?\n\n\tA benefits broker is pretty much like any other insurance broker. They can help employers detc1mine what types of benefits work best for them and what plan options are available. In addition, benefit brokers can negotiate with plan providers to try to secure the lowest cost possible. A major advantage of working with benefit brokers is that there's no cost to the employer since brokers are paid in commissions from the plan providers based on the business the broker brings in. KB-5 - Employee Benefit Marketing - Sellers\n\n\tThe sellers of employee benefit products and services consist primarily of insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, PPOs, and third-party administrators. Just as there are certain generalizations about who makes employee benefit decisions within an organization, there are generalizations about where employers purchase products and services. However, the breakdown by size is different.\n\n\tEmployers with fewer than 10 employees, who have more limited choices than larger employers, often purchase coverage from multiple-employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs)-often structured as PPOs for medical expense coverage-or the Blues. However, there are significant geographic differences with respect to the purchase of medical expense coverage. In some geographic areas, the Blues, because of large discounts and community rating, have a significant cost advantage and are the primary providers of coverage. In other areas, the Blues are minor players and provide little coverage to such small employers. In still other areas, a very competitive marketplace exists. Depending on the geographic region, HMO coverage may or may not be readily available.\n\n\tThe choice of products and services increases for employers with 10 to 25 employees. Not only is coverage available from MEWAs and the Blues, but it can also frequently be obtained from HMOs and PPOs. For this size group, insurance companies also have products they sell directly to employers rather than through MEWAs.\n\n\tIf an employer has more than 50 employees, the possibility of self-funding of benefits, particularly medical expense benefits, becomes very real. In this marketplace, there is a significant demand for the purchase of administrative services from insurance companies and third-party administrators.\n\n\tThe following discussion looks at the functions and methods of compensation for each of the participants in the sales process for group benefits.\n\nAgents\n\n\tAn insurance company agent is a legal representative of the company and has certain powers to act on behalf of the insurer. Agents play a major role in marketing group insurance, particularly to groups that have fewer than 100 employees. Agents usually locate the prospective group insurance cases, but the extent of their further involvement in the sales process varies depending on the size of the group. For very small groups, the agent conducts virtually all sales activities. For larger groups, the agent is likely to call on the group representative of the insurance company for assistance in selling, installing, and servicing the case. To many agents, the selling of group insurance is not a specialty but is rather the selling of just another product in the portfolio of their insurance company. Although some agents limit their activities to group insurance sales, most specialists in this area need to sell the products of more than one company and therefore operate as brokers.\n\n\tInsurance companies compensate agents in the form of commission payments. When compared with the commission rates for individual insurance, the commission rates for group insurance are considerably lower. In general, this reflects the fact that the premium on a group insurance contract is usually much larger than the premium on an average-sized individual policy. In addition, the agent often relies on a group representative of the insurance company to perform many of the sales and service activities pertaining to the case.\n\n\tFor multiple-employer trusts, the commission rate is normally 5 to 15 percent of the initial annual premium, depending on the line of insurance. This rate usually remains the same in renewal years, although it may drop slightly. It is becoming increasingly common for small groups to have a commission for medical expense coverage that is a fixed dollar amount per month for each contract.\n\nStandard (Regular) Commission Schedule\n\nLevel Commission Schedule\n\n\tFor other groups, two approaches are used. The larger the group, the more common it is for negotiation between the policyowner, the agent, and the insurance company to determine commissions. However, two basic types of commission schedules also frequently determine commissions. The standard (or regular) commission schedule has high first-year commission rates and lower rates in renewal years. The level commission schedule has the same commission rates for both the first year and any renewal years. These two schedules are typically designed so that over some period of time (often 10 years) the same overall commission is paid for a given amount of premium, regardless of which schedule is used. The following table shows an example of each type of schedule.\n\nTable 13-1 Commission Schedules\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStandard Schedule\nAnnual Premium \t\t\t\tFirst Year\t\tRenewal Years \t\tLevel Schedule\nFirst\t$1,000\t\t\t\t20.0%\t\t\t5.00%\t\t\t6.50%\n\nNext\t4,000\t\t\t\t20.0\t\t\t3.00\t\t\t4.70\n\"\t5,000\t\t\t\t15.0\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t2.85\n\"\tl0,000\t\t\t\t12.5\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t2.60\n\"\t10,000\t\t\t\tl0.0\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t2.35\n\"\t20,000\t\t\t\t5.0\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t1.85\n\"\t200,000\t\t\t\t2.5\t\t\t1.00\t\t\t1.15\n\"\t250,000\t\t\t\t1.0\t\t\t0.50\t\t\t0.55\n\"\t2,000,000\t\t\t0.5\t\t\t0.25\t\t\t0.25\nOver\t2,500,000\t\t\t0.1\t\t\t0.10\t\t\t0.10\n\nNote that these are sliding (or graded) scales based on additional increments of premium volume, not on the total premium volume.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nUsing the regular scale previously shown, the first-year commission on a group case with an annual premium volume of $40,000 is calculated as follows:\n\n$1,000\tX\t20.0%\t$ 200\n4,000\tX\t20.0\t800\n5,000\tX\t15.0\t750\n10,000\tX\t12.5\t1,250\n10,000\tX\t10.0\t1,000\n10,000\tX\t5.0\t500\n \n$40,000\t\t\t$4,500  (or 11.25% of the total premium)\n\n\tAfter the first year, insurers may subdivide the commissions under either of these schedules into selling commissions and service commissions, with the agent who sold the case receiving the latter only if he or she continues to service the case. An agent may voluntarily terminate his or her relationship with the case. In addition, most insurance companies allow the client, with a new agent-of-record letter, to request a change in the servicing agent.\n\n\tIn many cases, the agent may choose either commission schedule. The standard schedule obviously produces a higher income for the agent in early years and generates a larger total income if the employer cancels or fails to renew the policy after a short period. However, the level schedule should be more beneficial if the agent expects substantial increases in premium volume in a case's renewal years. Insurance companies are concerned about using the standard commission schedule when there is a high probability that a group insurance case will either change insurers or lapse. Consequently, many insurers require the use of a level schedule for transferred business, reinstated cases, fully contributory plans, or groups below a certain size. In addition, the level schedule may also be mandatory for very large groups when competitive bidding requires that expenses be held to a minimum and be recoverable in the early years of a contract.\n\nBrokers and Consultants\n\n\tThe majority of large group insurance buyers retain a broker or employee benefit consultant to provide professional advice on group insurance matters and to aid them in dealing with insurance companies. Brokers and consultants are agents of the buyers and owe their allegiance to the buyers rather than to the insurance companies through which they place their clients' coverages. Traditionally, the major distinction between brokers and consultants was that brokers were compensated on a commission basis for the coverages they placed in behalf of clients, whereas consultants were compensated by fees charged to the clients. From a practical standpoint, the distinction between brokers and consultants has become blurred and is now more semantic than real. Generally, those persons or organizations that call themselves brokers operate on a commission basis; however, they also charge fees for advice and services that do not result in the sale of a product. Although some consulting firms still operate solely on a fee basis, many receive commissions from insurance companies for business they have placed for their clients. This may be their sole compensation for placing the coverage (with fees charged for other services), or it may offset the higher fee that a client is charged for this service. The commission schedules insurance companies use for brokers and benefit consultants are usually the same as those used for agents. However, for large cases it is common for the commission to be a negotiated amount.\n\n\tOver the last few years, many insurance companies have lowered the commission rates that they pay. As a result, brokers and consultants are more likely than in the past to do one or both of the following: charge fees for services that they previously performed at no additional cost or increase the fee levels they already charge for services. It should be noted that the Affordable Care Act mandates currently require a broker to sell coverage either directly from an insurer or health plan or act as a navigator through the state health benefit exchanges. The current guidelines state that a broker cannot be paid for both product sources-only one or the other. This guideline is being discussed at the federal level.\n\n\tBrokers who specialize in other types of insurance place some group insurance business. For example, a broker who handles a client's property and liability insurance may also have the opportunity to place group insurance coverages. However, the majority of brokers and consultants who become involved in group sales-ranging from individuals or small local firms to very large national and international firms (or departments or divisions of these firms)-are specialists in the area of group insurance. These large firms, which often also handle their clients' property and liability insurance needs, account for the majority of premium volume that is placed through brokers and consultants, and they are well suited to serving the needs of clients whose organizations are geographically widespread. Many of the employees of these firms are former group representatives.\n\nGroup Representatives\n\n\tThe group representative is an employee of the insurance company who is generally located outside the home office and specializes in the selling and servicing of his or her company's group insurance products. The group representative conducts sales activities through the agents, brokers, and consultants whom the group representative educates and motivates to place group insurance business with his or her company. In addition, the group representative aids the agents, brokers, or consultants in prospecting, securing necessary underwriting data, designing plans, and preparing and presenting group insurance proposals. After a plan is sold, the group representative is frequently involved in the enrolling of eligible employees, the administrative procedures of installing the case, and the providing of services necessary to keep the case in force. Group representatives almost always receive a salary, and most are eligible for bonuses based on performance. Significant variations exist among companies. Some pay a low salary but offer the potential for a bonus that exceeds the salary; others pay a much higher salary and give a much smaller bonus. The bonus is frequently a function of the commissions paid the agents, brokers, or consultants with whom the group representative has dealt. In addition, it may also be a function of the persistency and profitability of the group insurance cases with which the group representative has been involved.\n\nService Plans\n\n\tIntense competition exists among insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, and PPOs for the sale of medical expense coverage. With rare exceptions, the Blues, HMOs, and PPOs not owned by insurers have traditionally marketed their products and services through employees who receive a salary (and possibly a bonus) rather than through agents, brokers, and consultants who receive a commission. One competitive advantage enjoyed by these organizations is that the compensation they pay to their salespersons is usually lower than the commissions that insurance companies pay to agents, brokers, or consultants who produce a comparable volume of business. However, most Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, HMOs, and PPOs now market their products through insurance agents as well as through their own salaried employees. The Blues, HMOs, and PPOs, like the group representatives of insurance companies, have also developed close working relationships with the larger brokerage or employee benefit consulting firms in order to encourage their consideration as a source for placing their clients' coverages. If coverage is placed with the Blues, HMOs, and PPOs, brokers or consultants charge their clients fees, except in those instances when these organizations pay commissions.\n\nThird-Party Administrators (TPA)\n\n\tA third-party administrator (frequently referred to as a TPA) is a person or organization that is hired to provide certain administrative services to group benefit plans. Traditionally, their primary role was to administer plans that were written for associations or negotiated trusteeships. The functions of TPAs include receiving employee reports and contributions, keeping track of employee eligibility, preparing any reports required by state and federal laws, and handling complaints and grievances. In addition, the TPA is involved in certain aspects of the claims process. At a minimum, this probably involves the certification of eligibility and the processing of claims forms for submission to an insurance company, but it may also include paying claims from the trust's funds. Besides professional administrators, TPAs may be banks and insurance companies.\n\n\tTPAs administer many MEWAs, including those of insurance companies. The functions that the TPA performs vary and are subject to negotiations between the TPA and the sponsor of the trust.\n\n\tThe increasing use of alternative funding methods, including total self-funding, has resulted in the need for employers to provide many of the services (such as claims handling) that are performed by an insurance company when traditional fully insured contracts are purchased. When employers have been unable to provide these services themselves in a cost-effective manner, they have often turned to TPAs. In some cases, these TPAs are professionals who specialize solely in these tasks; in other cases, they are brokers, consultants, or insurance companies that market these services to their clients as additional products. Over the last decade, the use of TPAs has increased dramatically, particularly for medical expense benefits. KB-3 - Managing Employee Benefits - Should employers outsource benefit administration?\n\n\tIn general, yes. Benefit administration (especially around open enrollment time) can take a great deal of time and effort-time that could be better spent elsewhere. In today's market, employers should be able to find a capable benefits administrator for a reasonable price, which will allow them to spend their time concentrating on managing daily operations and growing their business. Plus, compliance mistakes can be costly and the best way to avoid them is to leave it to experts in employment law to make sure you stay in compliance with all the current benefit laws and regulations.\n\tPossible providers for administrative services include insurance companies, consulting firms, banks, payroll service companies, and investment brokers. In some cases though, the best option for setting and administering benefits may be a benefits broker.\n",

In addition, most insurance companies allow the client, with a new agent-of-record letter, to request a change in the servicing agent.\n\n\tIn many cases, the agent may choose either commission schedule. The standard schedule obviously produces a higher income for the agent in early years and generates a larger total income if the employer cancels or fails to renew the policy after a short period. However, the level schedule should be more beneficial if the agent expects substantial increases in premium volume in a case's renewal years. Insurance companies are concerned about using the standard commission schedule when there is a high probability that a group insurance case will either change insurers or lapse. Consequently, many insurers require the use of a level schedule for transferred business, reinstated cases, fully contributory plans, or groups below a certain size. In addition, the level schedule may also be mandatory for very large groups when competitive bidding requires that expenses be held to a minimum and be recoverable in the early years of a contract.\n\nBrokers and Consultants\n\n\tThe majority of large group insurance buyers retain a broker or employee benefit consultant to provide professional advice on group insurance matters and to aid them in dealing with insurance companies. Brokers and consultants are agents of the buyers and owe their allegiance to the buyers rather than to the insurance companies through which they place their clients' coverages. Traditionally, the major distinction between brokers and consultants was that brokers were compensated on a commission basis for the coverages they placed in behalf of clients, whereas consultants were compensated by fees charged to the clients. From a practical standpoint, the distinction between brokers and consultants has become blurred and is now more semantic than real. Generally, those persons or organizations that call themselves brokers operate on a commission basis; however, they also charge fees for advice and services that do not result in the sale of a product. Although some consulting firms still operate solely on a fee basis, many receive commissions from insurance companies for business they have placed for their clients. This may be their sole compensation for placing the coverage (with fees charged for other services), or it may offset the higher fee that a client is charged for this service. The commission schedules insurance companies use for brokers and benefit consultants are usually the same as those used for agents. However, for large cases it is common for the commission to be a negotiated amount.\n\n\tOver the last few years, many insurance companies have lowered the commission rates that they pay. As a result, brokers and consultants are more likely than in the past to do one or both of the following: charge fees for services that they previously performed at no additional cost or increase the fee levels they already charge for services. It should be noted that the Affordable Care Act mandates currently require a broker to sell coverage either directly from an insurer or health plan or act as a navigator through the state health benefit exchanges. The current guidelines state that a broker cannot be paid for both product sources-only one or the other. This guideline is being discussed at the federal level.\n\n\tBrokers who specialize in other types of insurance place some group insurance business. For example, a broker who handles a client's property and liability insurance may also have the opportunity to place group insurance coverages. However, the majority of brokers and consultants who become involved in group sales-ranging from individuals or small local firms to very large national and international firms (or departments or divisions of these firms)-are specialists in the area of group insurance. These large firms, which often also handle their clients' property and liability insurance needs, account for the majority of premium volume that is placed through brokers and consultants, and they are well suited to serving the needs of clients whose organizations are geographically widespread. Many of the employees of these firms are former group representatives.\n\nGroup Representatives\n\n\tThe group representative is an employee of the insurance company who is generally located outside the home office and specializes in the selling and servicing of his or her company's group insurance products. The group representative conducts sales activities through the agents, brokers, and consultants whom the group representative educates and motivates to place group insurance business with his or her company. In addition, the group representative aids the agents, brokers, or consultants in prospecting, securing necessary underwriting data, designing plans, and preparing and presenting group insurance proposals. After a plan is sold, the group representative is frequently involved in the enrolling of eligible employees, the administrative procedures of installing the case, and the providing of services necessary to keep the case in force. Group representatives almost always receive a salary, and most are eligible for bonuses based on performance. Significant variations exist among companies. Some pay a low salary but offer the potential for a bonus that exceeds the salary; others pay a much higher salary and give a much smaller bonus. The bonus is frequently a function of the commissions paid the agents, brokers, or consultants with whom the group representative has dealt. In addition, it may also be a function of the persistency and profitability of the group insurance cases with which the group representative has been involved.\n\nService Plans\n\n\tIntense competition exists among insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, and PPOs for the sale of medical expense coverage. With rare exceptions, the Blues, HMOs, and PPOs not owned by insurers have traditionally marketed their products and services through employees who receive a salary (and possibly a bonus) rather than through agents, brokers, and consultants who receive a commission. One competitive advantage enjoyed by these organizations is that the compensation they pay to their salespersons is usually lower than the commissions that insurance companies pay to agents, brokers, or consultants who produce a comparable volume of business. However, most Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, HMOs, and PPOs now market their products through insurance agents as well as through their own salaried employees. The Blues, HMOs, and PPOs, like the group representatives of insurance companies, have also developed close working relationships with the larger brokerage or employee benefit consulting firms in order to encourage their consideration as a source for placing their clients' coverages. If coverage is placed with the Blues, HMOs, and PPOs, brokers or consultants charge their clients fees, except in those instances when these organizations pay commissions.\n\nThird-Party Administrators (TPA)\n\n\tA third-party administrator (frequently referred to as a TPA) is a person or organization that is hired to provide certain administrative services to group benefit plans. Traditionally, their primary role was to administer plans that were written for associations or negotiated trusteeships. The functions of TPAs include receiving employee reports and contributions, keeping track of employee eligibility, preparing any reports required by state and federal laws, and handling complaints and grievances. In addition, the TPA is involved in certain aspects of the claims process. At a minimum, this probably involves the certification of eligibility and the processing of claims forms for submission to an insurance company, but it may also include paying claims from the trust's funds. Besides professional administrators, TPAs may be banks and insurance companies.\n\n\tTPAs administer many MEWAs, including those of insurance companies. The functions that the TPA performs vary and are subject to negotiations between the TPA and the sponsor of the trust.\n\n\tThe increasing use of alternative funding methods, including total self-funding, has resulted in the need for employers to provide many of the services (such as claims handling) that are performed by an insurance company when traditional fully insured contracts are purchased. When employers have been unable to provide these services themselves in a cost-effective manner, they have often turned to TPAs. In some cases, these TPAs are professionals who specialize solely in these tasks; in other cases, they are brokers, consultants, or insurance companies that market these services to their clients as additional products. Over the last decade, the use of TPAs has increased dramatically, particularly for medical expense benefits. KB-3 - Managing Employee Benefits - Should employers outsource benefit administration?\n\n\tIn general, yes. Benefit administration (especially around open enrollment time) can take a great deal of time and effort-time that could be better spent elsewhere. In today's market, employers should be able to find a capable benefits administrator for a reasonable price, which will allow them to spend their time concentrating on managing daily operations and growing their business. Plus, compliance mistakes can be costly and the best way to avoid them is to leave it to experts in employment law to make sure you stay in compliance with all the current benefit laws and regulations.\n\tPossible providers for administrative services include insurance companies, consulting firms, banks, payroll service companies, and investment brokers. In some cases though, the best option for setting and administering benefits may be a benefits broker.\n. Please be concise.",
            "response": "As a knowledgeable assistant, answer the following question: What is a 'benefits broker'?\n\nBased on the context: KB-3 - Managing Employee Benefits - What is a \"benefits broker\"?\n\n\tA benefits broker is pretty much like any other insurance broker.

In addition, benefit brokers can negotiate with plan providers to try to secure the lowest cost possible. A major advantage of working with benefit brokers is that there's no cost to the employer since brokers are paid in commissions from the plan providers based on the business the broker brings in. KB-5 - Employee Benefit Marketing - Sellers\n\n\tThe sellers of employee benefit products and services consist primarily of insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, PPOs, and third-party administrators. Just as there are certain generalizations about who makes employee benefit decisions within an organization, there are generalizations about where employers purchase products and services. However, the breakdown by size is different.\n\n\tEmployers with fewer than 10 employees, who have more limited choices than larger employers, often purchase coverage from multiple-employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs)-often structured as PPOs for medical expense coverage-or the Blues. However, there are significant geographic differences with respect to the purchase of medical expense coverage. In some geographic areas, the Blues, because of large discounts and community rating, have a significant cost advantage and are the primary providers of coverage. In other areas, the Blues are minor players and provide little coverage to such small employers. In still other areas, a very competitive marketplace exists. Depending on the geographic region, HMO coverage may or may not be readily available.\n\n\tThe choice of products and services increases for employers with 10 to 25 employees.

In this marketplace, there is a significant demand for the purchase of administrative services from insurance companies and third-party administrators.\n\n\tThe following discussion looks at the functions and methods of compensation for each of the participants in the sales process for group benefits.\n\nAgents\n\n\tAn insurance company agent is a legal representative of the company and has certain powers to act on behalf of the insurer. Agents play a major role in marketing group insurance, particularly to groups that have fewer than 100 employees. Agents usually locate the prospective group insurance cases, but the extent of their further involvement in the sales process varies depending on the size of the group. For very small groups, the agent conducts virtually all sales activities. For larger groups, the agent is likely to call on the group representative of the insurance company for assistance in selling, installing, and servicing the case. To many agents, the selling of group insurance is not a specialty but is rather the selling of just another product in the portfolio of their insurance company. Although some agents limit their activities to group insurance sales, most specialists in this area need to sell the products of more than one company and therefore operate as brokers.\n\n\tInsurance companies compensate agents in the form of commission payments. When compared with the commission rates for individual insurance, the commission rates for group insurance are considerably lower. In general, this reflects the fact that the premium on a group insurance contract is usually much larger than the premium on an average-sized individual policy. In addition, the agent often relies on a group representative of the insurance company to perform many of the sales and service activities pertaining to the case.\n\n\tFor multiple-employer trusts, the commission rate is normally 5 to 15 percent of the initial annual premium, depending on the line of insurance. This rate usually remains the same in renewal years, although it may drop slightly. It is becoming increasingly common for small groups to have a commission for medical expense coverage that is a fixed dollar amount per month for each contract.\n\nStandard (Regular) Commission Schedule\n\nLevel Commission Schedule\n\n\tFor other groups, two approaches are used. The larger the group, the more common it is for negotiation between the policyowner, the agent, and the insurance company to determine commissions. However, two basic types of commission schedules also frequently determine commissions. The standard (or regular) commission schedule has high first-year commission rates and lower rates in renewal years. The level commission schedule has the same commission rates for both the first year and any renewal years. These two schedules are typically designed so that over some period of time (often 10 years) the same overall commission is paid for a given amount of premium, regardless of which schedule is used. The following table shows an example of each type of schedule.\n\nTable 13-1 Commission Schedules\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStandard Schedule\nAnnual Premium \t\t\t\tFirst Year\t\tRenewal Years \t\tLevel Schedule\nFirst\t$1,000\t\t\t\t20.0%\t\t\t5.00%\t\t\t6.50%\n\nNext\t4,000\t\t\t\t20.0\t\t\t3.00\t\t\t4.70\n\"\t5,000\t\t\t\t15.0\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t2.85\n\"\tl0,000\t\t\t\t12.5\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t2.60\n\"\t10,000\t\t\t\tl0.0\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t2.35\n\"\t20,000\t\t\t\t5.0\t\t\t1.50\t\t\t1.85\n\"\t200,000\t\t\t\t2.5\t\t\t1.00\t\t\t1.15\n\"\t250,000\t\t\t\t1.0\t\t\t0.50\t\t\t0.55\n\"\t2,000,000\t\t\t0.5\t\t\t0.25\t\t\t0.25\nOver\t2,500,000\t\t\t0.1\t\t\t0.10\t\t\t0.10\n\nNote that these are sliding (or graded) scales based on additional increments of premium volume, not on the total premium volume.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nUsing the regular scale previously shown, the first-year commission on a group case with an annual premium volume of $40,000 is calculated as follows:\n\n$1,000\tX\t20.0%\t$ 200\n4,000\tX\t20.0\t800\n5,000\tX\t15.0\t750\n10,000\tX\t12.5\t1,250\n10,000\tX\t10.0\t1,000\n10,000\tX\t5.0\t500\n \n$40,000\t\t\t$4,500  (or 11.25% of the total premium)\n\n\tAfter the first year, insurers may subdivide the commissions under either of these schedules into selling commissions and service commissions, with the agent who sold the case receiving the latter only if he or she continues to service the case.

In some cases, these TPAs are professionals who specialize solely in these tasks; in other cases, they are brokers, consultants, or insurance companies that market these services to their clients as additional products. Over the last decade, the use of TPAs has increased dramatically, particularly for medical expense benefits. KB-3 - Managing Employee Benefits - Should employers outsource benefit administration?\n\n\tIn general, yes. Benefit administration (especially around open enrollment time) can take a great deal of time and effort-time that could be better spent elsewhere. In today's market, employers should be able to find a capable benefits administrator for a reasonable price, which will allow them to spend their time concentrating on managing daily operations and growing their business. Plus, compliance mistakes can be costly and the best way to avoid them is to leave it to experts in employment law to make sure you stay in compliance with all the current benefit laws and regulations.\n\tPossible providers for administrative services include insurance companies, consulting firms, banks, payroll service companies, and investment brokers. In some cases though, the best option for setting and administering benefits may be a benefits broker.\n. The question is: What is a 'benefits broker'?. Ensure clarity in your explanation.",
            "response": "You are an expert on this topic. Answer the following question in detail, providing examples where applicable. Consider the context: KB-3 - Managing Employee Benefits - What is a \"benefits broker\"?\n\n\tA benefits broker is pretty much like any other insurance broker. They can help employers detc1mine what types of benefits work best for them and what plan options are available. In addition, benefit brokers can negotiate with plan providers to try to secure the lowest cost possible. A major advantage of working with benefit brokers is that there's no cost to the employer since brokers are paid in commissions from the plan providers based on the business the broker brings in. KB-5 - Employee Benefit Marketing - Sellers\n\n\tThe sellers of employee benefit products and services consist primarily of insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, PPOs, and third-party administrators. Just as there are certain generalizations about who makes employee benefit decisions within an organization, there are generalizations about where employers purchase products and services. However, the breakdown by size is different.\n\n\tEmployers with fewer than 10 employees, who have more limited choices than larger employers, often purchase coverage from multiple-employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs)-often structured as PPOs for medical expense coverage-or the Blues. However, there are significant geographic differences with respect to the purchase of medical expense coverage. In some geographic areas, the Blues, because of large discounts and community rating, have a significant cost advantage and are the primary providers of coverage. In other areas, the Blues are minor players and provide little coverage to such small employers. In still other areas, a very competitive marketplace exists. Depending on the geographic region, HMO coverage may or may not be readily available.\n\n\tThe choice of products and services increases for employers with 10 to 25 employees. Not only is coverage available from MEWAs and the Blues, but it can also frequently be obtained from HMOs and PPOs. For this size group, insurance companies also have products they sell directly to employers rather than through MEWAs.\n\n\tIf an employer has more than 50 employees, the possibility of self-funding of benefits, particularly medical expense benefits, becomes very real. In this marketplace, there is a significant demand for the purchase of administrative services from insurance companies and third-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to a variety of stop-to",

SIMPLE IRAs also don't allow for employee loans against the balance in their account and non-qualified withdrawals can result in a penalty of 10% of the withdrawal amount (25% if within the first 2 years of participation) plus the income tax owed.\n\n KB-3 - IRA Retirement Plans - What is a Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SARSEP IRA)?\n\n\tA Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan is a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a type oft a",

Consider the context: KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? \n\n\tA medical Flexible Spending Account (also known as a flexible spending arrangement or FSA) is a special account that an employee can put pre-tax money into to pay for certain out-of\u00adpocket health care costs not covered by insurance.

Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2060 - Flexible Spending Accounts - Sample Automatic Payment Request Form\n\n\tBelow is a sample form that can be used to request that amounts in a health care FSA are used to pay any deductibles or other required amounts.\n\n\t\t[Name of employer] individual spending account automatic payment request\n\n\tPlease use amounts credited to my Health Care Spending Account to pay any deductibles, coinsurance, or other qualifying expenses not covered by the [Name of Employer] Health Plan.\n\n\tI certify that I have paid, or will pay, the expenses for which Spending Account reimbursement is claimed and that they are not payable by any other plan. I further certify that I have not deducted, and will not deduct, these expenses on my individual income tax return.\n\n\tSIGNED:\n\n\tNOTE: If you will be sending your claim to a secondary payor, do not use this form at this time. After receiving payment from the secondary payor, attach all Explanation of Benefits and this form to a new claim form and re-submit to [Name of Insurer].\n KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2210 - How an FSA Works, Generally\n\tA flexible spending account (FSA) provides a method for an employee to pay for dependent care or medical and dental expenses with pre-tax dollars. (Reference 1 below)\n\tThrough payroll deductions (see KB-1 Topic 2265), an employee may contribute to one or more separate accounts before any withholding for federal income tax, FICA (Social Security tax), and, in most areas, state and local income tax.\n\tAs eligible expenses are incurred and claims are submitted, the employee is reimbursed from the proper account.\n\tHowever, if there are multiple accounts (for example, one for health care expenses and one for dependent care expenses), they are kept separate. An employee cannot be reimbursed for health care expenses out of the dependent care spending account, even if the health care spending account balance has been exhausted and the dependent care spending account has not been used during the year.\n\nFor more information ...\n\tSee KB-1 Topic 2285 for a discussion of withholding on FSAs.\n\nREFERENCE/S\n\n1 Prop. Reg. \u00a7 1.125-5.\n. The question is: How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? . Ensure clarity in your explanation.",

The credit is calculated as a percentage of premiums paid by the employer, and the percentage increases based on the number of employees and the average wages.\n\n                       The credit is available for two consecutive taxable years. To qualify for the credit, the employer must have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) and pay an average wage of less than $50,000 per year. The credit is calculated as follows:\n\n                       14% of premiums paid by the employer for taxable small businesses and tax-exempt organizations with 10 or fewer FTEs and an average wage of less than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2 than $2",

These arrangements can provide the small employers with greater bargaining power and potentially lower premiums. Trade associations often offer group health insurance plans to small businesses and their employees at reduced rates. Additionally, some states have laws aimed at helping small employers provide health insurance, and employers may be eligible for tax credits for their group health plan contributions under certain circumstances.",

The question is:  Can small employers who want to provide group health care join with other employers to help lower costs?. Ensure clarity in your explanation.\n\nSmall employers who want to provide group health care but cannot afford the high costs on their own have the option to join forces with other employers to form a group health insurance plan. This is often facilitated by trade associations, which offer health insurance plans to their members at lower rates due to the large number of employees they represent.\n\nFor instance, let's consider a small business with only 10 employees. The cost of providing a group health insurance plan for these employees might be prohibitively expensive for the employer. However, if this business joins a trade association with thousands of other members, the combined purchasing power of the group can lead to significant cost savings.\n\nMoreover, since the carrier issues a policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy to the policy",

For example, they might offer short-term disability insurance to all employees, but only offer long-term disability insurance to full-time employees. However, the employer must ensure that the disability insurance offered to all employees complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).\n\n                       Employers can also offer disability benefits on a voluntary basis, meaning that employees pay the premiums for the coverage. In this case, the employer may not be required to offer the same benefits to all employees, but they should still ensure that the benefits offered are non-discriminatory and comply with federal and state laws.\n\n                       Employers should also be aware that offering disability benefits to some employees but not others could potentially lead to claims of discrimination. For example, if an employer offers disability benefits only to employees in-employees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemployees who arelaborateamemploy",
