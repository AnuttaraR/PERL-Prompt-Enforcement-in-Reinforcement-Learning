In this case, employer-sponsored iras are an attractive alternative because the administration of these types of plans is relatively simple and straightforward.",

A 401k plan is overburdened if more than 60% of the plan balance is held by key employees, participants who meet one of three criteria: A company executive earning more than $185,000 annually An individual who owns 5% or more of the company An employee who owns more than 1% of the company and earns more than $150,000 annually 401k plans most likely to be overburdened include plans with little participation by nonkey employees, plans with a large number of low-wage participants, and plans owned by small business owners.

A VCP works similarly to self-correction in that the plan sponsor makes contributions to all non-key employees to bring the plan back into compliance. However, with a VCP, plan sponsors must also pay certain user fees that must be reported to the IRS. Typically, a VCP works best for larger companies or plans that have major violations. If the 401k plan is under audit, the IRS will work with the plan sponsor to develop an audit closure agreement specifying the corrective actions needed to bring the plan back into compliance.

        "ground_truth": "The most burdensome 401k plan tests at the beginning of each plan year measure the percentage of plan balances held by key employees and nonkey employees. 401k plan sponsors that fail the most burdensome tests must make contributions to nonkey employees to bring their plan into compliance by that year\u2019s tax filing deadline. A 4010k plan is overburdened if more than 60% of the plan balance is held by key employees, participants who meet one of three criteria: A company executive earning more than $185,000 annually An individual who owns 5% or more of the company An employee who owns more than 1% of the company and earns more than $150,000 annually 401k plans most likely to be overburdened include plans with little nonkey employee participation, plans with a large number of low-wage participants, and plans owned by small business owners. If the plan is overburdened, the employer must make contributions for all non-key employees equal to or greater than the highest employer contribution made to a key employee in the past year. Corrections must also be made by the last day of the plan year following the violation. There are three ways to correct an overburdened 401k plan, self-correction, voluntary correction, and an audit closeout agreement plan. As mentioned, if the violation is minor and certain criteria are met, the employer may be able to correct the plan by making employer contributions for non-key employees to bring the plan into compliance. A voluntary correction program (VCP) involves developing a specific correction plan with the IRS. While the VCP documents include a fee ranging from $1,500 to $3,500 depending on the assets in the plan, plan sponsors are more assured of maintaining the tax-qualified status of their 401k while correcting the overburdened violation. A VCP works similarly to self-correction in that the plan sponsor makes contributions to all non-key employees to bring the plan back into compliance. However, with a VCP, plan sponsors must also pay certain user fees that must be reported to the IRS. Typically, a VCP works best for larger companies or plans that have major violations. If the 401k plan is audited, the IRS will work with the plan sponsor to develop an audit closure agreement specifying the corrective actions needed to bring the plan back into compliance. Failure to comply with the correction plan could result in disqualification of the 401k plan.",
