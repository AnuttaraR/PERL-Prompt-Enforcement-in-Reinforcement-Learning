In this case, employer-sponsored iras are an attractive alternative because the administration of these types of plans is relatively simple and straightforward.",

A VCP works similarly to self-correction in that the plan sponsor makes contributions to all non-key employees to bring the plan back into compliance. However, with a VCP, plan sponsors must also pay certain user fees that must be reported to the IRS. Typically, a VCP works best for larger companies or plans that have major violations. If the 401k plan is under audit, the IRS will work with the plan sponsor to develop an audit closure agreement specifying the corrective actions needed to bring the plan back into compliance.

        "ground_truth": "The most burdensome 401k plan tests at the beginning of each plan year measure the percentage of plan balances held by key employees and nonkey employees. 401k plan sponsors that fail the most burdensome tests must make contributions to nonkey employees to bring their plan into compliance by that year\u2019s tax filing deadline. A 4010k plan is overburdened if more than 60% of the plan balance is held by key employees, participants who meet one of three criteria: A company executive earning more than $185,000 annually An individual who owns 5% or more of the company An employee who owns more than 1% of the company and earns more than $150,000 annually 401k plans most likely to be overburdened include plans with little nonkey employee participation, plans with a large number of low-wage participants, and plans owned by small business owners. If the plan is overburdened, the employer must make contributions for all non-key employees equal to or greater than the highest employer contribution made to a key employee in the past year. Corrections must also be made by the last day of the plan year following the violation. There are three ways to correct an overburdened 401k plan, self-correction, voluntary correction, and an audit closeout agreement plan. As mentioned, if the violation is minor and certain criteria are met, the employer may be able to correct the plan by making employer contributions for non-key employees to bring the plan into compliance. A voluntary correction program (VCP) involves developing a specific correction plan with the IRS. While the VCP documents include a fee ranging from $1,500 to $3,500 depending on the assets in the plan, plan sponsors are more assured of maintaining the tax-qualified status of their 401k while correcting the overburdened violation. A VCP works similarly to self-correction in that the plan sponsor makes contributions to all non-key employees to bring the plan back into compliance. However, with a VCP, plan sponsors must also pay certain user fees that must be reported to the IRS. Typically, a VCP works best for larger companies or plans that have major violations. If the 401k plan is audited, the IRS will work with the plan sponsor to develop an audit closure agreement specifying the corrective actions needed to bring the plan back into compliance. Failure to comply with the correction plan could result in disqualification of the 401k plan.",

        "ground_truth": "A flexible medical spending account, also known as a flexible spending arrangement or fsa, is a special account into which an employee can contribute pre-tax money to pay for certain health care expenses not covered by insurance. Employers can also make contributions to the fsa, but are not required to do so. Facts to keep in mind about the fsa include that the fsa can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group health care plan. There are two different types of fsa that an employer can offer. Health fsa's allow employees to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent care fsa's allow employees to pay for expenses with tax-free dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees. Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses such as daycare, prescriptions, dental care and eye exams. Employees are reimbursed for their expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means that the bills must be paid out of pocket and the employee must file a claim to be reimbursed by the FSA. Contributions made to a flexible spending account must be spent in the current plan year or forfeited, although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they choose. Employees with a flexible spending account have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year, even if some or all of that amount has not yet been deposited. Only full-time employees are eligible to participate in a flexible spending account. Part-time employees, those who work fewer than 30 hours per week, are not eligible for a flexible spending account. Typically, employees cannot change the amount they contribute per pay period once they have decided to do so, but exceptions can be made for events such as the birth of a child or the death of a spouse. Employees have the option of using a debit card, also called a flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their flexible spending account. Using a flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place. Employees under age 65 who spend money in their FSA for non-medical expenses must pay income tax on that money plus a penalty of typically 20 percent of the amount spent. Employees age 65 or older must pay income tax on non-medical expense amounts but are not penalized. There are dozens of items that are considered medical expenses under an FSA. The employer owns the FSA, so departing employees are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA unless they elect continuation coverage and lose any remaining funds in their account. Employers can choose to let participants roll over some of their FSA money to the new plan year using one of two options: Setting a maximum limit of $500 and allowing participants to roll over that portion of their unspent funds to the new plan year. Choosing to allow a 2-month grace period after the end of the plan year for participants to claim any remaining funds in their account. When the grace period ends, the remaining funds become the property of the employer. Note that IRS Publication 502 contains a list of medical items that are and are not covered by an FSA.",

        "ground_truth": "A flexible medical spending account, also known as a flexible spending arrangement or fsa, is a special account into which an employee can contribute pre-tax money to pay for certain wellness care expenses not covered by insurance. Employers can also make contributions to the fsa, but are not required to do so. Facts to keep in mind about the fsa include that the fsa can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group health care plan. There are two different types of fsa that an employer can offer. Health fsa's allow employees to pay for their out-of-pocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent care fsa's allow employees to pay for their expenses with tax-free dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees. Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses such as daycare, prescriptions, dental care and eye exams. Employees are reimbursed for their expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means that the bills must be paid out of pocket and the employee must deposit a security to be reimbursed by the FSA. Contributions made to a flexible spending account must be spent in the current plan year or forfeited, although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they choose. Employees with a flexible spending account have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year, even if some or all of that amount has not yet been deposited. Only full-time employees are eligible to participate in a flexible spending account. Part-time employees, those who work fewer than 30 hours per week, are not eligible for a flexible spending account. Typically, employees cannot change the amount they contribute per pay period once they have decided to do so, but exceptions can be made for events such as the birth of a child or the death of a spouse. Employees have the option of using a debit card, also called a flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their flexible spending account. Using a flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place. Employees under age 65 who spend money in their FSA for non-medical expenses must pay income tax on that money plus a penalty of typically 20 percent of the amount spent. Employees age 65 or older must pay income tax on non-medical expense amounts but are not penalized. There are dozens of items that are considered medical expenses under an FSA. The employer owns the FSA, so departing employees are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA unless they elect continuation coverage and lose any remaining funds in their account. Employers can choose to let participants roll over some of their FSA money to the new plan year using one of two options: Setting a maximum limit of $500 and allowing participants to roll over that portion of their unspent funds to the new plan year. Choosing to allow a 2-month grace period after the end of the plan year for participants to claim any remaining funds in their account. When the grace period ends, the remaining funds become the property of the employer. Note that IRS Publication 502 contains a list of medical items that are and are not covered by an FSA.",
