The employer allocates a certain number of shares of the company to each eligible employee, with the number of shares based on the person's pay or some similar scale. Each employee's shares are held in the company's ESOP trust until the employee leaves or retires. At that point, employees can either sell their shares on the stock market or sell them back to the company. Employees aren't taxed until they sell their shares and, in certain cases, taxes can be deferred even longer if the money from the sale of stock is reinvested in the stocks of other companies. Typically, employees aren't eligible to participate in the plan until they have worked a certain length of time for the company. Also, employees generally have to be vested before they have access to their shares (that is, they need to have waited some period of \ntime defined in the plan before they get ownership of the stock).\n"

Because several different payments contribute to TrOOP, CMS awarded a contract to NDC Health to provide coordination-of-benefits systems. NDC Health is responsible for systems that will monitor TrOOP on a pharmacy level so that beneficiaries can question their pharmacists about how close they are to catastrophic coverage. To ensure accuracy of this information, NDC Health is required to route claims for benefits paid by entities other than Medicare to the prescription drug plans. This requirement ensures that what seniors pay at pharmacies takes into account the appropriate level of their Medicare coverage.\n\n\nTABLE\t21-1\nMedicare Part D Standard Benefit Design Parameters\n\n\t\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\t2011\nAfter the deductible is met, the beneficiary pays 25% of covered costs up to total prescription costs meeting the initial coverage limit\tDeductible\t$265\t$275\t$295\t$310\t$310\nCoverage gap (donut hole) begins at this point\tInitial coverage limit\t$2,400\t$2,510\t$2,700\t$2,830\t$2,840\nIncluding the coverage gap, catastrophic coverage starts after this point\tTotal covered Part D drug out-of-pocket spending\t$5,451.25\t$5,726.25\t$6,153.75\t$6,440.00\nplus a\n$250\nbrand rebate\t$6,447.50\nplus a 50%\nbrand\ndiscount\nTrue out-of- pocket costs including\nthe donut hole (deductible+ initial coverage+ coverage gap = true out-of- pocket (TrOOP) cost)\tTrue\nout-of-pocket threshold\t$265.00\n$533.75\nSi3,051.25\t$275.00\n$558.75\nSi3,216.25\t$295.00\n$601.25\nSi3,453.75\t$310.00\n$630.00\nSi3,610.00\t$310.00\n$632.50\nSi3,607.50\n\t\t$3,850.00\t$4,050.00\t$4,350.00\t$4,550.00\t$4,550.00\n\tCatastrophic Coverage Benefit\n\tGeneric/ preferred multisource drug\t$2.15\t$2.25\t$2.40\t$2.50\t$2.50*\n\tOther drugs\t$5.35\t$5.60\t$6.00\t$6.30\t$6.30*\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Coverage is either the greater of 5%, or the values in the table above.

In return, the insurance company agrees to pay specific benefit amounts for such events as death, medical care expenses, or disability. The employer's annual premium is based on historic claims cost experience of employers of similar size and characteristics and the underwriting factors and administrative expenses of the insurance company.\n\n\tThe insurance company uses the premiums paid by all employers to pay the claims incurred under its group insurance plans. Employers whose actual claims costs are less than their premium payments subsidize employers whose claims costs exceed their premium payments. In a conventional insurance arrangement, there is no reconciliation of an employer's premium payments to its actual plan expenses. Instead, any adjustment of premium charges reflects the loss experience of all employers.\n\nPremium Cost Factors\n\n\tThe insurance company considers a number of factors in determining the total cost of insuring a risk.\n\nPaid Claims\n\n\tThis is the total benefits paid to insured employees or their dependents during the policy period.\n\nReserves\n\n\tThis cost reflects the insurance company's liability to pay benefits in the future for a loss incurred during the policy year. The most common reserve is the incurred but unreported claim reserve established to pay losses incurred during the policy year but not reported for payment until after the policy year has ended. Reserves are also established for deferred benefit payment liabilities such as reserves for the life insurance waiver of premium, retiree life insurance, and future disability benefit payments.\n\nOther Claim Charges\n\n\tSeveral additional costs are assumed by the insurance company for providing special benefit coverages such as extended liability coverage and conversion to an individual insurance policy when a participant terminates employment.\n\nAdministrative Charges\n\n\tAlthough the terminology and allocation of administrative expenses vary by insurance company, there are six main cost categories:\n\n\t1. Commissions. This is the payment to a licensed insurance agent or broker for helping the employer obtain the insurance coverage and administer the plan. The commission amount is normally determined as a percentage of the premium paid, with the percentage either remaining level or declining as the premium increases.\n\n\t2. Premium taxes. A state tax is levied on the premiums received by insurance companies in the resident states of insured employees. This tax expense is passed directly to the employer, normally as a percentage of premium paid. The current tax rate averages about 2 percent of premium, but varies from state to state.\n\n\t3. Risk charge. Each insured employer contributes to the insurance company's contingency reserve for unexpected, catastrophic claims. The risk charge is normally determined by a formula based on the premium amount.\n\n\t4. Claims administration expenses. These are the expenses incurred by the insurance company to investigate claims and calculate and pay the appropriate benefits. These expenses are normally fixed per claim, with the per-claim cost varying by the type of benefits paid. For example, life insurance benefits are relatively simple and quick to administer and have a low administrative cost per claim compared with disability and medical claims, which often require medical review and more difficult benefit calculations.\n\n\t5. Other administrative expenses. Charges for actuarial, legal, accounting, and other such services plus overhead expenses are shared by all contract holders. These expenses are determined as a percentage of the premium amount, as a fixed charge, or as a variable charge based on the insurance company's actual services provided to the employer.\n\n\t6. Insurance company profit (stock company) or contribution to surplus (mutual company).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 Topic 1965 - Life Insurance - Other Types of Life Insurance: \"Split-Dollar\" Life Insurance\n\n\tUnder a \"split-dollar\" insurance plan, the employer and employee join in purchasing an insurance contract on the employee's life in which there is a substantial investment element.(Reference 1 below) The employer pays that part of the annual premium that represents the increase in the cash surrender value each year, and the employee pays the balance of the annual premium.\n\tThe employer is entitled to receive, out of the proceeds of the policy, an amount equal to the cash surrender value, or at least a sufficient part of the cash surrender value to equal the funds it has provided for premium payments. The employee's beneficiary (as named by the employee) is entitled to the rest of the proceeds.\n\t\n\tPointer: The practical effect of a split-dollar arrangement is that, although the employee must pay a substantial part of the first premium, after the first year his or her share of the premium decreases rapidly, and the employee obtains valuable insurance protection with a relatively small outlay for premiums in the early years and at little or no cost in later years.\n\nTaxation of employee\n\tThe IRS has issued final regulations providing comprehensive rules for split\u00addollar life insurance arrangements. The regulations generally define a split-dollar life insurance arrangement as any arrangement between an owner of a life insurance contract and a nonowner of the contract under which either party to the arrangement pays all or part of the premiums, and one of the parties paying the premiums is entitled to re< over (either conditionally or unconditionally) all or any portion of those premiums and such recovery is to be made from, or is secured by, the proceeds of the contract.\n\nTwo mutually exclusive regimes. The regulations also provide two mutually exclusive regimes for taxing split-dollar life insurance arrangements: an economic benefit regime and a loan regime. Ownership of the life insurance contract determines which regime applies. If the executive is the owner, the employer's premium payments are treated as loans to the executive. If the employer is the owner, the employer's premium payments are treated as providing taxable economic benefits to the executive. Such benefits include the executive's interest in the policy cash value and current life insurance protection.(Reference 2 below)\n\nGuidance issued on treatment of employer-owned contracts\n\tThe IRS has issued guidance concerning the treatment of employer-owned life insurance contracts. The guidance, issued in question-and-answer format, ad\u00ad dresses the definition of the term \"employer-owned life insurance contract\"; satisfaction of the notice and consent requirements; a transition rule for life insurance contracts pursuant to a Code Sec. 1035 exchange; and information reporting.\n\nPremiums not deductible\n\tNeither the employer nor the employee is entitled to deduct premiums paid under a split-dollar plan. A deduction is denied to the employer if it is a direct or indirect beneficiary under the policy.(Reference 3 below)The employee's deduction is denied because the payment is a personal expense.\n\nFor more information ...\n\tExamples illustrating split-dollar life insurance protection are located at ,KB-1 Topic 34,060 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1 IRS Reg. \u00a71.101-1. \n2 IRS Reg. \u00a71.61-22.\n3 Code Sec. 264(a) (1).\n"

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-4 - Chapter 1 - Introduction - 1.04 History and Purposes of ERISA (Reference 9 below)\n\n                 ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (Reference 10 below) was signed into law by President Gerald Ford on September 2, 1974 (Reference 11 below) It was the culmination ofmore than a decade of Congressional hearings, reports, studies, and deliberations on the weaknesses and problems with existing state and federal regulation of employee benefit plans. (Reference 12 below)\n\n\n[A] Pre-ERISA Regulation of Employee Benefit Plans\n\nPrior to the enactment of ERISA, employee benefit plans were impacted by three types of federal laws:\n(1) federal income tax laws,\n(2) federal labor laws, and\n(3) the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act. (Reference 13 below)\n\nIn addition, employee benefit plans were subject to some state law regulation.\nNevertheless, substantive regulation of employee benefit plans was relatively limited.\n\n\n[1] Federal Income Tax Law\n             Federal income tax law encouraged the creation of \u201cqualified\u201d pension plans by providing for favorable income tax treatment of such plans. (Reference 14 below) Tax law, however, did not impose much substantive regulation on qualified plans. For example, it did not require advance fimding ofbenefits nor did it require that benefits become vested, that is, non\u0002forfeitable, after a certain period oftime. Federal tax law was most concerned with targeting the tax subsidy and ensuring that lower-income employees as well as higher-income employees participated in and benefited from qualified pension plans.\n\n\n[2] Federal Labor Law\n             The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), (Reference 15 below) enacted in 1935, established a frame\u0002work for the bargaining of pension and welfare benefits. (Reference 16 below) In 1947, the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) (Reference 17 below) amended the NLRA to require that pension and welfare benefit plans subject to the Act be administered by joint trustee fiduciaries representing both employees and employers. (Reference 18 below) The LMRA also required that plans subject to the Act be written and operated for the \u201cexclusive benefit\u201d of the employees. (Reference 19 below) Case law established principles of fiduciary responsibility governing plan administration and the investment of plan assets. (Reference 20 below) Federal labor law, however, only regulated plans established pursuant to collective bargaining agreements (Reference 21 below) and was not enforced uniformly. (Reference 22 below) For example, the Department ofJustice only enforced the labor law pro\u0002visions when there was evidence of criminality, and participants and beneficiaries were often reluctant to enforce the law because of the fear of retaliation. (Reference 23 below)\n\n\n[3] Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act\n             In 1958, Congress enacted the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act (WPPDA), (Reference 24 below) the first federal statute aimed directly and exclusively at private employee benefit plans. The WPPDA did not impose any substantive regulations on employee benefit plans. Instead, it sought to regulate employee benefit plans through reporting and disclosure requirements. (Reference 25 below) The theory behind the WPPDA was that \u201cfull disclosure to plan participants and beneficiaries ofthe provisions oftheir plan and its financial operations would deter abuse (\u2018sunlight being the best disinfectant\u2019) and would enable [participants and beneficiaries] to police the plans themselves without requiring greater Government regulations or interference.\u201d (Reference 26 below) The WPPDA expressly preserved state authority to regulate employee benefit plans. (Reference 27 below)\n\n\n[4] State Law\n             When Congress enacted the WPPDA, six states had already enacted statutes specifically directed at employee benefit plans. (Reference 28 below) For the most part, however, employee benefit plans were regulated by state common law prior to the enactment of ERISA, and little of that common law was directed specifically at employee benefit plans. (Reference 29 below)\n\n\n[B] Failure of Pre-ERISA Law to Protect Plan Participants and Beneficiaries\n              By the 1960s, a consensus was beginning to form that state and federal law did not provide sufficient protection to employee benefit plan participants and beneficiaries. (Reference 30 below) \n\n              The failure of pre-ERISA law to protect plan participants and beneficiaries was  most famously\u2014and starkly\u2014illustrated by the closing ofthe Studebaker automobile plant in December 1963. (Reference 31 below) Prior to the enactment of ERISA, neither federal nor state law required that pension plans be prefunded, that is, the law did not require that contributions be made during each employee\u2019s working life to ensure that the full cost ofthe benefit promised to the employee was funded when the employee retired. (Reference 32 below) Thus, when the Studebaker plant closed, and its pension plan terminated, the Studebaker\u2019s plan\u2019s liabilities (that is, its promised benefits) exceeded its assets by $15 million. (Reference 33 below)  As a result, the terminated plan was unable to pay all of the plan participants all ofthe benefits that they had been promised. Specifically, 4,000 vested employees between the ages of 40 and 60 received 15% of their promised benefits while 2,900  workers under the age of 40 received no benefits whatsoever (regardless of whether their benefits were vested). (Reference 34 below) \n\n              The Studebaker plant closing clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the law to ensure proper plan funding. Inadequate funding, however, was not the only risk that plan participants faced. Prior to the enactment of ERISA, some pension plans did not provide for the vesting of benefits. (Reference 35 below)  Employers ofsuch plans were free to terminate their plans at any time, and employees had no enforceable rights to their promised pensions. Moreover, plans that did provide for the vesting of benefits could impose age limits and lengthy service requirements. According to one account, prior to ERISA, fewer than 10% of plan participants ever attained benefit eligibility because of lengthy service requirements and numerous disqualification provisions. (Reference 36 below) \n\n              In addition to concerns about inadequate funding and vesting of pension plans, \u201cCongress was also concerned that large amounts of money in the hands of plan managers created a temptation for self-dealing and improper handling of these funds.\u201d (Reference 37 below)  In the 1950s, a special Senate committee was established to investigate improper practices with respect to employee benefit plans. The investigations uncovered \u201call manner of abuses, ranging from ineptness and lack of know-how to outright looting of benefit funds and corrupt administration.\u201d (Reference 38 below) For example, in 1965, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations discovered that George Barasch, the founder of two New Jersey unions, had managed to manipulate and divert the\nfunds ofthe unions\u2019 employee benefit plans so as to make himself a prospective multimillionaire (Reference 39 below)  He was both trustee of the plans and owner of a benefit consulting firm which operated the plans and collected huge consulting fees on his behalf. (Reference 37 below)  Existing law did not adequately protect against this behavior. (Reference 41 below) \n\n\n[C] Purposes of ERISA\n              In section 2 of ERISA, (Reference 42 below) Congress set forth, at length, its findings and declaration of policy in enacting ERISA.\n\n              Congress identified four principal problems with employee benefit plans: (1) in\u0002adequate disclosure of plan information, (2) inadequate safeguards against inappropriate plan administration, (Reference 43 below) (3) the widespread loss of anticipated retirement benefits due to the lack of vesting provisions, and (4) the inability of plans to provide promised benefits due to inadequate funding. (Reference 44 below)\n\n              Congress then identified six ways in which ERISA would address those problems: (1) by imposing reporting and disclosure requirements, (2) by establishing fiduciary standards, (3) by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to courts, (4) by imposing vesting standards, (5) by imposing minimum funding standards, and (6) by requiring plan termination insurance. (Reference 45 below)\n\n               On a number of occasions, the Supreme Court has referred to Congress\u2019 purposes in enacting ERISA. For example, in one early case, Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., (Reference 46 below) the Court declared, \u201cone of Congress\u2019 central purposes in enacting [ERISA] was to prevent the \u2018great personal tragedy\u2019 suffered by employees whose vested benefits are not paid when pension plans are terminated.\u201d (Reference 47 below) In Boggs v. Boggs, (Reference 48 below) the Court announced that \u201c[t]he principal object ofthe statute is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries.\u201d (Reference 49 below)\n\n               Not all of ERISA\u2019s provisions, however, protect and favor plan participants. For example, ERISA expressly preempts state laws that relate to employee benefit plans. To the extent that state law provides employees with greater protections than does\nERISA, ERISA preemption does not protect or favor plan participants. Instead, ERISA preemption favors plan sponsors and administrators by promoting uniformity oflaw and reducing the administrative burden of complying with multiple laws. ERISA\u2019s legislative history makes clear that not only did Congress intend to protect plan participants in enacting ERISA, but it also sought to encourage employers to voluntarily establish employee benefit plans and thus tried not to place undue burdens on plans\nwhen enacting ERISA. (Reference 50 below)\n\n               Accordingly, ERISA may be said to have conflicting purposes. (Reference 51 below) Indeed, in Varity Corp. V. Howe, (Reference 52 below) the Court noted that in interpreting ERISA, \u201ccourts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes, such as Congress\u2019 desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits, on the one hand, and, on the other, its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs, or litigation expenses, unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place. (Reference 53 below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n9. For an extensive history of ERISA, see James A. Wooten, The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974: A Political History (2004).\n10. Pub. L.

Pub. L. No. 69-20, 44 Stat. 9; 1928 Revenue Act \u00a73165, Pub. L. No. 70-562, 45 Stat. 791. The Revenue Act of 1938 conditioned favorable income tax treatment on the requirement that the trust be \u201cirrevocable\u201d and for the exclusive benefit of employees. 1938 Revenue Act \u00a723(p)(3). Pub. L. No. 75-554, 52 Stat. 447, 463-464. The 1942 Act tightened the rules governing favorable in\u0002come tax treatment by requiring that plans not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees and imposing limits on tax deductions for contributions to fund pension plans. 1942 Revenue Act \u00a7 162, Pub. L. No. 753, 56 Stat. 798, 862. While the tax rules governing pension plans have evolved considerably over the years, these basic elements have not changed.\n15. Pub. L.

If an employee dies, becomes incapacitated, loses his or her job or suffers a reduction in work hours, health care coverage can be extended for up to 18 or 36 months, depending on circumstances. \n\n                       The cost of health insurance provided under COBRA is usually high, because the recipient pays the entire premium including the portion that was being paid by the employer. In that sense, COBRA coverage is primarily a stop-gap until less expensive health insurance can be found.\n\n                       To qualify for COBRA coverage, an employee has to have been enrolled in a company-sponsored group health insurance plan on the day before the qualifying event (loss of job, reduced hours, etc.) occurs and the insurance plan must have been in effect on more than 50% of the employer's typical business days during the previous calendar year. ln addition, the employer must still be offering existing employees a group health plan; if the employer stops offering health coverage or goes out of business or drops below 20 employees the employee seeking COBRA coverage may no longer be eligible for extended insurance benefits.\n\n                       Even small employers with less than 20 employees may be required to provide extended insurance coverage to employees who have suffered a qualifying event. Many states have laws similar to COBRA. These \"mini-COBRA\" laws generally apply to employers of all sizes, including those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1400 - Continuation Coverage COBRA - The Basics of COBRA\n \n\tUnder federal law, group health plans are required to offer continuation of group health coverage to certain former employees and their families upon the occurrence of certain \"qualifying events.\" This requirement is generally called COBRA because it was first enacted as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.(Reference 1 below)\n\n\tPointer: FAST FACTS about COBRA\n\t\tCOBRA requires employers offering group health plans to offer continuation health coverage to certain former employees and their families upon the occur\u00ad rence of job loss or other qualifying events.\n\t\tCOBRA coverage may last 18, 29 or 36 months, depending on the type of qualifying event that triggered the COBRA coverage. Employers are not required to bear the cost of continuation coverage. The group health plan may require the covered employee to pay a premium for continuation coverage. The premium cannot be more than 102 percent of the cost of the plan for similarly situated beneficiaries who have not experienced a qualifying event.\n\nCovered health plans\n\n\tCOBRA applies to all group health plans except:\n\t\t\u25a1 plans maintained by small employers (i.e., those with fewer than 20 employees);\n\t\t\u25a1 plans maintained for governmental employees; and\n\t\t\u25a1 plans established by churches.\n\nGroup health plans\n\tIn general, a group health plan is an employer-maintained plan that provides health care to the employer's employees, former employees, or the families of such employees or former employees. This is true whether the coverage is provided directly or through insurance, reimbursement or otherwise.\n\nQualified beneficiaries\n\tAn employee covered under an employer's group health plan is a qualified beneficiary only in situations where the qualifying event is a termination (other than for gross misconduct) or a reduction in working hours.\n\tAlso, an individual is a qualified beneficiary if, on the day before a qualifying event, that person is covered under the employer's plan and is the spouse, a dependent child of the covered employee, or a child born, adopted by or placed for adoption with the covered employee during the period of COBRA coverage.\n\tRetirees, independent contractors, directors of a corporation, and partners of a partnership are considered \"covered employees\" if they are covered under the group health plan on the day before a qualifying event.\n\nQualifying events\n\tQualified beneficiaries who lose coverage under a group health plan as the result of a qualifying event are entitled to elect continuation coverage. Qualifying events are certain types of events that would cause the qualified beneficiary to lose health coverage.\n\n\tThe following can be qualifying events:\n\t\t\u25a1 voluntary or involuntary termination of employment for any reason other than gross misconduct;\n\t\t\u25a1 reduction in the number of hours of employment;\n\t\t\u25a1 death of the covered employee;\n\t\t\u25a1 divorce or legal separation of the covered employee from the employee's spouse;\n\t\t\u25a1 entitlement to Medicare for the covered employee;\n\t\t\u25a1 loss of dependent child status under the plan rules; and\n\t\t\u25a1 bankruptcy proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code with respect to an employer from whose employment a covered employee retired at any time.\n\nLoss of coverage\n\tRemember, any of the above events is a qualifying event only if it results in a loss of coverage to the qualified beneficiary. To lose coverage means to cease to be covered under the same terms and conditions in effect immediately before the qualifying event. This includes the premium amount paid for the coverage. Thus, an increase in an employee paid premium or contribution for coverage that results from a qualifying event is considered a loss of coverage.\n\nNotice\n\tCOBRA prescribes notification responsibilities that apply to employers, plan administrators, and, in certain instances, covered employees and qualified beneficiaries. (In many cases, the employer and plan administrator will be the same person or entity.)\n\tInitial notice. When an employee becomes covered under a group health plan, the plan must furnish to the employee and the employee's spouse initial written notice of their rights under COBRA\n\tElection notice. The second round of notice-giving is triggered when a qualifying event occurs. Employers must notify plan administrators within 30 days of a covered employee's death, termination, reduction in hours of employment, entitlement to Medicare or initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by an employer. Plan administrators must provide a notice of the right to elect continuation coverage to each qualified beneficiary within 14 days of receiving notice that a qualifying event occurred. A plan administrator may satisfy this responsibility by sending the notice by first-class mail to the last known address of the beneficiary. Often this can be sent simultaneously with certifications of creditable coverage required by HIPAA\n\tEmployee's notice duties. The covered employee or qualified beneficiary must notify the plan administrator within 60 days of a divorce or legal separation or the date on which a child ceases to be a dependent under plan rules.\n\nElections\n\tThe beneficiary, or a representative of the beneficiary, must elect COBRA coverage within 60 days of the later of (1) the date coverage is lost, or (2) the date that notice to the qualified beneficiary is sent.\n\tAn election by a qualified beneficiary is considered made on the date that it is sent.\n \nScope of COBRA coverage\n\tContinuation coverage must be identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries. This usually means the same coverage that the qualified beneficiary had on the day before the qualifying event. COBRA beneficiaries may change coverage during periods of open enrollment offered by the plan in the same way that employees may change coverage.\n\nDuration of coverage\n\tCOBRA generally provides a maximum continuation period of 18 months. If a qualified beneficiary becomes disabled within 60 days of COBRA coverage, the period can be extended to 29 months. Also, if certain qualifying events occur during the original 18 months of COBRA coverage, qualified beneficiaries become entitled to receive 36 months of continuation coverage. A qualified beneficiary's maximum continuation period begins on the date of the qualifying event, and in no case can the maximum period exceed 36 months.\n\nPaying for COBRA\n\tEmployers may require qualified beneficiaries to pay the entire premium for coverage, plus a 2% administrative charge, for a total of 102% of the cost of coverage to the plan for similarly situated individuals still covered under the plan.\n\tFor disabled qualified beneficiaries receiving either 29 months of coverage or 36 months of coverage due to a secondary qualifying event that occurs during the disability extension period, premiums may be increased after 18 months to 150% of the plan's total cost of coverage. If the disabled individual is part of the same coverage group as family members who are not disabled qualified beneficiaries, the family members may also be charged 150% after 18 months.\n\nMergers and acquisitions\n\tIRS regulations provide guidance on determining COBRA liabilities of buyers and sellers of corporate stock and corporate assets and permit buyers and sellers to reallocate and carry out those liabilities by agreement. (See ,KB-1 Topic 1502 for more on COBRA obligations in a business reorganization).\n\nState law treatment\n\tOver 35 states have enacted so-called mini-COBRA laws. These state laws often require small employers to offer continuation coverage. Some state laws require all employers to offer continuation coverage that is more generous than what is required by federal law.\n\tPointer: Impact of health reform on COBRA rights. The Affordable Care Act did not change employees' rights to continuation coverage under COBRA, or employers' responsibilities to provide general and election notices to eligible employees. However, with the opening of enrollment via the exchanges in October 2013, workers who have lost employer-provided coverage now have additional options for coverage. Options available on the exchanges may be less expensive than COBRA coverage, especially for workers eligible for premium tax credits. As a result, some speculate that COBRA participation rates, never very high, will grow smaller in the coming years. In addition, note that COBRA coverage is \"minimum essential coverage\" for purposes of the ACA shared responsibility rules and other provisions.\n\nFor more information ...\n\tA quick reference to frequently asked questions and answers about COBRA is located at ,KB-1 Topic 14,140 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n\tCOBRA GUIDE is a complete source for COBRA-related information.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1 Continuation coverage requirements for group health plans enacted by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L.99-272) are located at Code Sec. 4980B; IRS Reg.\u00a7 \u00a7 54.4980B-54.4980B-10; ERISA Secs. 601- 608.\n"

In some plans, coverage ceases on the last day of the month in which employment terminates.\n\t\t\u2022 the date on which the employee ceases to be eligible the date on which the master contract terminates\n\t\t\u2022 the date on which the overall maximum benefit of major medical coverage is received\n\t\t\u2022 the end of the last period for which the employee makes any required contribution\n\n\tCoverage on any dependent usually ceases on the earliest of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 the date on which he or she ceases to meet the definition of dependent\n\t\t\u2022 the date on which the coverage of the employee ceases for any reason except the employee's receipt of the overall maximum benefit\n\t\t\u2022 the date on which the dependent receives the overall maximum benefit of major medical coverage\n\t\t\u2022 the end of the last period for which the employee makes any required contribution for dependent coverage\n\n\tHowever, coverage often continues past these dates because of federal legislation or employer practices.\n\nContinuation of Coverage under COBRA\n\nCOBRA\n\n\tThe Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) requires that group health plans allow employees and certain beneficiaries to elect to have their current health insurance coverage extended at group rates for up to 36 months following a \"qualifying event\" that results in the loss of coverage for a \"qualified beneficiary.\" The term group health plan as used in the act is broad enough to include medical expense plans, dental plans, vision care plans, and prescription drug plans, regardless of whether benefits are self-insured or provided through other entities, such as insurance companies, HMOs, or PPOs. Long-term care and disability income coverages are not included in the definition of group health plan and are not subject to COBRA.\n\n\tCOBRA also applies to voluntary group health plans even if the employee pays the entire premium as long as an employee would not be able to receive the coverage at the same cost if the employment relationship ended. If the voluntary plan has a portability provision whereby an employee can continue the coverage on an individual basis at no increase in cost, then COBRA does not apply.\n\n\tCertain church-related plans and plans of the federal government are exempt from COBRA, but the act applies to all other employers who had the equivalent of 20 or more full-time employees on at least 50 percent of its typical business days during the preceding calendar year. For example, an employer who has 10 full-time and 16 half-time employees throughout the year has the equivalent of 18 full-time employees and is not subject to COBRA.\n\n\tFailure to comply with the act results in an excise tax of up to $100 per day for each person denied coverage. The IRS can levy the tax on the employer as well as on the entity (such as an insurer or HMO) that provides or administers the benefits. In addition, employers face a significant liability risk if they fail to notify qualified beneficiaries about the availability of COBRA coverage. There have been legal judgments under which employers have been required to pay uninsured claims that would have been covered if a qualified beneficiary had known about COBRA and elected coverage.\n\nQualified Beneficiary\n\n\tCOBRA defines a qualified beneficiary as any employee, or the spouse or dependent child of the employee, who on the day before a qualifying event had coverage under the employee's group health plan. HIPAA expanded the definition to include any child who is born to or placed for adoption with the employee during the period of COBRA coverage. This change gives automatic eligibility for COBRA coverage to the child as well as the right to have his or her own election rights if a second qualifying event occurs.\n\nQualifying Event\n\n\tUnder the act, each of the following is a qualifying event if it results in the loss of coverage by a qualifled beneficiary or an increase in the amount the qualified beneficiary must pay for the coverage:\n\n\t\t\u2022 the death of the covered employee\n\t\t\u2022 the termination of the employee for any reason except gross misconduct. This includes quitting, retiring, or being fired for anything other than gross misconduct.\n\t\t\u2022 a reduction of the employee's hours so that the employee or dependent is ineligible for coverage\n\t\t\u2022 the divorce or legal separation of the employee and his or her spouse\n\t\t\u2022 for spouses and children, the employee's eligibility for Medicare \n\t\t\u2022 a child's ceasing to be an eligible dependent under the plan\n\n\tThe act specifies that a qualified beneficiary is entitled to elect continued coverage without providing evidence of insurability. The plan must allow the beneficiary to continue coverage identical to that available to employees and dependents to whom a qualifying event has not occurred. Persons electing COBRA continuation can change their coverage when changes are made to the plan covering similarly situated active employees and their dependents. In addition, a qualified beneficiary who moves out of an area served by a region-specific plan must have the right to change coverage if the employer is able to provide coverage under another of its existing plans.\n\n\tThe plan must allow each qualified beneficiary to continue coverage from the qualifying event until the earliest of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 18 months for employees and dependents when the employee's employment ceases or coverage terminates because of a reduction in hours. This period extends to 29 months for a qualified beneficiary if the Social Security Administration determines that the beneficiary was or became totally disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA coverage.\n\n\t\t\u2022 36 months for other qualifying events\n\n\t\t\u2022 the date the plan terminates for all employees\n\n\t\t\u2022 the date the coverage ceases because of a failure to make a timely payment of premium for the qualified beneficiary's coverage. COBRA regulations prohibit a plan from discontinuing coverage because a payment is short by an insignificant amount, which the regulations define as the lesser of $50 or 10 percent of the amount due. The plan must either (1) accept the amount received as satisfying the plan's payment requirement or (2) notify the\nbeneficiary of the amount of the deficiency and grant a reasonable time for it to be paid.\n\n\t\t\u2022 the date the qualified beneficiary subsequently becomes entitled to Medicare or becomes covered (as either an employee or dependent) under another group health plan, provided the group health plan does not contain an exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition. If the new plan does not cover a preexisting condition, a qualified beneficiary can continue the COBRA coverage until the earlier of (1) the remainder of the 18- or 36-month period or (2) the time when the preexisting-conditions provision no longer applies. Note that COBRA coverage is not affected by entitlement to benefits under Medicare or coverage under another group plan if this entitlement or coverage existed at the time of the qualifying event.\n\n\tIf a second qualifying event (such as the death or divorce of a terminated employee) occurs during the period of continued coverage, the maximum period of continuation is 36 months. For example, if an employee terminates employment, the employee and family are eligible for 18 months of COBRA coverage. If the employee dies after 15 months, a second qualifying event has occurred for the employee's spouse and dependent children. The normal period of COBRA continuation resulting from the death of an employee is 36 months. However, because the spouse and children have already had COBRA coverage for 15 months, the second qualifying event extends coverage for an additional 21 months.\n\n\tAt the termination of the COBRA period, a plan must offer a qualified beneficiary the right to convert to an individual insurance policy if a conversion privilege is generally available to employees under the plan.\n\n\tThe plan administrator must provide notification of the right to continue coverage at two times. First, when a plan becomes subject to COBRA or when a person becomes covered under a plan subject to COBRA, the administrator must give notification to an employee as well as to his or her spouse, generally within 90 days. A single letter to the employee and spouse satisfies this requirement as long as they reside at the same location. Second, when a qualifying event occurs, the employer must notify the plan administrator, who then must notify all qualified beneficiaries within 14 days. In general, the employer has 30 days to notify the plan administrator. However, an employer may not know of a qualifying event if it involves divorce, legal separation, or a child ceasing to be eligible for coverage. In these circumstances, the employee or family member must notify the employer within 60 days of the event, or the right to elect COBRA coverage is lost. The period for the employer to notify the plan administrator begins when the employer is informed of the qualifying event, as long as this occurs within the 60-day period.\n\n\tCOBRA rules also require plan administrators to provide notification to qualified beneficiaries in two other circumstances. First, if a plan beneficiary receives a notice of a qualifying event and the qualified beneficiary is ineligible for COBRA coverage, the plan administrators must explain why the qualified beneficiary is not entitled to coverage. Second, if the plan terminates COBRA coverage before the end of the maximum duration, the plan administrator must explain when and why the coverage is being terminated and inform the qualified beneficiary of any available rights to other coverage.\n\n\tContinuation of coverage is not automatic; a qualified beneficiary must elect it. The election period starts on the date of the qualifying event and may end not earlier than 60 days after actual notice of the event to the qualified beneficiary by the plan administrator. Once a beneficiary elects coverage, he or she has 45 days to pay the premium for the period of coverage prior to the election.\n\n\tUnder COBRA, the plan may pass the cost of the continued coverage to the qualified beneficiary, but the cost cannot exceed 102 percent of the cost to the plan for the period of coverage for a similarly situated active employee to whom a qualifying event has not occurred. The extra 2 percent is supposed to cover the employer's extra administrative costs. The one exception to this rule occurs for months 19 through 29 if an employee is disabled, in which case the premium can then be as high as 150 percent. Qualified beneficiaries must have the option of paying the premium in monthly installments. In addition, there must be a grace period of at least 30 days for each installment.\n\n\tAs a result of economic stimulus legislation, most persons who lose their jobs involuntarily between September 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009, are eligible for a federal subsidy of 65 percent of the COBRA premium for up to 9 months. The employer's plan charges the lower premium and receives reimbursement from the government. This subsidy was extended by additional legislation through May 31, 2010, after which the subsidy terminated. These COBRA beneficiaries receive the subsidy for fifteen months as long as they are not eligible for other group health coverage or Medicare.\n\n\tCOBRA has resulted in significant extra costs for employers. Precise statistics are difficult to obtain, but one insurer indicates that approximately 20 percent of those persons who are entitled to a COBRA continuation elect coverage. The length of coverage averages almost one year for persons eligible for an 18-month extension and almost 2 years for persons eligible for a 36-month extension. Although significant variations exist among employers, claim costs of persons with COBRA coverage generally run about 150 percent of claim costs for active employees and dependents. Moreover, administrative costs are estimated to be about $20 per month for each person with COBRA coverage.\n\nCoverage for Active Duty Military Personnel\n\n\tIn many cases, employees called to active military duty are eligible for COBRA. Employees who work for employers with fewer than 20 employees, however, are not. As a result, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act requires all employers to make COBRA-type coverage available to any person whose health plan coverage terminates because of an absence due to military service. The duration of available coverage is the shorter of (1) 24 months or (2) a period that ends on the day the individual fails to apply or return to a position of employment. The plan cannot require the person to pay more than 102 percent of the cost of the coverage. If the military service is for 30 or fewer days, however, the cost cannot exceed the normal employee share of any premium.\n\nSpecial Rules for Persons Eligible for Health Care Tax Credit\n\n\tThe Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2002 provides a health care tax credit (discussed later) to workers who have lost their jobs or whose hours of work and wages have been reduced because of imports. Workers are entitled to a second COBRA election period when they become eligible for the tax credit as long as the eligibility for the tax credit is within 6 months after the loss of their medical expense coverage. This second election period is available even if a worker initially declined COBRA coverage. The coverage, however, commences on the first day of the month in which a worker becomes eligible for the tax credit. Coverage can continue until the end of the period that would have applied to the original COBRA election period.\n\nContinuation of Coverage in Addition to COBRA\n\n\tEven before the passage of COBRA, it was becoming increasingly common for employers (particularly large employers) to continue group insurance coverage for certain employees-and sometimes their dependents-beyond the usual termination dates. Obviously, when an employer continues coverage now, the employer must at least comply with COBRA. However, an employer can be more liberal than COBRA by paying all or a portion of the cost, providing continued coverage for additional categories of persons, or continuing coverage for a longer period. Some states have so called \"mini-COBRA\" continuation laws for insured medical expense plans that might require a plan to make coverage available in situations not covered by COBRA. One example is coverage for employees of firms with fewer than 20 employees; another is coverage for periods longer than those required by COBRA.\n\nRetired Employees\n\n\tAlthough not required to do so by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, some employers continue coverage on retired employees. The majority of these employers continue coverage for the life of an employee, but some employers provide coverage only until the employee is eligible for Medicare. Although a plan may continue coverage for retirees' dependents, it is often limited only to spouses. Retired employees under age 65 usually have the same coverage as active employees have. However, coverage for employees aged 65 or older (if included under the same plan) may be provided under a Medicare carve-out or a Medicare supplement. If there is a lifetime maximum for persons eligible for Medicare, it is often lower than the limit for active employees.\n\n\tThe subject of retiree benefits became a major concern to employers since the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) phased in new rules between 1993 and 1997 for the accounting of postretirement benefits other than pensions. These rules require that employers do the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 recognize the present value of future retiree medical expense benefits on the firm's balance sheet with other liabilities\n\t\t\u2022 record the cost for postretirement medical benefits in the period when an employee performs services. This is comparable to the accounting for pension costs.\n\t\t\u2022 amortize the present value of the future cost of benefits accrued prior to the new rules\n\n\tThese rules are in contrast to the long-used previous practice of paying retiree medical benefits or premiums out of current revenue and recognizing these costs as expenses when paid. Although the rules are logical from a financial accounting standpoint, the effect on employers has been significant. Employers who elected to immediately recognize the liability had to show reduced earnings and net worth. Firms that elected to amortize the liability (often because immediate recognition would wipe out net worth) will be affected for years to come.\n\n\tThe FASB rules, along with the increasing cost of medical expense coverage, have resulted in two major changes by employers. First, many employers have reduced or eliminated retiree benefits or are considering such a change. One survey(Reference 27 below) indicates that the number of employers (with over 200 employees) that provide coverage to retirees has dropped from 66 percent in 1988 to 26 percent in 2011. Most of the employers provide coverage prior to Medicare eligibility and about 71 percent of them also provide benefits after Medicare eligibility. Some employers are not altering plans for current retirees or active employees who are eligible to retire. Instead, the changes apply to future retirees only. These changes, which seem to run the gamut, include the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 eliminating benefits for future retirees\n\n\t\t\u2022 shifting more of the cost burden to future retirees by reducing benefits. A plan may accomplish such a reduction by providing lower benefit maximums, covering fewer types of expenses, or increasing copayments.\n\n\t\t\u2022 adding or increasing retiree sharing of premium costs after retirement\n\n\t\t\u2022 shifting to a defined-contribution approach to funding retiree benefits. For example, an employer might agree to pay $5 per month toward the cost of coverage after retirement for each year of service by an employee. Thus, an employer would make a monthly contribution of $150 for an employee who retired with 30 years of service, but the employer would make a contribution of only $75 for an employee with 15 years of service. Some plans of this nature are designed so that the employer's contribution increases with changes in the consumer price index, subject to maximum increases (such as 5 percent per year).\n\n\t\t\u2022 encouraging retirees to elect benefits from managed care plans. With this approach, retirees are required to pay a significant portion of the cost if they continue coverage through a traditional indemnity plan.\n\n\tA second change is that some employers have explored methods to prefund the benefits. However, there are no alternatives for prefunding that are as favorable as the alternatives for funding pension benefits. One alternative is the use of a 501(c)(9) trust (or VEBA). There are limitations on the deductibility of contributions to a 501(c)(9) trust. Furthermore, an employer can use a 501(c)(9) trust to fund retiree benefits only if it also uses the trust to fund benefits for active employees.\n\n\tAnother alternative is to prefund medical benefits within a pension plan. Contributions are tax deductible, and earnings accumulate tax free. The IRS rules for qualified retirement plans permit the payment of benefits for medical expenses from a pension plan if the following requirements are satisfied:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The medical benefits must be subordinate to the retirement benefits. A pension plan meets this rule if the cost of the medical benefits provided does not exceed 25 percent of the employer's aggregate contribution to the plan. For many employers, this figure is too low to allow the entire future liability to be prefunded.\n\n\t\t\u2022 There must be a separate account for the monies allocated to medical benefits. Nonkey employees can have an aggregate account, but separate individual accounts must be maintained for key employees, and medical benefits attributable to a key employee (and his or her family members) can be made only from the key employee's account.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The employer's contributions for medical benefits must be ascertainable and reasonable.\n\n\tAlthough the rules for funding retiree medical benefits in a pension plan are restricted and administratively complex, they offer an employer the opportunity to deduct at least a portion of the cost of prefunded benefits.\n\nSurviving Dependents\n\n\tA plan can also continue coverage for the survivors of deceased active employees and/or deceased retired employees. However, plans do not commonly continue coverage for the survivors of active employees beyond the period required by COBRA, and coverage for the survivors of retired employees may be limited to surviving spouses. In both instances, the continued coverage is usually identical to what the survivor had prior to the employee's death. It is also common for the employer to continue the same premium contribution level.\n\nLaid-off Employees\n\n\tAn employer may continue medical expense coverage for laid-off workers, and large employers frequently provide such coverage for a limited period. Few employers provide coverage beyond the period required by COBRA, but some employers continue to make the same premium contribution, at least for a limited period.\n\nDisabled Employees\n\n\tMedical expense coverage can be continued for an employee (and dependents) when he or she has a temporary interruption of employment, including one arising from illness or injury. Many employers also cover employees who have long-term disabilities or who have retired because of a disability. In most cases, this continuation of coverage is contingent on satisfaction of some definition of total (and possibly permanent) disability. When continuing coverage for disabled employees, an employer must determine the extent of employer contributions. For example, the employer may continue the same premium contribution as for active employees, although there is nothing to prevent a different contribution rate-either lower or higher.\n\nDomestic Partners\n\n\tDomestic partners do not meet the definition of qualified beneficiary for purposes of COBRA. However, some employers provide domestic partners who have coverage under the employer's plan with continuation coverage that is similar or identical to what is available under COBRA.\n\nExtension of Benefits\n\n\tWhen coverage terminates rather than continues, most medical expense plans have an extension of benefits for any covered employee or dependent who is totally disabled at the time of termination. However, the disability must have resulted from an illness or injury that occurred while the person was covered under the plan's insurance contract. Generally, the same level of benefits is available as before termination. Although some contracts cover only expenses associated with the same cause of disability, other contracts cover any expenses that would have been paid under the terminated coverage, regardless of cause.\n\n\tAs a rule, the extension of benefits generally ceases after 12 months, or when the individual is no longer totally or continuously disabled, whichever comes first.\n\nConversion\n\n\tExcept when termination results from the failure to pay any required premiums, medical expense contracts usually contain (and are often required to contain) a conversion provision. With such a provision, a plan allows covered persons whose group coverage terminates to purchase individual medical expense coverage without evidence of insurability and without any limitation of benefits for preexisting conditions. Covered persons commonly have 31 days from the date of termination of the group coverage to exercise this conversion privilege, and coverage is then effective retroactively to the date of termination.\n\n\tThis conversion privilege is typically given to any employee who has been insured under the group contract (or under any group contract it replaced) for at least 3 months, and it permits the employee to convert his or her own coverage as well as any dependent coverage. In addition, a spouse or child whose dependent coverage ceases for any other reason may also be eligible for conversion (for example, a spouse who divorces or separates, and children who reach age 19).\n\n\tState laws and insurance company practices vary with respect to the conversion provision and COBRA. In some cases, conversion is contingent upon an individual electing COBRA coverage and maintaining it for the maximum election period. At that time, a conversion policy is available. In other cases, a person who is eligible for both the conversion privilege and the right to continue the group insurance coverage under COBRA has two choices when eligibility for coverage terminates. He or she can either elect to convert under the provisions of the policy or elect to continue the group coverage under COBRA. If the person makes the latter choice, the COBRA rules specify that the person must again be eligible to convert to an individual policy within the usual conversion period (31 days) after the maximum continuation-of-coverage period ceases. In either situation, policy provisions may also make the conversion privilege available to persons whose coverage terminates prior to the end of the maximum continuation period. If a covered person elects the conversion option, there are no COBRA rights if the conversion policy terminates.\n\n\tThe provider of the medical expense coverage has the right to refuse the issue of a \"conversion\" policy to anyone (1) who has Medicare coverage or (2) whose benefits under the converted policy, together with similar benefits from other sources, would result in overinsurance according to the insurance company's standards. These similar benefits may be in other coverages that the individual has (either group or individual coverage) or for which the individual is eligible under any group arrangement.\n\n\tThe use of the word conversion is often a misnomer. In actuality, a person whose coverage terminates only has the right to purchase a contract on an individual basis at individual rates. Most Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and some HMO plans offer a conversion policy that is similar or identical to the terminated group coverage. However, most insurance companies offer a conversion policy (or a choice of policies) that contains a lower level of benefits than existed under the group coverage. Traditionally, the conversion policy contained only basic hospital and surgical coverages even if the group contract provided major medical coverage. Now many insurance companies provide (and are required to provide in many states) a conversion policy that includes major medical benefits, which do not necessarily have to be as broad as those under the former group coverage. To protect themselves from legal liability, employers should emphasize any lower level of coverage to individuals electing conversion.\n\n\tSome plans offer a conversion policy that another entity issues. For example, an HMO might enter into a contractual arrangement with an insurance company. In some cases, the HMO and insurance company are commonly owned or have a parent-subsidiary relationship.\n\n\tSelf-funded plans, which are exempt from state laws mandating a conversion policy, may still provide such a benefit. Rather than providing coverage directly to the terminated employee, the plan usually enters into an agreement with an insurance company to make a policy available. This agreement is typically part of a broader contract with the insurer to also provide administrative services and/or stop-loss protection. Because the availability of a conversion policy results in a charge (such as $0.65 per employee per month), most self-funded plans do not provide any continuation of coverage beyond what COBRA requires.\n\n\tThe conversion option has never been widely used. In many cases, persons obtain coverage from another employer. If they remain unemployed, they often cannot afford the coverage and find it from a less expensive source. In addition, they can now obtain other coverage under the HIPM portability rules. However, in some cases, conversion provides better coverage if the person can afford it.\n\nGroup-to-Individual Portability\n\n\tHIPM makes it easier for individuals who lose group medical expense coverage to find alternative coverage in the individual marketplace. The purpose of the federal legislation seems to be to encourage states to adopt their own mechanisms to achieve this goal. The federal rules apply in a state only if the state fails to have its own plan in effect.\n\n\tMost states have adopted their own plans so that the federal rules do not apply. However, the state alternative must do all the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 provide a choice of health insurance coverage to all eligible individuals\n\t\t\u2022 not impose any preexisting-conditions restrictions\n\t\t\u2022 include at least one policy form of coverage that is either comparable to comprehensive health coverage offered in the individual marketplace or comparable to or a standard option of coverage available under the group or individual laws of the state\n\n\tIn addition, the state must implement one of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 one of the NAIC model laws on individual market reform\n\t\t\u2022 a qualified high-risk pool\n\t\t\u2022 certain other mechanisms specified in the act\n\n\tIf a state fails to adopt an alternative to federal regulation, then insurance companies, HMOs, and other health plan providers in the individual marketplace are required to make coverage available on a guaranteed-issue basis to individuals with 18 or more months of creditable coverage and whose most recent coverage was under a group health plan. However, they do not have to offer coverage to an individual who has other health insurance or who is eligible for COBRA coverage, Medicare, or Medicaid. If they provide coverage, they can impose no preexisting-conditions exclusions. Health insurers have three options for providing coverage to eligible individuals:\n\n\t\t\u2022 They may offer every health insurance policy they offer in the state.\n\t\t\u2022 They may offer their two most popular policies in the state, based on premium volume.\n\t\t\u2022 They may offer a low-level and a high-level coverage as long as they contain benefits that are similar to other coverage the insurer offers in the state.\n\n\tRules similar to those for group medical expense insurance coverage require the renewal of individual coverage.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n27.

Also, you can see a physician outside of the network and you'll probably have your cost covered (although likely at a lower rate than for in-network physicians).

Violations of HIPAA's fraud and abuse standards or its confidentiality provisions could result in fines and/or imprisonment.\n\tThe term \"federal health care offense\" includes knowingly obtaining money from a health care benefit program under false pretenses, stealing or embezzling from a health benefit plan, or falsifying or concealing a material fact. Therefore, in addition to any penalties for fiduciary breach under ERISA, plans may be subject to criminal penalties ranging from fines to life imprisonment.(Reference 1 below)\n\tPointer: Employers should review health plan documents and require providers to disclose any fraud and abuse they are aware of. They also need to specifically define who is covered in their plan. An example of a violation may include allowing an employee to cover a grandchild or boyfriend when the plan does not recognize those relationships for coverage.\n\tExpansion of federal health care offense. As of March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) has expanded the definition of \"federal health care offense\" to include crimes barring an individual from serving as a plan administrator or fiduciary under ERISA as well as coercive interference with benefit plan rights.(Reference 2 below)\n\tConfidentiality. Protecting confidentiality becomes critically important. In an effort to simplify plan administration, HIPAA makes it a federal crime to knowingly use, obtain, or disclose individually identifiable health information without authorization. The penalty for wrongful disclosure includes fines, ranging from $50,000 to $250,000, or imprisonment for up to 10 years.(Reference 3 below)\n\n\tPointer: Employers need to have policies and procedures in place to protect the confidentiality of any information handled by them or their claims administrators. The chain of liability could include whoever knows and could be applicable to past, present, and future medical histories.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 730 - Health Benefits - HIPAA: Security of Medical Records\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued final security regulations, which describe how covered entities are to safeguard and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI).\n\t\n\tThe security rule differs from the privacy rule because it describes how data is to be protected while under the control of a covered entity, while the privacy rule describes under what conditions data can be released by covered entities. The security rule also differs in scope from the privacy rule, applying only to electronically transmitted protected health information (PHI), while the privacy rule applies to all forms of PHI.\n\t\n\tThe security rule works in concert with the privacy rule, using many of the same terms and definitions in order to make it easier for covered entities to comply. Certain requirements of the security regulations also mirror those found in the privacy regulations. For instance, the requirement in the security regulations that plan sponsors with access to PHI amend their plan documents to provide that the plan sponsor will comply with the security regulations is similar to the requirement found in the privacy rule.\n\n\tPlan amendments. The security regulations also add a standard for group health plans under which plan sponsors who only have access to PHI in summary health information or for enrollment and disenrollment purposes do not need to amend their plans. However, plan sponsors who access ePHI for other purposes must amend their plans to incorporate provisions that require the plan sponsor to:\n\t\t\u25a1 implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect ePHI that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of the group health plan;\n\t\t\u25a1 ensure that the security measure provides for adequate separation (\"firewalls\");\n\t\t\u25a1 ensure that any agents, including subcontractors, to whom it provides this information agree to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards;\n\t\t\u25a1 report to the group health plan any security incident of which it becomes aware; and\n\t\t\u25a1 make its policies and procedures and documentation relating to these safeguards available to the Secretary for purposes of determining the group health plan's compliance with these requirements.\\\n\n\tUnder the rule, covered entities also are required to:\n\t\t\u25a1 implement physical safeguards to restrict access to data at workstations;\n\t\t\u25a1 assign a unique identifier to data users;\n\t\t\u25a1 audit logs, access reports, and security incident reports;\n\t\t\u25a1 implement procedures that terminate an electronic session after a period of inactivity;\n\t\t\u25a1 sanction workforce members for noncompliance with security policies and procedures; and\n\t\t\u25a1 implement a security awareness and training program for all employees.\n\n\tBusiness associate contracts. Business associate contracts must include requirements that the business associate has security policies and procedures similar to the covered entity. Because of variations in the size, complexity, and capabilities, of covered entities, they are given flexibility under the security rule in determining how they implement the security standards.\n\n\tRisk management strategies. Protecting ePHI is challenging as technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace. The list of devices that are vulnerable to security breaches include laptops, removable/transportable memory, backup media, email, personal digital assistants/smart phones, public workstations and wire\u00ad less access points, home-based PCs, and even printers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has recommended some risk management strategies, including:\n\t\u25a1 two-factor authentication (i.e., user ID and password); D delineated roles and responsibilities for remote access; \n\t\u25a1 encryption;\n\t\u25a1 firewalls;\n\t\u25a1 updates to virus-protection software, ad-aware, and spam blocking; D lock-down or locking mechanisms;\n\t\u25a1 password protection of files; and\n\t\u25a1 session termination.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 725 - Health Benefits - HIPAA: Privacy of Medical Records\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released final regulations designed to secure the confidentiality of health plan participants' medical information. The final regulations extend privacy protection to all types of personal health information, including medical records and other individually identifiable health information, created or held by covered entities, including oral records and paper records that have not existed in electronic form. Covered entities include health plans (including employer-sponsored plans), health care clearing\u00ad houses, and health care providers.(Reference 1 below)\n\tProtected health information. With few exceptions, an individual's protected health information (PHI) can be used for health purposes only. This includes such things as health care treatment, payment, and operations. PHI is defined as all individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained by a covered entity, whether communicated electronically, on paper, or orally.(Reference 2 below) Health information cannot be used for purposes not related to health care, such as use by employers to make personnel decisions or use by financial institutions, without explicit authorization from the individual. Disclosures of information must be limited to the minimum necessary for the purpose of the disclosure. This rule does not apply to the transfers of medical records for treatment purposes because physicians and other providers need access to the full medical record.(Reference 3 below)\n\tNot all medical information kept by a company is protected PHI. Whether it is protected depends on whether an entity creates or receives the information in its role as an employer or in its role as a group health plan, and thus as a covered entity. For example, when an individual gives his or her medical information to the covered entity as the employer, such as when submitting a doctor's statement to document sick leave, or when the covered entity as employer obtains the employee's written authorization for disclosure of protected health information, such as an authorization to disclose the results of a fitness for duty examination, that medical information becomes part of the employment record, and, as such, is no longer protected health information. (Remember, though, that the covered entity as employer may be subject to other laws and regulations applicable to the use or disclosure of information in an employee's employment record).(Reference 4 below)\n\tHealth plan defined. A \"health plan\" includes any employee welfare benefit plan as defined under ERISA Sec. 3(1) (regardless of whether it is insured or self\u00adinsured) to the extent that the plans provide medical care, an HMO, a long-term care policy, an employee welfare benefit plan that provides health care to the employees of two or more employers, and any other individual or group health plan that provides or pays for the cost of medical care. Health FSAs are, therefore, covered by the privacy rule.(Reference 5 below)\n\tNotice requirements. The privacy rules require covered entities to provide patients with notice of the patients' privacy rights and the privacy practices of the covered entity, although this requirement is optional for health plans. The strengthened notice requires direct treatment providers to make a good faith effort to obtain patients' written acknowledgement of the notice of privacy rights and practices.(Reference 6 below)\n\tDisclosure of full medical record for treatment. For most disclosures, such as information submitted with bills, covered entities are required to send only the minimum information needed for the purpose of the disclosure. Under the final rules, however, providers are given full discretion to determine what personal health information to include when sending patients' medical records to other providers for treatment purposes.(Reference 7 below)\n\tRequired procedures. The final regulation establishes privacy safeguard standards that covered entities must meet but it leaves detailed policies and procedures for meeting these standards to the discretion of each covered entity. Covered entities must:\n\t\t\u25a1 Adopt written privacy procedures, including who has access to protected information, how it will be used within the entity, and when the information would or would not be disclosed to others. They must also take steps to ensure that their business associates protect the privacy of health information.\n\t\t\u25a1 Train employees and designate a privacy officer. Covered entities must provide sufficient training so that their employees understand the new privacy protection procedures and designate an individual to be responsible for ensuring the procedures are followed.\n\t\t\u25a1 Establish grievance processes. Covered entities must provide a means for patients to make inquiries or complaints regarding the privacy of their records.(Reference 8 below)\n\tPointer: The HHS generally does not consider facility redesigns, such as office space redesigns or computer system upgrades, as necessary to meet the reasonableness standard for minimum necessary uses. However, covered entities may need to make certain adjustments to their facilities to minimize access, such as isolating and locking file cabinets or records rooms, or providing additional security, such as passwords, on computers maintaining personal information.\n\tOral communications. According to the HHS, although covered entities must take reasonable safeguards to protect PHI, it is not expected that these safeguards guarantee the privacy of PHI from any and all potential risks. In determining whether safeguards are reasonable, HHS will take into account all the circumstances, including the potential effects on patient care and the financial and administrative burden of any safeguards. Covered entities will not be required to soundproof rooms, provide private rooms for each communication, or encrypt their telephones as long as reasonable safeguards, such as speaking with lowered voices, are taken. Also, the guidelines clarify that covered entities do not need to provide patients access to oral information.(Reference 9 below)\n\tMinimum necessary requirement. HIPM requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to limit the use or disclosure of, and requests for PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The rule requires that for all uses and many disclosures and requests for disclosures, covered entities implement policies and procedures for minimum necessary uses and disclosures. These policies and procedures will allow covered entities to avoid making a \"minimum necessary\" determination on a case-by-case basis. To allow covered entities the flexibility to address their unique circumstances, the rule requires covered entities to make their own assessment of what PHI is reasonably necessary for a particular purpose, given the characteristics of their business and workforce, and to implement policies and procedures accordingly.This is not a strict standard and covered entities need not limit information uses or disclosures to those that are absolutely needed to serve the purpose. Rather, this is a \n\treasonableness standard that calls for an approach consistent with the best practices and guidelines already used by many providers today to limit the unnecessary sharing of medical information.(Reference 10 below)\n\tPrivacy breaches. Privacy provisions for PHI set forth in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (ARRA) must be followed by both business associates and covered entities. A breach of privacy is defined in ARRA as unauthorized acquisition, access, or use, or disclosure of PHI which compromises security or privacy of PHI except where an unauthorized person would not reasonably have been able to retain PHI.(Reference 11 below)\n\tDefinition of ''breach.\" The term \"breach\" means the acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule that compromises the security or privacy of the PHl.(Reference 12 below) Compromising the security or privacy of the PHI means posing a significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to the individual. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI constitutes a breach, covered entities and business associates will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is a significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. In performing the risk assessment, covered entities and business associates should consider the following factors:\n\t\t\u25a1 the type and amount of protected health information involved;\n\t\t\u25a1 who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;\n\t\t\u25a1 whether the covered entity took immediate steps to mitigate an impermissible use or disclosure; and\n\t\t\u25a1 whether PHI was returned prior to it being accessed for an improper purpose.(Reference 13 below)\n\t\n\tBreach exclusions. A breach does not occur in the following situations:\n\t\t1. any unintentional acquisition, access, or use of PHI by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a covered entity or a business associate if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority and does not result in further use or disclosure in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule;\n\t\t2. any inadvertent disclosure by a person who is authorized to access PHI at a covered entity or business associate to another person authorized to access PHI at the same covered entity or business associate, or organized health care arrangement in which the covered entity participates, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted under the Privacy Rule; and\n\t\t3. a disclosure of PHI where a covered entity or business associate has a good faith belief that an authorized person to whom the disclosure was made would not reasonably have been able to retain such information.(Reference 14 below)\n\tExample: A billing employee receives and opens an e-mail containing PHI that a nurse mistakenly sent to the employee. The billing employee notices that he is not the intended recipient, alerts the nurse of the misdirected e-mail, and then deletes it. The billing employee's use of the information was done in good faith and within the scope of authority, and, therefore, would not constitute a breach and notification would not be required, provided the employee did not further use or disclose the information accessed in a manner not permitted by the Privacy Rule.\n\tExample: A receptionist at a covered entity who is not authorized to access PHI decides to look through patient files in order to learn of a friend's treatment. In this case, the impermissible access to PHI would not fall within the exceptions because such access was neither unintentional, done in good faith, nor within the scope of authority.\n\tExample: A covered entity, due to a lack of reasonable safeguards, sends a number of explanations of benefits (EOBs) to the wrong individuals. A few of the EOBs are returned by the post office, unopened, as undeliverable. In these circumstances, the covered entity can conclude that the improper addressees could not reasonably have retained the information. The EOBs that were not returned as undeliverable, however, and that the covered entity knows were sent to the wrong individuals, should be treated as potential breaches.\n\tBreach notice requirements. In instances of breach, ARRA requires notification of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed as a result of the breach. If a business associate discovers the breach, it must notify the covered entity, and a covered entity must make notification to the HHS no later than 60 calendar days after the discovery of the breach. In situations where a major breach covering the PHI of more than 500 individuals occurs, notice must be provided to prominent media outlets in the appropriate state or jurisdiction. Major breaches must be provided to the HHS immediately. Breaches covering fewer than 500 individuals require the covered entity to maintain a log of the breaches and submit it on an annual basis to the HHS.(Reference 15 below) The privacy rules require covered entities to provide patients with notice of the patient's privacy rights and the privacy practices of the covered entity, although this requirement is\noptional for health plans.(Reference 16 below) The strengthened notice requires direct treatment providers to make a good faith effort to obtain patient's written acknowledgment of the notice of privacy rights and practices.(Reference 17 below)\n\tHHS has clarified that the breach notification requirements only apply to unsecured PHI, which is PHI not secured through HHS-approved technology or guidance. In addition, once PHI is rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals by one or more HHS-approved method, such as encryption or destruction, then such information is not considered to be unsecured PH1.(Reference below)\n\tContent of breach notice. Final regulations require the breach notification to include, to the extent possible, the following elements:\n\t\t1. a brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;\n\t\t2. a description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code, or other types of information were involved);\n\t\t3. any steps individuals should take to protect themselves from potential harm resulting from the breach;\n\t\t4. a brief description of what the covered entity involved is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals, and to protect against any further breaches; and\n\t\t5. contact procedures for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which must include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, Web site, or postal address.(Reference 19 below)\n\tMethods of notification. A covered entity must provide breach notice to the individual in written form by first-class mail at the last known address of the individual. Written notice may be in the form of electronic mail, provided the individual agrees to receive electronic notice and such agreement has not been withdrawn.(Reference 20 below) Where the individual affected by a breach is a minor or otherwise lacks legal capacity due to a physical or mental condition, notice to the parent or other person who is the personal representative of the individual will satisfy these requirements. If an individual is deceased, such notice may be sent to either the individual's next of kin or personal representative.\n\tIf a covered entity does not have sufficient contact information for some or all of the affected individuals, or if some notices are returned as undeliverable, the covered entity must provide substitute notice for the unreachable individuals.(Reference 21 below) If there are fewer than 10 individuals for whom the covered entity has insufficient or out-of-date contact information to provide the written notice, the covered entity may provide substitute notice to such individuals through an alternative form of written notice, by telephone, or other means. If a covered entity has insufficient or out-of\u00ad date contact information for 10 or more individuals, the covered entity must provide substitute notice through either a conspicuous posting for a period of 90 days on the home page of its Web site or conspicuous notice in major print or broadcast media in geographic areas where the individuals affected by the breach likely reside.(Reference 22 below)\n\tNotification to the media. Covered entities must provide notice to prominent media outlets serving a state or jurisdiction following the discovery of a breach if the unsecured PHI of more than 500 residents of such state or jurisdiction is, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach. A covered entity must notify prominent media outlets without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach.(Reference 23 below) Notification to the media must include the same information required to be included in the notification to the individual (see \"Content of breach notice\" discussion above) .(Reference 24 below)\n\tNotification to the HHS Secretary. Covered entities must notify the Secretary of breaches of unsecured PHI. For breaches involving 500 or more individuals, covered entities must notify the Secretary immediately and, at the same time, provide individual notification (as discussed above).(Reference 25 below) The notification must be provided in a manner to be specified on the HHS Web site. HHS will post instructions on its Web site for submitting this notification.(Reference 26 below)\n\tFor breaches involving less than 500 individuals, covered entities may maintain a log of such breaches and annually submit such log to the Secretary documenting the breaches occurring during the year involved.(Reference 27 below) The log must be submitted no later than 60 days after the end of each calendar year. The information must be provided to the Secretary in the manner specified on the HHS Web site. HHS will specify on its Web site the information to be submitted and how to submit such information.(Reference 28 below)\n\tNotification by a business associate. Following the discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI, a business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach no later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. (Reference 29 below) Business associates, to the extent possible, must provide covered entities with the identity of each individual whose unsecured PHI has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached.(Reference 30 below)\n\tBusiness associates. The requirements that covered entities have under the HIPM privacy rule now apply directly to their business associates. Covered entities have to obtain satisfactory assurances through written agreements from their business associates who have access to protected health information that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information.(Reference 31 below) HHS has clarified, however, that a covered entity is not liable for privacy violations of a business associate and that covered entities do not have to actively monitor the means by which the business associate carries out safeguards. Business associate relation\u00ad ships arise when a covered entity has the right to use or disclose protected health information and another party is using that information to perform a function or activity on behalf of the covered entity. Members of a covered entity's workforce are not business associates and entities that share common ownership or control can be designated as one covered \nentity.(Reference 32 below)\n \n\tSome of the items that should appear in a business associate agreement include:\n\t\t\u25a1 ways the business associate is permitted to use PHI;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate follow appropriate safeguards;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate report PHI violations to the plan;\n\t\t\u25a1 a requirement that the business associate return or destroy PHI when feasible; and\n\t\t\u25a1 a provision providing for termination of the agreement if a \"material breach\" occurs.(Reference 33 below)\n\n\tThe Department of Health and Human Services included sample business associate contract provisions in the preamble of the privacy rule.\n\tDisclosure of enrollment information. The final rule allows a group health plan, a health insurance issuer, or HMO acting for a group health plan to disclose to a plan sponsor, such as an employer, information on whether the individual is enrolled in or has disenrolled from a plan offered by the sponsor without amending the plan documents.(Reference 34 below)\n\tIndividual rights. HIPPA also allows individuals to control, to some extent, how their protected health information will be used. For example, individuals have the right to:\n\t\t\u25a1 obtain a notice of how a covered entity will use and disclose their protected health information;\n\t\t\u25a1 request restrictions on the uses and disclosures of their protected health information for treatment, payment, and health care operations;\n\t\t\u25a1 request restrictions on the uses and disclosures for which neither a consent nor authorization is required;\n\t\t\u25a1 access, inspect and copy their health information;\n\t\t\u25a1 request an amendment to their health information; and\n\t\t\u25a1 request an accounting of disclosures of their protected health information. (Reference 35 below)\n\n\tPrivacy officers. To administer all of these rules, HIPM requires that covered entities designate a privacy officer. This privacy officer is responsible for the implementation and development of the entity's privacy policies and proce\u00ad dures. There must also be a person designated to receive complaints and provide information regarding privacy. This person may or may not be the privacy officer.(Reference 36 below)\n\tInternal policies and procedures. HIPM requires covered entities to implement policies and procedures with respect to PHI that are designed to comply with \"all the requirements of the HIPM privacy rule.\" (Reference 37 below)\n \n\tState laws. Stronger state laws, such as those covering mental health or AIDS information, continue to apply. The final rules set a national \"floor\" of privacy standards.\n\tPenalties. HIPAA provides civil and criminal penalties for covered entities that misuse personal health information. Civil monetary penalties for unintentional disclosures are $100 per incident, up to $25,000 per person, per year, per standard.\n\tFederal criminal penalties could be imposed for health plans, providers, and clearinghouses that knowingly and improperly disclose information or obtain information under false pretenses. Penalties would be higher for actions to generate financial gain. Criminal penalties are up to $50,000 and one year in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information (PHD; up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison for obtaining PHI under \"false pretenses\"; and up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for obtaining or disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer, or use it for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.(Reference 38 below)\n\tRevised civil penalties. Pursuant to a portion of ARRA called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH), the penalties for noncompliance with the HIPAA privacy and data security requirements were increased. Under the HITECH Act, HHS is required to impose a civil monetary penalty for noncompliance due to willful neglect. The penalties apply to health plans, as well as business associates.(Reference 39 below)\n\tThe HIPAA civil monetary penalties have been adjusted as follows:(Reference 40 below)\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each pre-February 2009 violation of the HIPAA administrative simplification provision: $159 (up from $155), with a calendar year cap of $39,936 (up from $38,954).\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which a covered entity or business associate did not know and, by exercising reasonable diligence, would not have known that violation occurred: $117 minimum (up from $114), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which it is established that the violation was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect $1,170 minimum (up from $1,141), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which the violation was due to willful neglect and timely corrected (generally within 30 days): $11,698 minimum (up from $11,410), $58,490 maximum (up from $57,051), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.\n\t\u25a1 Penalty for each February 2009 or later violation of a HIPAA administrative simplification provision in which the violation was due to willful neglect, but not timely corrected: $58,490 minimum (up from $57,051), $1,754,698 maxi\u00ad mum (up from $1,711,533), with a calendar year cap of $1,754,698.11725\n \n\tIf HHS fails to act, the law allows state attorneys general to bring civil lawsuits to enforce penalties.(Reference 41 below)\n\tHITECH regulations. Final HHS rules strengthened and expanded enforcement of privacy, security, and enforcement rules in HIPM and the subsequently issued HITECH Act by implementing the following measures:\n\t\t1) expanded individuals' rights to access their information and to restrict certain types of disclosures of protected health information (PHD to health plans. Patients can ask for a copy of their electronic medical record in an electronic form;(Reference 42 below)\n\t\t2) required business associates of HIPM-covered entities to follow most of the same rules as the covered entities;\n\t\t3) set new limitations on the use and disclosure of PHI for marketing and fundraising;(Reference 43 below)\n\t\t4) prohibited the sale of PHI without patient authorization. Under the regulations, if a covered entity is to receive remuneration for the sale of PHI, it would have to include in the authorization a statement that the disclosure will result in remuneration to the covered entity.(Reference 44 below)\n\n\tThe final regulations also modified the individual authorization and other requirements to facilitate research and disclosure of child immunization proof to schools.(Reference 45 below), and.\n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.HHS Reg. \u00a7 160.103.\n2.

A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 -  Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - Health Savings Accounts\n\nHealth Savings Accounts (HSAs)\n\n\tIn addition to providing prescription drug coverage for older Americans, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established health savings accounts (HSAs). HSAs are designed as successors to Archer MSAs, which are briefly discussed later, and the two have many features in common. However, they also have some notable differences that make HSAs more attractive than Archer MSAs and available to a much larger pool of consumers.\n\n\tHSAs were allowed as early as 2004. Various surveys indicate that by 2009 there were 6 to 7 million people with high-deductible health plans that met the criteria for them to also have HSAs. About three-quarters of these people have such health plans through employer-provided medical expense arrangements, but only about half of this group have either established HSAs or had their employers establish HSAs for them.\n\nGeneral Nature\n\n\tAn HSA is a personal savings account from which unreimbursed medical expenses, including deductibles, percentage participation, and copayments, can be paid. The HSA must be in the form of a tax-exempt trust or custodial account established in conjunction with a high-deductible health (medical expense) plan. An HSA is established with a qualified trustee or custodian in much the same way that an IRA is established. Any insurance company or bank (as well as certain other financial institutions) can be a trustee or custodian, as can any other person or entity already approved by the IRS as a trustee or custodian for IRAs.\n\n\tHSAs are individual trusts, which prohibits a husband and wife from having a joint HSA. But as long as both are eligible, each may have a separate HSA.\n\n\tSome insurers that sell high-deductible health plans for use with HSAs also market the HSA accounts; other insurers leave it to the purchasers of a high-deductible health plan to establish their HSAs with other institutions.\n\n\tEven though employers can sponsor HSAs, these accounts are established for the benefit of individuals and are portable. If an employee changes employers or leaves the workforce, the HSA, including the balance in the account, remains with the individual.\n\nEligibility\n\n\tEmployees, the self-employed, and anyone else can establish HSAs as long as they meet the following rules for qualification:\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual must be covered by a high-deductible health plan. That plan may be insured or self-insured if offered by an employer as long as it meets the criteria for a qualifying high-deductible plan.\n\n\t\t\u2022 The individual is not eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person's federal income tax return.\n\n\t\t\u2022 With some exceptions, a person who is covered under a high-deductible health plan is denied eligibility for an HSA if he or she is covered under another health plan that does not meet the definition of a high-deductible plan but that provides any benefits that are covered under the high-deductible health plan. The exceptions include coverage for accident, disability, dental care, vision care, and long-term care as well as liability insurance, insurance for a specified disease or illness, and insurance paying a fixed amount per period of hospitalization. Participation in a typical FSA would make an individual ineligible to participate in an HSA unless the FSA only provided reimbursement for types of expenses not covered under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\n\tAn employer can establish HSAs for its employees, or an individual (whether employed or not) may establish his or her own HSA.\n\nHigh-Deductible Health Plan\n\n\tFor purposes of HSA participation, a high-deductible health plan is defined as having the following deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limitations for covered services. These figures are for 2012 and subject to annual inflation adjustments:\n\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of self-only coverage, the deductible must be at least $1,200, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $6,050.\n\t\t\u2022 In the case of family coverage, the deductible must be at least $2,400, and annual out-of-pocket expenses cannot exceed $12,100.\n\n\tIf these high-deductible plans use preferred-provider networks, they can have higher out-of-pocket limits for services provided outside the network, and any deductibles for nonnetwork services are not taken into account when determining the out-of-pocket limits specified above.\n\n\tOne point should be emphasized about the deductible for family coverage. It is not a family deductible as was described in the discussion on major medical insurance. In that situation, there is an individual deductible that\napplies to each family member as well as a separate deductible for the family. This is sometimes referred to as an embedded deductible, and the policy pays benefits for any family member once his or her deductible is satisfied, even if the family deductible is not yet met.\n\n\tIn the case of a high-deductible policy used with an HSA, there will usually not be an individual deductible if a policy is written for a family. Rather, there will be a single deductible-referred to as a common deductible-that must be satisfied before any benefits are payable, even if all claims are for one family member. It is permissible, however, to use an embedded deductible, but only if the individual deductible is equal to at least the required HSA family deductible of $2,400.\n\n\tThe following incurred expenses do not count toward the plan's required deductible and out-of-pocket limit:\n\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services not covered by the high-deductible health plan\n\t\t\u2022 payments for services received from nonnetwork health care providers, if the plan uses a preferred-provider network\n\t\t\u2022 amounts above a plan's reasonable allowable specific service maximums\n\t\t\u2022 amounts in excess of reasonable and customary fees \n\t\t\u2022 penalties for failure to obtain a plan-required certification\n\n\tNevertheless, copayments and required percentage participation count toward the out-of-pocket limit, even if the plan does not consider them as contributing toward the satisfaction of the deductible. In addition, the deductible amount counts towards the out-of-pocket limit. However, employee contributions paid for the coverage do not count.\n\nPreventive Care\n\n\tGenerally, a high-deductible health plan established in conjunction with an HSA cannot provide benefits before the deductible is satisfied, but there is an exception for benefits for preventive care. A high-deductible health plan may provide benefits for the following preventive care services before the insured satisfies the plan's required high deductible:\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual physicals, immunizations, and screening services\n\n\t\t\u2022 routine prenatal and well-child care\n\n\t\t\u2022 tobacco cessation programs and obesity weight-loss programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 employee-assistance, disease management, or wellness programs\n\n\t\t\u2022 treatment of a related condition that is incidental or ancillary to a preventive care service or screening, such as removal of polyps during a diagnostic colonoscopy\n\n\t\t\u2022 drugs or medications taken by a person who has developed risk factors for a disease before the disease manifests itself or to prevent the reoccurrence of a disease from which the person has recovered. An example is the drug treatment of high cholesterol to prevent heart disease, or the treatment of recovered heart attack or stroke victims with medications to prevent a recurrence. Other prescription drugs that do not qualify under this exception remain subject to the plan's high deductible.\n\nPreventive care must be offered with no cost-sharing.\n\nContributions\n\n\tContributions to an HSA may be made solely by individuals who have such accounts. They may also be made by employers that provide their employees with a high-deductible health plan.\n\nIndividual Contributions\n\n\tIndividuals often fund HSAs without employer contributions because they are not employees or because their employer makes no contribution to HSAs. Contributions must be in the form of cash, and they are deductible for federal income tax purposes even if the individual does not itemize deductions.\n\n\tThe maximum annual contribution to an HSA in 2012 is $3,100 if the account holder has self-only coverage and $6,250 if the account holder has family coverage. These amounts are subject to annual indexing for inflation. As a result of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the full maximum contribution is allowed even if it exceeds the policy deductible amount under the high-deductible health plan.\n\n\tIf both a husband and wife establish an HSA and have family coverage (that is, a single policy covering both of them), they can allocate the maximum contribution in any way they determine. If they have separate policies, each is subject to the limits that apply to self-only coverage.\n\n\tIndividuals aged 55 or older are also permitted an additional annual catch-up contribution of up to $1,000. If both a husband and wife are aged 55 or older, the catch-up contribution is available to each of them only if they have separate HSAs.\n\n\tAnnual contributions can be made in a lump sum or spread out over time. However, the contributions for a specific tax year cannot be made before the tax year begins or after the taxpayer's original filing date (without extensions) for that tax year. For most individuals, this is the earlier of April 15 of the following year or the date a return is filed. This is similar to the rules for IRA contributions.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJack and Eva, a married couple, retired last year when they each reached age 56. They purchased a family medical expense policy with a $5,000 deductible, and Jack established an HSA. The maximum contribution to the HSA for 2012 is $7,250, which consists of the regular $6,250 limit and an additional catch-up amount of $1,000 for Jack.\n\n\tHowever, i\u00a3 they each established an HSA, they both would be eligible to make the $1,000 catch-up contribution to their own accounts. The$6,250 regular contribution could be allocated between the two accounts as they agree upon. The net effect is that the total HSA contributions would increase to $8,250.\n\n\tThey can make these contributions in one or more payments between January 1, 2012 and the date they file their 2012 tax return.\n\n\tIf an individual stops participating in an HSA during a tax year, the actual HSA contribution that can be deducted for the tax year is limited to 1/12 of the annual amount, as described previously, times the number of months that an individual is eligible for HSA participation. Until 2007, the same rule applied if an individual began participating in an HSA after January of the tax-year-only a proportionate contribution could be made. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act changed the rule as long as an individual is still eligible to participate in an HSA during the last month of a tax-year. In such a situation, the individual is allowed to make the full annual tax-deductible contribution for the year. However, if he or she fails to remain eligible for an HSA for at least 12 months thereafter (other than because of death or disability), the contribution for the prior year that is attributable to months when the account holder did not have an HSA is includible in gross income and subject to a 20 percent penalty tax.\n\n\tAn excess contribution occurs to the extent that contributions to an HSA exceed the tax-deductible limits or are made for an ineligible person. The account holder is subject to a 6 percent excise tax on excess contributions (including those made by an employer) for each year these contributions are in an account. This excise tax can be avoided if the excess amount and any net income attributable to the excess amount are removed from the HSA prior to the last day prescribed by law, (including extensions) for filing the account holder's income tax return. The net income attributable to the excess contributions is included in the account holder's gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is made.\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\tPaul, aged 55, is eligible for an HSA and has a self-only high-deductible policy. In January 2012, he made a contribution of $2,000 to the HSA. On July 1, Paul decided to cease being a self-employed freelance editor and become an employee of a magazine. He cancelled his previous medical expense policy and enrolled in his new employer's, which did not qualify as a high-deductible health plan. As a result, Paul's allowable HSA contribution for the year is only 6/12 of $3,000, or $1,500. He is now in the position of having made an excess contribution for the year. As long as he withdraws the other $500 plus any earnings on this amount before filing his 2012 tax return, he will avoid any adverse tax consequences.\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\tJane, aged 39, did just the opposite of Paul. She left her prior job with an employer and became a self-employed consultant. This occurred on November 1, 2012, when she dropped her former HMO coverage through the employer and purchased a high-deductible medical expense policy for herself and her son. She also established an HSA. She is eligible to make the full 2012 contribution of $6,250 and took it as a deduction on her 2012 tax return. However, if she does not continue to be covered under a high-deductible health plan through 2013, a portion of this amount will have to be included as taxable income for 2013.\n\nRoll-Over Contributions\n\n\tAn account balance from an Archer MSA can be rolled over to an HSA on a tax-free basis. Similarly, account balances from an existing HSA can be rolled over to a new HSA.\n\n\tThe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 also allows certain other types of tax-free rollovers in specific circumstances. For example, an account holder who establishes an HSA is allowed a one-time rollover of funds from an HRA or health FSA. The amount of the rollover, which is in addition to any regular contribution for the year, is limited to the lesser of the balance in such an account on (1) September 21, 2006, or (2) the date of the rollover. If the account holder does not remain eligible to participate in an HSA for at least one year after the rollover, the amount of the rollover is included in income for tax purposes and subject to a penalty tax. Finally, an account holder may make a one-time-only rollover from an IRA. The amount of the rollover is limited to the tax-deductible HSA contribution for the year and reduces any regular contribution allowed.\n\nEmployer Contributions\n\n\tMany persons with HDHPs have their coverage under an employer-provided plan, and their employer may make contributions to the HSAs of employees. Employer contributions belong to the employee and are nonforfeitable. The employer might make the maximum annual contribution as previously described. However, it is also possible that the employer contribution will contribute a lower amount. In this case, an employee can make any remaining allowable contribution.\n\n\tAn employer that contributes to HSAs is subject to a nondiscrimination rule that requires the employer to make comparable contributions for all employees who have HSAs. Failure to comply with this rule subjects the employer to an excise tax. However, full-time employees and part-time employees (those working fewer than 30 hours per week) are treated separately. The comparability rule generally requires that the employer contribute either the same dollar amount for each employee or the same percentage of each employee's deductible under the health plan. However, it is permissible for an employer to make larger contributions for nonhighly-compensated employees than for highly compensated employees.\n\nHSA Account Growth\n\n\tUnused amounts in an HSA accumulate on a tax-free basis and carry over to subsequent years without limit. The size of an HSA balance carried over from prior years has no effect on a current year's contribution.\n\nDistributions from an HSA\n\n\tAn individual can usually take distributions from an HSA at any time, but the trust or custodial document may put reasonable restrictions on both the frequency and minimum amount of distributions. Generally, accounts are set up so that they can be accessed with debit cards or checks written by the account holder as an alternative to actually filing for reimbursement. The amount of the distribution can be any part or all of the account balance. Subject to some exceptions, distributions of both contributions and earnings are excludible from an account holder's gross income if used to pay medical expenses of the account holder and the account holder's legal spouse and tax dependents as long as these expenses are not paid by other sources of insurance. There is no requirement that these family members be covered by a high-deductible health insurance plan. If both a husband and wife have HSAs, the reimbursement for any family can come from either or both HSAs but together cannot exceed the amount of the unreimbursed expense.\n\n\tFor the most part, the eligible medical expenses are the same ones that would be deductible, ignoring the 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income limitation (10 percent in 2013), if the account holder itemized his or her income tax deductions. Tax-free withdrawals are permitted for the purchase of COBRA continuation coverage or for the purchase of health coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation. They are also permitted for the purchase of long-term care insurance up to certain deductible limits. However, tax-free withdrawals are not otherwise permitted for the purchase of health insurance by persons under age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tEric has accumulated $6,000 in his HSA account during the last 3 years. Because hjs wife has medical expense coverage with her employer, Eric's high-deductible policy is for him only.\n\n\tIn February, Eric incurred his first medical expenses for the year when he severely sprained his wrist. He incurred $1,000 in medical expenses that were not covered under his policy because the $5,000 deductible had not been met. Eric can pay for these expenses with funds from his HSA.\n\n\tIn April, Eric had a routine eye examination that cost $120. This examination was not covered under his medical expense policy, but it qualifies as a medical expense for IRS purposes. Therefore, Eric can take a $120 tax-free distribution from his HSA.\n\n\tIn July, Eric's wife had a crown installed by her dentist. Her employer-provided health insurance paid only $600 of the dentist's bill. Eric can use his HSA to pay the remaining $400 because HSA funds can be used to pay unreimbursed medical expenses of an account holder's legal spouse. (Note that the IRS considers medical expenses to include charges for dental services.)\n\n\n\tEven though contributions cannot be made after an individual reaches age 65 and becomes a Medicare beneficiary, tax-free distributions can still be used for any future qualified medical expenses, which include premiums for original Medicare, Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare Advantage plans, and medical expense coverage under employer-sponsored plans. However, an account holder cannot use tax-free distributions to pay premiums for a Medicare supplement policy.\n\n\tFrom a financial planning standpoint, account holders may want to wait until after retirement or age 65 to take HSA distributions as long as they have the resources to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses prior to that time. This will allow their HSA balances to grow on a tax-favored basis for use in their older years when unreimbursed medical expenses may be higher and/or income may be lower.\n\n\tDistributions are permitted for other reasons, but they are subject to income taxation and possibly to a 20 percent penalty tax. However, the penalty tax does not apply in the case of distributions after an individual's death, disability, or the attainment of age 65.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKirby has a balance of $7,000 in his HSA. At age 67, he rediscovered his childhood sweetheart and fell madly in love. She agreed to marry him and he wants to give her a big diamond ring. Because she told Kirby that she would take care of him for life, he decided to cash in his HSA and apply the proceeds to purchase the ring. His tax accountant informed Kirby that this arrangement would not be a qualified medical expense. He can withdraw the funds without penalty because he is at least age 65, but the $7,000 must be included in his gross income for federal income tax purposes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\n\tFormer employees, including retirees, may continue HSAs that were established prior to termination of employment, and the rules for contributions and distributions are as previously described.\n\n\tRetirees who did not have an HSA prior to retirement can establish one at that time as long as all the proper rules are satisfied. Such an HSA may present an opportunity for a retiree to reduce income taxes. However, the requirement of having a high-deductible plan will probably negate this advantage if an individual has substantial medical expenses.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tKathleen, a widow, retired at age 60 from her job as an attorney. She likes the concept of consumer-directed health plans and has decided to establish an HSA. In order to be eligible for the HSA, she purchased a major medical policy with an annual deductible of $2,500. She plans to make the maximum allowable contribution to the HSA until she is eligible for Medicare. She will then use her HSA balance to pay her Medicare premiums.\n\n\tThere are fees involved in establishing an HSA. These fees may affect any potential tax advantages if an HSA is established near the time of Medicare enrollment.\n\nEstate Tax Treatment of HSAs\n\n\tUpon death, the remaining balance in an HSA is includible in the account holder's gross estate for estate tax purposes. If the beneficiary of the account is a surviving spouse, the HSA belongs to the spouse and he or she can deduct the account balance in determining the account holder's taxable estate. The surviving spouse can then use the HSA for his or her medical expenses. If the beneficiary is someone other than the spouse, the HSA ceases to exist, and the beneficiary must include the fair market value of the account in his or her gross income for tax purposes. If no beneficiary is named, the tax is payable by the estate or the beneficiary of the estate.\n\nEstablishing and Maintaining HSAs\n\n\tThere are a number of issues that need to be evaluated by an individual who has the option to establish an HSA. Perhaps the most important question is whether such an account is appropriate. After a person decides to establish an HSA, issues such as account fees, investment options for funds, and record keeping must be addressed.\n\nAppropriateness of HSAs\n\n\tFor some persons, an HSA is very appropriate and offers significant tax benefits and financial planning opportunities. For other persons, an HSA may not be an attractive financial commitment. An HSA's viability depends on individual circumstances such as income, tax rates, the funds available to fund such an account, when account balance will be withdrawn, earnings on account funds, and account fees. Some of these issues are addressed in the following example.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tJohn and his wife, both aged 50, no longer have any dependent children. They are self-employed and have a joint income of $150,000. For the last few years, they have had an HSA-compatible policy with a $5,000 deductible, but have not established HSAs. They are in good health and have paid aU unreimbursed medical expenses from current income. Their financial advisor has suggested that one or both of them should establish an HSA. They have decided to do so, and make an annual contribution of $5,000, which is an affordable financial commitment. This will result in an annual income tax savings of $1,300 (based on IRS estimates). They have also decided to continue paying any unreimbursed medical expenses from current income and to let the HSA funds accumulate until they retire at age 65. They plan on investing the funds and expect them to grow at about 5 percent per year. If this return is achieved, they will have a fund of about $100,000 when they retire. They will then withdraw amounts as needed on a tax-free basis to pay their Medicare premiums.\n\nAccount Fees\n\n\tOne factor that varies widely among financial institutions that offer HSAs is the fees that they charge. If an individual uses an HSA that has been established by his or her employer, the employer may pay some of these fees. But no matter how an account is established, a potential account holder should look at the fees and their impact on the account balance. Unfortunately, this is not always easy to do. Although financial institutions often have information about their HSAs on Web sites or in print, the fee structure is often conspicuously absent or hard to locate. Unlike other types of financial products, such as IRAs, there are no requirements to provide potential account holders with\na prospectus that details the fees. Therefore, it is often necessary to ask specific questions. As the next example demonstrates, these fees may have an effect on the decision to establish an HSA. Even if an HSA is an obvious choice, the account balance will be affected by the fee structure.\n\n\tHSA fees fall into several categories that might include one or more of the following:\n\n\t\t\u2022 account setup fee. This is a one-time fee to establish the HSA. Such fees typically range from $0 to $50, with $15 or $20 being common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 annual fee. An HSA may have an annual fee that ranges up to $200, but amounts of $10 to $20 are most common.\n\n\t\t\u2022 monthly maintenance fee. An HSA may have a monthly maintenance fee that ranges up to $10, but amounts like $2 to $3 seem most common. Although there may be both a monthly maintenance fee and an annual fee, this is very uncommon; there is usually one or the other. In either case, the amount of the fee may be lower for higher account balances.\n\n\t\t\u2022 transaction fee. An HSA may have a fee that is levied on each transaction. The fee may apply to contributions, but is most likely to be levied on withdrawals only. Fees may be as high as $5, but $.25 to $.50 are quite common. Sometimes a few transactions are allowed without a fee, but fees are levied on transactions in excess of this number.\n\n\t\t\u2022 account closing fee. It is not unusual for an HSA to have an account closing fee that can range up to $25 or $30, although $10 is a more common amount.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\tAmber is an administrative assistant who earns about $40,000 annually. She has an employer-provided medical expense policy with a $2,500 deductible. Her employer has not set up HSAs for employees and makes no HSA contributions. Amber enjoys traveling and what money she has left is being saved for a new car that she hopes to buy within the next 2 years. Amber is healthy and incurs about $500 in unreimbursed medical expenses annually. This typically includes two doctor's visits and quarterly refills of a prescription drug. To minimize her taxes, Amber decides toestablish an HSA. She plans on putting the $500 into an HSA account and taking a withdrawal each time she incurs an unreimbursed medical expense. This will lower her taxes by about $75. When she looks into establishing such an account with her local bank, she finds that they have an account setup fee of $15. There is also a $2 monthly maintenance fee ($24 per year) and a $3 fee for each withdrawal ($18 for her six transactions). Therefore, she will incur expenses of $57 to save $75 the first year. When Amber finds out that her account balance will be too small to earn more than 1 percent interest, she decides that an HSA is not worth the administrative hassle for such a minimal tax savings.\n\nInvestment Options for HSA Funds\n\n\tFinancial institutions often offer several types of investment options for HSA funds. Account holders can invest HSA funds in essentially the same manner as IRA funds. Allowable investments include bank accounts, annuities, certificates of deposit, stocks, mutual funds, and bonds. Investments in life insurance policies or most types of collectibles are prohibited. In addition, an HSA trust or custodial agreement may limit the investment options available.\n\n\tAlthough mutual funds and stocks may result in the best return over a number of years, they are probably unsuitable if an account holder has modest amounts in an HSA that will be used for medical expenses in the near future. Like many types of investments, they will fluctuate in value over time. Such investments may also be unavailable unless an account holder has an account balance of several thousand dollars. The prior example regarding John under the heading Appropriateness shows when such an investment makes sense.\n\n\tIn most cases, an individual will be using some type of bank account that allows easy access to the available funds. In this case, it is important to evaluate the return that these funds will earn, which is set by each bank. In some cases, nothing is paid unless the account exceeds a minimum balance, such as $1,000. Interest rates may also vary by the size of the account's average daily balance. In still other cases, a specified interest rate, which can change, is paid on any size balance. Even with these variations, there are significant differences among banks.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\n\tCustodians and trustees for HSAs report the amount of annual contributions to and distributions from each HSA to the IRS. Under IRS rules, it is the account holder's responsibility to determine whether distributions from HSAs are for eligible medical expenses. Therefore, individuals who establish such accounts should maintain records in case they are audited. They should also become familiar with the types of expenses that are deductible. Guidance can be found in IRS Publication 502, which is available on the IRS Web site: irs.gov."

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? \n\n\tA medical Flexible Spending Account (also known as a flexible spending arrangement or FSA) is a special account that an employee can put pre-tax money into to pay for certain out-of\u00adpocket health care costs not covered by insurance. Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2200 - Flexible Spending Accounts - Flexible Spending Accounts Defined\n\nFlexible spending accounts (FSAs) have become a large part of the cafeteria plan picture.\n\nPointer: FAS/' FACJ'S about flexible spending accounts\n\nFSAs can be used to \"pre-fund\" health care or dependent care expenses in pre-tax dollars. Generally, an employee is not entitled to recover any unused amounts in the FSA at the end of the year, however.\n\nA health care FSA cannot be used to pay for other health care insurance premiums.\n\nDependent care assistance FSAs are limited to $5,000 per year. In 2020, the maximum limit on salary reduction contributions to health care FSAs is $2,750.\n \nUse of FSAs\n\n\tAn FSA provides an account in an employee's name that is used to reimburse the employee for certain personal expenses (see KB-1 Topic 2250). They are provided by employers as a way for employees to pre-fund dependent care, medical, or dental expenses in pre-tax dollars (see KB-1 Topic 2210). Health care spending accounts (see KB-1 Topic 2215) and dependent care spending accounts (see KB-1 Topic 2270) are subject to special rules and limits.\n\n\tEnrollment form. An employee wishing to participate in an FSA must\ncomplete an enrollment form. Amounts placed into the FSA are deducted from the employee's paycheck (see KB-1 Topic 2265).\n\n\tTax treatment If the FSA is \"forfeitable\" (that is, if the employee does not have the right to receive any of the unused amounts left in the account at the end of the year), the reimbursements made through the account are excluded from the employee's taxable income (see KB-1 Topic 2240).\n\nPointer: IRS proposed regulations relate to the administration of cafeteria plans and the benefits that can be offered as a part of a cafeteria plan as well as flexible spending accounts (FSAs). The proposed regulations incorporate changes made by legislation since previous proposed regulations were drafted. The regulations also consolidate and withdraw prior proposed regulations. The rules contained in the proposed regulations are substantially unchanged from the withdrawn proposed regulations, with only minor changes to reflect legislation and for clarification. The withdrawn proposed regulations were organized in question-and-answer format, but the current proposed regulations have abandoned that format. The proposed regulations may be relied on for guidance pending the issuance of final regulations.\n\nProp. Reg. \u00a71.125-5 contains the rules for the inclusion of an FSA in a cafeteria plan. The regulations retair1 the uniform coverage and use-or-lose rules and include the general requirements of a qualified FSA plan. The proposed rules also retain the forfeiture allocation rules in the prior proposed regulations and clarify that the employer sponsoring the cafeteria plan may retain forfeitures, use forfeitures to defray expenses of administering the plan or allocate forfeitures among employees contributing through salary reduction on a reasonable and uniform basis.\n\n\tLevels of coverage. A single FSA may provide participants with different levels of coverage and different maximum amounts of reimbursements.\n\nExample 1: An employer with 1,000 employees maintains a cafeteria plan under which the employees may elect several benefit options, including insured health plans and HMOs. The plan provides that the required premiums or contributions for the benefits are to be made by salary reduction. Even though the plan may characterize employees' premium payments and other contributions as flexible spending contributions or credits, the operation of a cafeteria plan to permit employees' contributions to be made on a salary reduction basis does not, standing alone, cause the plan (or any benefit thereunder) to be treated as an FSA.\n \nExample 2: An employer with 1,000 employees maintains a cafeteria plan under which the employees may elect, among other benefits, a level of coverage under an arrangement that will reimburse medical expenses incurred during a year up to the specified amount elected by the employee. The maximum amount of reimbursement that can be deducted for a year is $2,750. Because each employee's premium for such coverage is equal to the maximum reimbursement amount selected by the employee, this arrangement is a health FSA.\n\nReimbursements for transit expenses\n\n\tThe IRS has approved final regulations governing reimbursement accounts that cover certain employee transportation expenses. These reimbursements must be\u2022 made under a \"bona fide reimbursement arrangement.\" The arrangements resemble FSAs in the way that the benefits may be provided under compensation reduction arrangements and the employee must provide proof that he or she incurred the expense prior to receiving reimbursement of the expense (Reference 1 below). These reimbursement accounts constitute qualified transportation fringe benefits under Code Sec. 132 and should 'not be confused with health FSAs or dependent care FSAs under Code Sec. 125.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFor a discussion of tax treatment of flexible spending accounts, see KB-1 Topic 2285.\n\nFor a discussion of qualified transportation fringe benefits, see KB-1 Topic 3350.\n\nFor more information, see KB-1 Topic 39,150 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n\n1 IRS Reg. \u00a7\u00a71.132-5 and 1.132-9.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2215 - Health Care Spending Accounts\n\tGenerally, a health care flexible spending account (FSA) is designed to pay an employee's medical and dental expenses in pre-tax dollars. The annual deductibles for the medical and dental portions of the employer-provided health care plan, as well as expenses not covered by the plan (e.g., eye examinations, glasses, hearing aids, and orthodontia), can be reimbursed from the health care FSA\n\t2020 annual limits. Effective for tax years beginning in 2020, a health FSA will not be a qualified benefit under a cafeteria plan unless the plan provides for a $2,750 maximum salary reduction contribution to the FSA. (Reference 1 below) If the plan does allow salary reductions in excess of $2,750, then an employee will be subject to tax on distributions from the health FSA, thereby eliminating any of the tax benefits of health FSA contributions. Indexing of the annual limit applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 2013. The IRS has clarified that the term \"taxable year\" refers to the plan year of the cafeteria plan as this is the period for which salary\u00ad reduction elections are made. Furthermore, in the case of a plan providing a grace period (which may be up to two months and 15 days), unused salary-reduction contributions to the health FSA for plan years beginning in 2012 or later that are carried over into the grace period for that plan year will not count against the annual limit for the subsequent plan year. The IRS has also provided relief for certain salary-reduction contributions exceeding the annual limit that are due to a reasonable mistake and not willful neglect and that are corrected by the employer. (Reference 2 below)\n\tBenefits provided under health care FSAs are treated as \"excepted benefits\" under HIPAA-see KB-1 Topic 2226.\n\nPremiums for other health coverage\n\tA health care spending account cannot be used to pay the premiums for other health care coverage, such as an individual health plan premium, Medicare premiums, or group health insurance premiums incurred by the employee's spouse. (Reference 3 below)\n\tPointer: Although health care FSAs cannot be used to pay premiums for other health care coverage, premiums for current health plan coverage (including coverage under a health care FSA) may still be paid on a salary reduction basis through the ordinary operation of the cafeteria plan.\n\nFSA insurance features\n\tFSAs are required to incorporate features that are commonly associated with insurance arrangements, such as basic risk-shifting and risk-spreading characteristics. (Reference 4 below)\n\nReimbursement for incurred medical expenses\nReimbursements under health care FSAs must be paid specifically to reimburse the participant for medical expenses incurred previously during the period of coverage. (Reference 5 below) A health care FSA cannot operate under a cafeteria plan in a manner that enables participants to receive coverage only for periods for which the participants expect to incur medical expenses if such periods constitute less than a plan year.\n\tA reimbursement is not paid specifically to reimburse the participant for medical expenses if the participant is entitled to these amounts in the form of cash or any other taxable or nontaxable benefit, including health care coverage for an additional period, without regard to whether the employee incurs medical expenses during the period. A health care FSA cannot qualify for tax-favored treatment if the effect of the reimbursement arrangement eliminates all, or substantially all, risk of loss to the employer maintaining the plan or to the other insurer.\n\tPointer: Employers may wish to keep FSA participants informed of reimbursed expenses and account balances by issuing FSA status memos. This memo could also be used to remind participants of the deadline for submitting claims for the current year.\n \nAvailability of maximum reimbursement\n\tThe maximum amount of reimbursement elected by each participant must be available to the participant throughout the coverage period, subject to reduction for prior claims paid. (Reference 6 below) The amount of the available reimbursement cannot be based on the amount of premiums paid by the individual at the time the claim is made, nor can an employer accelerate the premium payment schedule based upon claims.\n\tReimbursement will be deemed to be available at all times: (Reference 7 below)\n\t1. if it is paid at least monthly; or\n\t2. when the total amount of the claims submitted is at least a specified minimum amount (e.g., $50).\n\tIf the employee revokes existing elections, the employer must reimburse the employee for any amount previously paid for coverage or benefits relating to the period after the date of the employee's separation from service, regardless of the employee's claims or reimbursements as of such date. (Reference 8 below)\n\tExample 1: Employee Arnold Carter elects coverage under a health care FSA providing coverage of up to $300 in medical expenses, and the annual premium for a calendar year of coverage is $300. Arnold is permitted to pay the $300 premium through salary reductions of $25 per month throughout the coverage period. He must be eligible to receive the maximum amount of reimbursement of $300 at all times throughout the coverage period (reduced by prior reimbursements).\n\tThus, if Arnold incurs $250 of medical expenses in January, the full $250 must be available for reimbursement even though he has made only one premium payment. If Arnold incurs another $50 in health expenses in February, the remaining $50 of the $300 maximum must be available for reimbursement. The employer or plan may not provide for an acceleration of the required premium payments based on Arnold's incurred claims and reimbursements.\n\tExample 2: Employee Ernie Brock elects coverage under a health care FSA with a maximum reimbursement limit of $500 for a calendar year of coverage and is required to pay the $450 premium for such coverage in two equal $225 installments, one at the beginning of the period of coverage and the second installment by the beginning of the sixth month of coverage. Ernie incurs a\n$400 medical expense in February, and the FSA makes a $400 reimbursement to the employee in March. Ernie does not incur any additional medical expenses before the end of June, at which time he separates from service.\n\tIf Ernie fails to make the second premium installment, his coverage under the FSA may be terminated as of the end of June so that medical expenses incurred after June are not covered. If Ernie pays the second premium installment, his coverage under the FSA must continue, so that additional medical expenses (up to the remaining $100) incurred before the end of December are covered.\n \nTwelve-month period of coverage\n\tA health care FSA must provide coverage for a period of 12 months, although there are exceptions for short first plan years or short plan years when the entire cafeteria plan year is being changed. (Reference 9 below) Election changes to increase or decrease the level of coverage under a health care FSA during the 12-month period of coverage are not permitted. However, a cafeteria plan may permit participants to make health care FSA election changes if there is a change in the employee's status(see KB-1 Topic 2070).\n\tEmployees who make the total premium payment for the 12-month period cannot be terminated from the health care FSA merely because they separate from service with the employer. (Reference 10 below)\n\tExample 3: Ellen Nelson has elected a $300 calendar year health care FSA, with monthly premium payments of $25 during the 12-month period of cover\u00ad age. She separates from the service of her employer at the end of June and ceases to make additional premium payments. The cafeteria plan may provide that the FSA's period of coverage does not extend beyond June if she does not continue to make the required premium payments. However, if Ellen makes the total premium payment for the 12-month period of coverage, the cafeteria plan may not terminate the FSA's period of coverage merely because she separated from service before the end of the coverage period.\n\nProhibited reimbursements\n\tReimbursements under health care FSAs must be paid specifically to reimburse medical expenses incurred during the coverage period. A health care FSA cannot reimburse participants for premiums for other health coverage. This includes premiums paid for health coverage maintained by the employer of the employee's spouse or dependent. (Reference 11 below) A health care FSA cannot reimburse partici\u00ad pants for expenses incurred for cosmetic surgery except in certain circumstances\n(see KB-1 Topic 2250).

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-3 - Group Health Insurance - What is an Indemnity or \u201cfee-for-service\u201d plan and how does it work?\n \n                       Fee-for-service plans, also known as indemnity plans, are traditional insurance plans that allow employees to chose any physician or medical facility they want to use. In return, the insurer requires employees to pay a deductible amount each year before coverage kicks in. Once the deductible has been met, the insurance company will pay the majority of each bill (usually 70 to 80 percent), and the employee pays the remainder (the co\u00adinsurance charge) of 20 to 30 percent.\n\n                       Fee-for-service plans have been largely replaced by HMOs and PPOs. Indemnity plans give participants complete freedom to chose their providers, but that means that there is no network and no negotiated fee structure, so premiums are higher than with other types of health care plans. As a result, younger, healthier employees tend to move to HMOs and PPOs, causing indemnity plan premiums to increase even more as the number of participants decreases."

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 515 - Health Benefits - Health Plan Administration - Benefit Denial Procedures\n\n   There are many reasons why a claim might be denied. For example, the services may not be covered by the benefit plan. Another common reason for denial is that the treatment is experimental. The plan maximum benefit level may have been reached. The individual may not be eligible under the plan because he or she has not worked for the employer for the required number of days. Denial can also occur when the claimant has a preexisting condition that precludes coverage until a specified exclusion period has passed.\n   If a claim is denied. When a claim is denied, the plan administrator must provide the claimant with the reasons for denial in easy-to-understand language. The plan administrator must explain the information needed to perfect the claim, cite the plan provisions on which the denial was based, and detail the procedure for appealing the claim decision (Reference 1 below).\n   Ultimately, a participant may initiate a lawsuit to decide whether the plan should pay a claim. Depending on the amount of discretion accorded the administrator in interpreting a claim, the court could decide whether the denial of benefits constituted an abuse of discretion or review the facts de novo and make a decision on coverage (see KB-1 Topic 55).\n   For a detailed discussion of the benefit claims procedure, see KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nSupreme Court decisions\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that ERISA did not preempt an Illinois law allowing for an independent external review to resolve disputes over the \"medical necessity\" of medical treatments that a patient's primary care doctor has recommended (Reference 3 below). The end result of the Court's decision is that state independent review laws will control, as long as they don't create a new cause of action or provide a remedy beyond the benefits otherwise available under a plan.\n   The Supreme Court also has held that a Texas state law, the Texas Health Care Liability Act (fHCLA), was preempted by ERISA where two HMO participants sought recovery under the THCLA for their HMOs' refusal to provide certain treatment and services recommended by their doctors. The claims were only to rectify wrongful benefits denials; they did not arise independently of ERISA or the plans' terms. Because the claims were pure eligibility decisions, ERISA, not state law, provided the exclusive remedy (Reference 4 below).\n \nInterpretation of eligible expenses\n   In the process of paying or denying a claim, the administrator should differentiate expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from those that are not allowed under the plan. While many employers adopt many of the same plan provisions and follow state or federal laws that apply to the plans, each employer does have discretion in designing the welfare benefit plan that it offers to employees. Therefore, the claim payer must be able to identify each employer's plan and the specific provisions of the plan to identify eligible expenses.\n   Just because a charge is eligible for payment does not mean that the plan will reimburse for it. Charges that are not allowed should neither be reimbursed nor applied toward satisfaction of the deductible.\n   Pointer: The plan document should specify and define noncovered expenses so that the administrator, utilization reviewers, the employer, and participants can all clearly understand types of charges that the plan will not allow.\n   Payments that were wrongfully made by an administrator may be recovered under ERISA and claims fraudulently submitted may be denied payment.\n\nFor more information...\n   Claim procedure requirements under ERISA are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n   An ERISA-required review after a benefit denial is analyzed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n   Claim procedure requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are discussed at KB-1 Topic 934.\n\nFor more information ...\n   A discussion of possible reasons for denial of a medical claim is located at KB-1 Topic 10,425 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f) and (g).\n3 Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

                    "text": "KB-1- KB-1 Topic 934 - Health Care Reform - Reporting Rules - Reporting Rules - Claims Appeals Process\n\tThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) added new claims appeals requirements. In addition to complying with the rules in effect prior to the law's passage, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims, including an internal claims appeal process and employee notification. (Reference 1 below)\n\tAppeals process under the ACA. For plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, group health plans and health insurers must implement an effective process for appeals of coverage determinations and claims. This appeals process must include, at a minimum, the following:\n\t\u25a1 an established internal claims appeal process;\n\t\u25a1 a notice to participants, in a \"culturally and linguistically appropriate manner,\" of available internal and external appeals processes, including the availability of an office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman to assist with the appeals processes; and\n\t\u25a1 a provision allowing an enrollee to review his or her file, to present evidence and testimony as part of the appeals process, and to receive continued coverage during the appeals process. (Reference 2 below)\n\tInternal review requirements. Plans must adhere to new requirements, in addition to those found in the existing Department of Labor (DOL) claims procedure regulation, in order to implement the \"effective\" internal claims and appeals process required under the ACA. (Reference 3 below)\n\tAdverse benefit determination. The definition of an adverse benefit determination is broader than the definition in the DOL claims procedure regulation, in that an adverse benefit determination for purposes of the final regulations also includes a rescission of coverage. (Reference 4 below) An adverse benefit determination eligible for internal claims and appeals processes under the regulations includes a denial of, reduction of, termination of, or failure to provide or make a payment for a benefit, including the following:\n\t1. a determination of an individual's eligibility to participate in a plan or health insurance coverage;\n\t2. a determination that a benefit is not a covered benefit;\n\t3. the imposition of a preexisting condition exclusion, source-of-injury exclusion, network exclusion, or other limitation on otherwise covered benefits; or\n\t4. a determination that a benefit is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary or appropriate.\n\t72-hour notice. For urgent care claims (as defined in existing DOL claims procedure regulations), the regulations provide that a plan must notify a claimant of a benefit determination (whether adverse or not) as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after the receipt of the claim by the plan or health insurance coverage, unless the claimant fails to provide sufficient information to determine whether benefits are covered or payable. Plans and issuers are allowed to follow the original rule in the DOL claims procedure regulation (requiring decision-making in the context of pre-service urgent care claims as soon as possible, but in no event later than 72 hours, consistent with the medical exigencies involved), provided that the plan or issuer defers to the attending provider with respect to the decision as to whether a claim constitutes \"urgent care.\"\n\tFull and fair review. Final regulations provide additional criteria to ensure that a claimant receives a full and fair review. In addition to complying with the requirements of the existing DOL claims procedure regulation, a plan must provide the claimant, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered by the plan in connection with the claim. Such evidence must be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the notice of adverse benefit determination on review is required to be provided to give the claimant a reasonable opportunity to respond. Also, before the plan can issue an adverse benefit determination based on a new or additional rationale, the claimant must be provided, free of charge, with the rationale. The rationale also must be provided as soon as possible and sufficiently in advance of the date on which the notice of adverse benefit determination on review is required. (Reference 5 below)\n\tConflict of interest Criteria are provided with respect to avoiding conflicts of interest. The plan or issuer must ensure that all claims and appeals are adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the persons involved in malting the decision. Thus, decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or other similar matters must not be made based upon the likelihood that the individual will support a denial of benefits. For example, a plan or issuer cannot provide bonuses based on the number of denials made by a claims adjudicator. Similarly, a plan or issuer cannot contract with a medical expert based on the expert's reputation for outcomes in contested cases, rather than based on the expert's professional qualifications. (Reference 6 below)\n\t\"Culturally appropriate. \"The ACA and regulations require a plan to provide a notice to enrollees \"in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner.\" This provision applies to internal and external claims appeals processes. Plans and issuers are considered to provide relevant notices in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner if notices are provided in a non-English language based on thresholds of the number of people who are literate in the same non-English language. (Reference 7 below)\n\tIn the group market, the threshold differs depending on the number of participants in the plan. For a plan that covers fewer than 100 participants, the threshold is 25% of participants being literate only in the same non-English language. For a plan that covers 100 or more participants at the beginning of a plan year, the threshold is the lesser of 500 participants, or 10% of all plan participants. If an applicable threshold is met, the plan and issuer must also:\n\t\u25a1 include a statement in the English versions of all notices, prominently displayed in the non-English language, offering the provision of such no\u00ad tices in the non-English language;\n\t\u25a1 once a request has been made by a claimant, provide all subsequent notices to the claimant in the non-English language; and\n\t\u25a1 to the extent the plan or issuer maintains a customer assistance process (such as a telephone hotline) that answers questions or provides assistance with filing claims and appeals, the plan or issuer must provide such assistance in the non-English language. (Reference 8 below)\n\tIn addition, a plan must ensure that any notice of adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination includes information sufficient to identify the claim involved. This includes the date of service, the health care provider, and the claim amount (if applicable). Additionally, the plan or issuer must provide a description of available internal appeals and external review processes, including information regarding how to initiate an appeal. Finally, the plan or issuer must disclose the availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman to assist enrollees with the internal claims and appeals and external review processes. HHS eliminated the requirement to automatically provide the diagnosis and treatment codes as part of a notice of adverse benefit determination (or final internal adverse benefit determination) and instead substituted a requirement that the plan or issuer must provide notification of the opportunity to request the diagnosis and treatment codes in all notices of adverse benefit determination (and notices of final internal adverse benefit determination); and a requirement to provide this information upon request. (Reference 9 below)\n\tFailure to comply. If a plan fails to strictly adhere to all the requirements of the internal claims and appeals process, the claimant is deemed to have exhausted the internal claims and appeals process, regardless of whether the plan or issuer asserts that it substantially complied with these requirements or that any error it committed was de minimis. Upon such a such a failure, the claimant may initiate an external review and pursue any available remedies under applicable law, such as judicial review. (Reference 10 below)\n\tNevertheless, the internal claims and appeals process will not be deemed exhausted based on de minimis violations that do not cause, and are not likely to cause, prejudice or harm to the claimant so long as the plan or issuer demonstrates that the violation was for good cause or due to matters beyond the control of the plan or issuer and that the violation occurred in the context of an ongoing, good faith exchange of information between the plan and the claimant.\n\tOptions for external reviews. Group health plans and insurers have two options regarding the implementation of external reviews:\n\t1. Plans and insurers must comply with state external review requirements that are binding and at a minimum include the consumer protections in the Uniform External Review Model Act from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC); or\n\t2. If state requirements do not meet the minimums or if the plan is self\u00ad funded and not subject to state insurance regulations, then the plan must implement an external review process that is similar to that in the Uniform External Review Model Act and that meets standards established by the Department of Health and Human Services. (Reference 11 below)\n\tInterim final regulations provide a basis for determining when plans must comply with a state external review process and when they must comply with the federal external review process.\n\tState external review process. For health insurance coverage, if a state external review process includes, at a minimum, the consumer protections in the NAIC Uniform Model Act in place on July 23, 2010, then the issuer must comply with the applicable state external review process and not with the federal external review process. In such a case, to the extent that benefits under a group health plan are provided through health insurance coverage, the issuer is required to satisfy the obligation to provide an external review process, so the plan itself is not required to comply with either the state external review process or the federal external review process.

(Reference 1 below)\n\nStandards of review\n\tIn reviewing a benefit denial under ERISA's civil enforcement standards, a court can consider the case anew from the beginning on its merits in what is called de novo review.\n\tHowever, where a plan gives the administrator or fiduciary the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan, a court needs only to determine whether the actions of the plan administrator were arbitrary and capricious.(Reference 2 below)\n\t\nSupreme Court rejection of deference exceptions. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that where a company's plan provisions gave the plan administrator the power to construe disputed terms, a federal district court should have deferred to the administrator's reasonable interpretation of disputed provisions.(Reference 3 below)\n\nArbitrary and capricious standard\nIn determining whether a fiduciary's actions were arbitrary and capricious, courts generally have considered whether\n\t1. the fiduciary acted rationally or reasonably;\n\t2. there was fraud or bad faith;\n\t3. there was a consistent application of the terms of the plan or ERISA; or\n\t4. the fiduciary's actions were based on substantial evidence.\n\nPointer: The provision of adequate notice prior to a fiduciary's exercise of discretionary authority might be considered relevant to a determination of arbitrariness.\nAn employee benefit plan that gave different reasons for denying benefits to a plan beneficiary at each stage of review failed to comply with requirements under ERISA.(Reference 4 below) The court found that the plan's denial had been arbitrary and capricious.\n\nReview of conflict-of-interest cases\n\tA plan administrator that both evaluates and pays benefits claims operates under a conflict of interest in making discretionai:y benefit determinations, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled.(Refernce 5 below)\n\tThe conflict does not change the standard of review of a benefits denial from deferential to de novo, but the conflict should be weighed as a factor in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. \n\tA conflict of interest should prove more important where there is a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, such as where an insurance company administrator has a histoi:y of biased claims administration. \n\tThe conflict would prove less important, the court explained, where an administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy.\n\nFor more information ...\nThe standards of judicial review following a denial of benefits are discussed in greater detail at KB-1 Topic 130,090 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\nCivil enforcement under ERISA is discussed at KB-1 Topic 55.\n\nREFERENCE\n\n1 Kinkead v.

In most cases, an administrative system would do the following:\n1. the patient's participation and eligibility are checked-for ex\u00ad ample, has the employee met any eligibility waiting periods.\n2. secondary coverage, if any, is identified and coordination of benefit procedures is initiated.\n3. if called for, medical services performed are checked for appropriateness and eligibility-for example, have any preexisting condition restrictions been overridden.\n4. medical fees are screened for compliance with the plan's established usual and customary limits for that type of service-for example, is the doctor charging too much for an office visit given the guidelines of the plan.\n5. contracts with the providers are examined to determine whether discounts apply.\n6. files are checked to make sure the patient and the family have met deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums and coinsurance levels are noted.\n7. proper contact with a utilization manager or EAP is substantiated (if required for the service).\n8. plan provisions are consulted to determine the appropriate reimbursement level.\n9. extracontractual arrangements are certified to determine whether exceptions to the written rules have been approved.\n10. the benefit payment is calculated.\n11. authorization to issue a check is given and reimbursement is transmitted to the covered person or to the assigned provider; and\n12. a verification might also be made to see whether charges that are not reimbursed by the plan are eligible for payment from a flexible spending account, if any (see KB-1 Topic 2200).\n   If a claim does not \"pass\" all the steps and is denied, the plan administrator must notify the claimant (see KB-1 Topic 515).\n \nFor more information...\n   A discussion on medical claims data and other KB-1 Topics relating to the payment of medical claims is at KB-1 Topic 10,405 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n"

Health plans or health insurers are not, however, required to cover a child of the adult child receiving dependent coverage (Reference 1 below).\n    In a separate change made by the ACA, the tax exclusion for employer\u00adprovided health benefits has been extended to include an adult child \"who as of the end of the taxable year has not attained age 27\" (also see KB-1 Topic 956) (Reference 2 below).\n    A child includes a son, daughter, stepchild, adopted child, or eligible foster child (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: The exclusion applies only for reimbursements for medical care of individuals who are not age 27 or older at any time during the taxable year. For example, a child born on Dec. 10, 1992, attains age 27 on Dec. 10, 2019. For this individual, the tax exclusion is available only through 2018. Employers may rely on the employee's representation as to the child's date of birth (Reference 4 below).\n    Restrictions on plan definition of dependent. Group health plans may not use student status, residency, or financial support from a parent to deny or restrict dependent coverage to children (Reference 5 below). Examples of factors that cannot be used for defining dependent for purposes of eligibility (or continued eligibility) include:\n\u2022 financial dependency on the participant or primary subscriber (or any other person),\n\u2022 residency with the participant or primary subscriber (or any other person),\n\u2022 student status,\n\u2022 employment,\n\u2022 eligibility for other coverage,\n\u2022 living, working or residing in an HMO's service area or other network service area (for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017);\n\u2022 marital status, or\n\u2022 any combination of these factors.\n    Example: A group health plan offers a choice of self-only or family health coverage. Dependent coverage is provided under family health coverage for children of participants who have not attained age 26. The plan imposes an additional premium surcharge for children who are older than age 18.\n    The plan violates the age rule because the plan varies the terms for dependent coverage of children based on age.\n    The age rule does not prohibit distinctions based upon age that apply to all coverages under the plan, including coverage for employees and spouses as well as dependent children.\n    Example: A group health plan normally charges a copayment for physician visits that do not constitute preventive services. The plan charges this copayment to individuals age 19 and over, including employees, spouses, and dependent children, but waives it for those under age 19 (Reference 6 below).\n    The copayments charged to dependent children are the same as those charged to employees and spouses. Accordingly, the arrangement does not violate the age rule (Reference 7 below).\n    Effects on Code Sec. 125 plans and HRAs. Code Sec. 125 cafeteria plan regulations currently do not permit election changes for children younger than age 27 who are not the employee's dependents. The IRS intends to amend IRS Reg. \u00a7 1.125-4, effective retroactively to March 30, 2010, to include change-in-status events affecting nondependent children younger than age 27, including becoming newly eligible for coverage or eligible for coverage beyond the date on which the child otherwise would have lost coverage (Reference 8 below).\n    The same rules for an employee's child younger than age 27 apply to a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA), an arrangement that is paid for solely by an employer (not through a Code Sec. 125 plan) and which reimburses an employee for medical care expenses up to a maximum dollar amount for a coverage period.\n    VEBAs, Sec. 401(h) accounts, and Code Sec. 162(1) deductions. The same general rules for providing a tax exclusion to children younger than age 27 also apply to the following provisions (Reference 9 below):\n\u2022 voluntary employee beneficiary associations (VEBAs) providing for the payment of sick and accident benefits to members;\n\u2022 Code Sec. 401(h) accounts that provide for the payment of benefits for sickness, accident, hospitalization, and medical expenses; and\n\u2022 Code Sec. 162(1), which allows self-employed individuals to deduct amounts paid during the taxable year for insurance that constitutes medical care.\n    Retiree-only plan or excepted benefits. The health reform provisions extending health coverage to adult children under age 26 do not apply to retiree-only plans or excepted benefits. Excepted benefits generally include dental-only and vision-only plans, most health flexible spending arrangements, Medigap policies, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage (Reference 10 below).\n    Comment: HSA distributions for covered dependents. Because the ACA did not amend Code Sec. 223, which governs HSAs, it appears that HSAs cannot reimburse medical expenses for adult children on a tax-free basis unless the child otherwise qualifies as a tax dependent of the account holder (in other words, the law before health reform). Any HSA reimbursements for medical expenses of adult children would be treated as nonqualified reimbursements subject to income inclusion and penalties, which increased from 10% to 20% in 2011.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nl PHSA \u00a7 2714.\t\t\n2 Code Sec. 105(b).\n3 Code Sec. 152(f).\t\t\n4 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n5 Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2714(b).\n6 Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2714(e).\n7 FAQs About the Affordable Care Act Implementation Part V, http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq\u00adaca5.html.\n8 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n9 IRS Notice 2010-38, I.R.B. 2010-20, May 17, 2010.\n10 Preamble to regulations issued jointly by EBSA, IRS, and HHS (75 FR 34538), June 17, 2010.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 695 - Health Benefits - HIPAA - Special Enrollment Periods\n\n\tIn an age of dual working couples, it is not unusual for one spouse to decline group health coverage under an employer's plan because he or she is covered as a dependent under a spouse's plan. If the spouse under whose insurance the couple is covered should leave his or her job, the other spouse could not obtain coverage under the other employer's plan for the couple until the next open enrollment period.\n\tIf certain conditions are met, a special enrollment period must be available even if it is not an open enrollment period. This special enrollment period must be offered if: (Reference 1 below)\n\t1. the employee or dependent was covered by another health plan or insurance at the time coverage previously was offered;\n\t2. if required by the plan, the employee stated in writing that the other coverage was the reason for declining enrollment; and\n\t3. the employee requests enrollment not later than 30 days after the loss of coverage.\n\n\tPointer: If the other coverage provided to an employee or a dependent is COBRA continuation coverage, the special enrollment can be requested only after exhausting COBRA continuation coverage. If the other coverage is not COBRA continuation coverage, special enrollment can be requested only after losing eligibility for the other coverage or after the cessation of employer contributions for the other coverage. A loss of eligibility for coverage includes (but is not limited to):\n\t\u25a1 loss of eligibility for coverage as a result of legal separation, divorce, cessation of dependent status, death of an employee, termination of employment, reduction in the number of hours of employment;\n\t\u25a1 in the case of coverage offered through an HMO that does not provide benefits to individuals who no longer reside, live or work in a service area, loss of coverage because an individual no longer resides, lives, or works in the service area, and no other benefit package is available to the individual;\n\t\u25a1 situations in which an individual incurs a claim that would meet or exceed a lifetime limit on all benefits;\n\t\u25a1 situations in which a plan no longer offers any benefits to the class of similarly situated individuals; and\n\t\u25a1 termination of employer contributions towards the employee's or dependent's coverage.(Reference 2 below)\n\n\tAn employee does not have any special enrollment rights if the employee loses the other coverage as a result of his or her failure to pay premiums or for cause (such as making a fraudulent claim).(Reference 3 below)\n\nNew dependents\n\n\tThere is a special enrollment period for new dependents. A group health plan must permit dependents of eligible employees to enroll for dependent coverage not less than 30 days beginning either on the date that dependent coverage is available or on the date the person becomes a dependent by marriage, birth, or adoption, whichever is later.\nNo waiting period may apply for the special dependent enrollment period.\n\nMedicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program\n\tPursuant to the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2009, a group health plan must permit an employee who is eligible, but not enrolled, for coverage under the plan to enroll if either of the following conditions are met:\n\t1. the employee or dependent covered under Medicaid or CHIP has coverage terminated as a result of loss of eligibility, and the employee requests coverage under the group health plan within 60 days after \tsuch termination; or\n\t2. the employee or dependent becomes eligible for Medicaid or CHIP assistance if the employee requests coverage within 60 days after the eligibility determination date. (Reference 4 below)\n\nModel language\n\n\tOn or before the time an employee is offered the opportunity to enroll in a group health plan, the plan must provide the employee with a description of the plan's special enrollment rules.(Reference 5 below) The following model language may be used to satisfy this requirement: \"If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance or group health plan coverage, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents in this plan if you or your dependents lose eligibility for that other coverage (or if the employer stops contributing towards your or your dependents' other coverage). However, you must request enrollment within [insert '30 days' or any longer period that applies under the plan] after your or your dependents' other coverage ends (or after the employer stops contributing toward the other coverage). In addition, if you have a new dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents. However, you must request enrollment within [insert '30 days' or any longer period that applies under the plan) after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. To request special enrollment or obtain more information, contact [insert the name, title, telephone number, and any additional contact information of the appropriate plan representative).\"\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Code Sec. 9801(f).\n2 IRS Reg. \u00a754.9801-6(a)(3)(i) and IRS Reg. \u00a754.9801-6(a) (3) (ii)\t\n3 Reg. \u00a7 54.9801-6(a) (3) (i);  ERISA Reg. \u00a72590.701-6(a)(3)(i).\n4 Code Sec. 9801(f) (3).\n5 IRS  Reg.  \u00a7 54.9801-6(c);  ERISA  Reg. \u00a7 2590.701-6(c\n"

To offset the cost of the higher attained age premiums of the new LTC plan and to recognize that the insured has contributed to a LTC insurance plan, the active life reserves that the insured has accumulated will be transferred to the new plan, if the insured decides to transfer. Transferring the reserves enables the new LTC plan to reduce premiums for the transferee by subtracting a discount from the insured's attained age premiums or allows the LTC plan to use the insured's original issue age under their prior plan when setting premium rates.\n\n              The insurer(s) and the employer will need to negotiate the terms of the transfer, such as who is eligible to transfer, what type of underwriting is to be used, and how the new premiums will be calculated. Transfers and upgrades require a considerable amount of administrative effort, including a customized premium quote for the new plan, the tracking of who has elected to transfer, and, for a transfer between insurers, the reconciliation of the final transfer list between insurers. Thus, a transfer provision is often included only in larger employer LTC insurance policies.\n"

A health savings account is exclusively for individuals who are enrolled in a qualifying high deductible health plan (HDHP), who are not Medicare recipients and who do not have any other healthcare coverage (except for insurance for accidents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care). Money contributed to an HSA can be used to cover medical expenses for the employee, his or her spouse and any qualified dependent. Contributions to an HSA are tax-exempt and employers can also contribute to HSAs the same as they would to a company health plan, even though the HSA is owned by the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee. All contributions to an HSA belong immediately to the employee.\n\tThe fact that an HSA belongs solely to the employee is a key feature of a health savings account. Because HSAs are owned by the individual employee they follow that individual even if he or she resigns, retires, or tem1inated. This is one of the biggest differences between an HSA and a Health Reimbursement Arrangement or HRA, which is owned by the employer.\n\tHSA funds can be used for a variety of medical purposes but they can also be used for non-medical expenses. However, account holders under 65 will have to pay income tax on the money spent on non-medical items plus a 20-percent penalty while account holders 65 or over will have to pay income tax on the cost of non\u00admedical items but won't be charged the 20-percent penalty.\n\tThere is also an annual limit on the amount of contributions that can be made to an HSA. The limit for 2020 (which is set by the IRS) is $3,450 for self-only coverage and $6,850 for family coverage. An additional $1,000 can be contributed by any individual who will be 55 or older at any time during the year. Contribution limits for 2021 are projected to be $3,600 for self\u00ad only coverage and $7,200 for family coverage.\n\nNote: Archer Medical Savings Accounts (Archer MSAs) are basically identical to HSAs, but are restricted to employers with less than 50 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? \n\n\tA medical Flexible Spending Account (also known as a flexible spending arrangement or FSA) is a special account that an employee can put pre-tax money into to pay for certain out-of\u00adpocket health care costs not covered by insurance. Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

However, reimbursement for cosmetic surgery neces\u00ad sary to improve a congenital abnormality or injury or necessary to restore a bodily function is allowed.(Reference 2 below) Long-term care insurance provided through an FSA loses its tax-favored status (see KB-1 Topic 2623).(Reference 3 below) \n\nlist of reimbursable expenses expands\n\tIn recent years, the IRS had specifically allowed for the reimbursement of nonprescription, over-the-counter drugs (see KB-1 Topic 2253) though 2010 health reform legislation changed this rule, for purchases after December 31, 2010. In two other rulings, the IRS indicated that expenses for breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy as well as vision correction surgery, such as Lasik, are reimbursable. However, the IRS disallowed reimbursement for teeth whitening procedures.(Reference 4  below)\n\nSmoking cessation programs\n\tReversing its long-standing position, the IRS now allows the costs of smoking cessation programs and of prescription drugs designed to alleviate nicotine withdrawal to be deductible as medical expenses. As a result, expenses paid by an employee for smoking cessation programs and for prescription nicotine withdrawal drugs are reimbursable by health FSAs.(Reference 5 below)\n\nReferences:\n1 Prop.

The information required to be reported includes the following:(Reference 3 below)\n\n\t1. the name, address, and employer identification number (EIN) of the reporting entity required to file the return;\n\t2. the name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), or date of birth if a TIN is not available, of the responsible individual, except that reporting entities may but are not required to report the TIN of a responsible individual not enrolled in the coverage;\n\t3. the name and TIN, or date of birth if a TIN is not available, of each individual who is covered under the policy or program;\n\t4. for each covered individual, the months for which, for at least one day, the individual was enrolled in coverage and entitled to receive benefits; and\n\t5. any other information specified in forms, instructions, or published guidance.\n\nTo the extent health insurance coverage is through an employer-provided group health plan, the insurer is also required to report the following:(Reference 4 below)\n\n\t1. the name, address, and EIN of the employer sponsoring the plan;\n\t2. whether the coverage is a qualified health plan enrolled in through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) and the SHOP's unique identifier; and\n\t3. other information specified in forms, instructions, or published guidance.\n\n\tReporting to individuals covered. In addition to providing the information to the IRS, the insurer is required to report the above information, along with the name, address and contact information of the reporting insurer, to the covered individual on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year for which the information is required to be reported.(Reference 5 below)\n\n\tThe IRS is required, not later than June 30 of each year, to provide annual notice to each individual who files an income tax return and who fails to enroll in minimum essential coverage.\n\n\tPenalties. Failure to file correct information returns reporting health insurance coverage is subject to the existing penalties under the Internal Revenue Code, as is failure to furnish correct payee statements to individuals with respect to whom information is reported.(Reference 6 below)\n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 21 - Social Insurance Programs - Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefits - Enrollment\n             Each individual entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Part B qualifies for Part D coverage. Individuals enrolled in traditional Medicare will receive their benefits through a stand-alone PDP. Individuals enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan will have coverage through an MA-PD plan. (See Appendix 21.2 for a list of communications materials used to educate beneficiaries about Part D.)\n\n             Most eligible Part D beneficiaries were able to choose a Part D plan starting on November 15, 2005. Two special groups were identified for consideration:\n\u25a0 Dual eligibles (individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid). These individuals were automatically enrolled in a Part D plan. A dual eligible is a Medicare beneficiary who is currently receiving state Medicaid benefits. Medicaid drug coverage for Medicare eligibles was terminated on December 31, 2005. In order to continue drug coverage, dual eligibles were automatically assigned to qualifying plans starting in October 2005. These individuals can switch out of their automatically assigned plans every 30 days.\n\u25a0 Limited-income beneficiaries. These individuals were eligible for a low-income cost-sharing subsidy (LICS).\n\n            The Medicare Part D subsidy starts on the date when the dual-eligible senior becomes eligible. If a delay occurs in starting the senior on the pro\u00ad gram, the senior is eligible for retroactive coverage for prescription medications back to the eligibility date. Effective in 2011, the annual coordinated election period (also known as the annual open enrollment period (AEP)) will be from October 15 to December 7 for the 2012 plan year. (Note that the first-year open enrollment period was November 15, 2005, through May 15, 2006.) Beneficiaries have an option of at least two Part D plans per region.\n\n            Retirees must follow their employers' plan coverage rules to remain eligible for their retiree coverage. However, if retirees decide to leave their employer coverage midyear, they may enroll in a Medicare Part D plan only during the Medicare open enrollment period. For example, if a retiree left the employer's Part D plan in July, he or she would have to wait until the November open enrollment period for coverage for the following year. Exceptions are allowed for the following special circumstances:\n\u25a0 Beneficiaries who permanently move out of the plan service area\n\u25a0 Individuals entering, residing in, or leaving a long-term care facility\n\u25a0 Involuntary loss, reduction, or nonnotification of creditable coverage\n\u25a0 Other exceptional circumstances\n            Some Medicare patients may be subject to a late enrollment penalty if they do not sign up for Part D when they are first eligible. This late penalty fee is a carryover from Medicare Part B. Two categories of patients are at risk. The first group includes patients who were eligible for Medicare before January 2006 and had to sign up by May 15, 2006, to avoid a higher premium. The second group includes patients who became eligible for Medicare after January 2006 and had to sign up for Part D within 63 days after the end of their initial enrollment period to avoid a higher premium.\n\n             The higher premium will be based on an increase of at least 1 percent of the base beneficiary premium (i.e., $31.94 for 2010) per month for every month that they waited to enroll. This premium may change each year. For example, if John Doe is without creditable coverage for 18 months, his penalty is 18 percent (1 percent x 18 months) multiplied by $31.94 (base beneficiary premium) = $5.75. This amount would then be added to the monthly premium, for example $20.00. In this example, John Doe would pay a higher premium of $20.00 + $5.75 = $25.75.\n\n             The fees will be reflected in higher monthly premiums for the beneficiary's lifetime. However, if a Medicare beneficiary has a creditable coverage equivalent to or better than Part D (e.g., employer or retirement plan), this penalty does not apply.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1005 - Retiree Health Care - Role of Medicare\n\n\tThe Social Security system includes a system of hospital insurance and medical care for persons age 65 and over known as Medicare. A federal government agency known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the program. Medicare is designed to protect retirees age 65 and over from devastating medical costs that result from long-term hospitalization. Long-term care outside of a hospital is a cost not adequately covered by government or employer medical plans.\n\tThe Medicare program has a role in assisting employers to provide retiree health care.\n\nEligibility\n\tBroadly, Medicare entitles those individuals who are age 65 or over and eligible to receive Social Security benefits, survivor benefits, or disability benefits to hospital coverage and, at an additional cost, to insured physician payments. These are the two parts of Medicare, known as Part A and Part B.\n\nPart A coverage\n\tPart A of Medicare pays for inpatient hospital care and services and covers skilled nursing home services. Inpatient care includes medically necessary nursing, drugs, diagnostic or therapeutic care, supplies, equipment, and appliances. Home health care or hospice care may also qualify for reimbursement by Medicare.\n\tPart A is subject to deductibles on a per-episode basis ($1,408 for 2020) and to coinsurance for each day of care beyond the sixtieth. There are limits on the number of days allowed for skilled nursing care and psychiatric hospitalization.\n\tMost people do not pay a monthly Part A premium because they or a spouse has 40 or more quarters of Medicare-covered employment. In fact, only about one percent of people with Medicare pay a premium for Part A services. For people who have to buy Part A, the full Part A premium for 2020 is $458 per month.\n\n\nPart B coverage\n\tPart B applies to physician and professional services. This coverage is voluntary and costs the Medicare beneficiary a premium on a monthly basis. The standard Part B premium amount in 2020 will be $144.60, though an income-related adjustment will be applied to individuals and couples at higher incomes. However, most people who get Social Security benefits will pay less than this amount. The annual deductible for Part B for 2020 is $198 per year. Covered services include ambulance, X-ray and diagnostic tests, ambulatory surgical care, outpatient hospital care, physical and occupational therapy, durable medical equipment, and physician charges whether the patient is hospitalized or not.\n\tThe Medicare beneficiary may pay for Part B services by assigning payment or by seeking reimbursement for payments made to the health care provider. Reimbursement allowances are based on reasonable and customary charges, except for physician's services, which are based on a fee schedule. Physicians are allowed to collect coinsurance amounts from the beneficiary.\n\tPointer: Because of the deductibles and co-insurance amounts required under both Parts A and B, a large percentage of Medicare beneficiaries have some type of private supplemental health insurance (known as Medigap) to fill specific gaps in the Medicare coverage system.\n\nMedicare Part D\n\tThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-173) created a new Medicare Part D Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program. The program became effective January 1, 2006, and is the primary payor of prescription drugs for Medicare-eligible individuals who are no longer employed.\n\tA standard prescription drug plan beginning in 2020 requires a $435 deductible. The beneficiary pays 25 percent of the drug costs up to $4,020 (in 2020) after the deductible is met. Drug costs above $4,020 are paid out-of-pocket until the beneficiary has paid $6,350 in 2020. In 2020, after exiting the donut hole, co-pays are $3.60 for generics and preferred multiple source drugs and $8.95 for all other drugs. After the $5,100 figure is met, the beneficiary pays 5 percent of the drug cost, or a modest copayment. A subsidy is available for low-income beneficiaries. However, many prescription plans are available which offer better than the standard benefits, with deductibles of zero, and coverage in the \"gap.\"\n\tThe Act also provides for a nontaxable subsidy to employers that maintain retiree drug benefits that are \"actuarially equivalent\" to Medicare Part D. Employers will have to retain records that are sufficient to ensure the adequacy of the coverage and the accuracy of the payments made. The employers must also tell HHS and Part D-eligible individuals whether or not the plan meets the actuarial equivalence standard.\n\tElimination of deduction for Part D subsidy. Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), the provision that allows an employer to disregard the value of any qualified retiree prescription drug plan subsidy in calculating the employer's business deduction for retiree prescription drug costs was repealed, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2012. Thus, the amount otherwise allowable as a business deduction for retiree prescription drug expenses will be reduced by the amount of the excludable subsidy payments received.(Reference 1 below)\n\nMedicare payment systems\n\tMedicare pays for most Part A services under a prospective payment system (PPS). Under this system, payment for care is based on the assignment of the case to a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). See below.\n\nMedicare as secondary payer\n\tOriginally, Medicare was the primary insurer for the working aged (those individuals who are age 65 and older but continue to work for an employer of 20 or more employees). As the expenses of Medicare rose, Congress began to look for ways to shift the cost burden to private insurance companies.\n\tIn 1980, Congress enacted the first set of Medicare Secondary Payer provisions that transferred the responsibility of paying primary health care benefits for the working aged to private employer health plans. The laws were refined subsequently to permit the government to recover overpayments from the person, the employer plan, the provider, any third party, or \"any entity that would be responsible for payment with respect to such item or service.\"\n\tWhen a payment by Medicare is on behalf of a plan for which the insurer acts solely as administrator, the government must look to the employer, rather than to the insurer, for reimbursement. Furthermore, an insurer must notify the government when. it learns of a possible primary payment by Medicare, regardless of whether the payment has actually been made.\n\tGenerally, Medicare has carved out certain segments of the age 65 and over population. For individuals who continue to work past age 65, Medicare is the secondary payer. For spouses 65 or older, even if the employee is under age 65, Medicare is the secondary payer.\n\n\tEmployers are required to offer employees age 65 or over the same group health plan coverage as is available to younger employees. The employee and spouse then have the option of choosing the employer plan or Medicare as their primary plan. If they choose Medicare as the primary plan, the employer may not offer complementary coverage, however, if the employer plan is primary, Medicare is the secondary plan.\n\tPointer: This does not require\u00b7 employers to offer coverage if they do not normally do so. However, it does mean that employers must extend the coverage to persons who work past age 65 if the employer offers a health plan.\n\nDiagnosis related groups\n\tIn order to try to cope with spiraling medical costs, Medicare adopted in 1983 a payment system to regulate the cost of care based on the type of illness. Diseases were categorized into Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Reimbursement from Medicare for inpatient hospital care depended on the DRG assigned, which was based on the diagnosis and procedure, age of the patient, and complications, if any. The type of hospital and its mix of cases also contributed to the weight assigned to each DRG.\n\tAt first, physicians and hospitals accepted Medicare's estimate based on reasonable and customary charges as payment in full. As their costs escalated and the freeze on physician cost increases continued, however, the doctors no longer accepted the Medicare amount as full payment, but began to shift costs to the patient. This cost-shifting affected both individuals and employers whose plans paid for what Medicare did not cover or reimburse fully.\n\tDRGs assign patients and the kinds of resources used to treat them into approximately 510 categories within 25 major diagnostic categories (MDCs).\nThe assignment to a DRG is made by compiling the diagnoses and any procedure codes for the treatment. When the initial and subsequent diagnoses are made, a code is assigned. If a surgical procedure is performed, a procedure code is noted. These codes, the patient's age and sex, and any complications are consid\u00ad ered together and a DRG is assigned to the case.\n\tUnder PPS, the DRG may be weighted for the type of facility, case mix, and location. The system then assigns a fixed price for the discharge. Hospitals may retain any difference between the DRG reimbursement and the actual cost, but are to absorb any shortfall.\n\nPhysician reimbursement system\n\tMedicare has extended the DRG concept of payment to physician fees by establishing a resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). The program is de\u00ad signed not only to control costs but also to encourage prevention and discourage technical medical intervention. Rather than reasonable and customary being the basis for accepting charges from a physician, RBRVS considers the resources required for each service, a monetary conversion factor, and the geographic location. Services of family practitioners are valued higher than those of surgeons and radiologists. In addition, balance billing by nonparticipating physicians is limited.\n\nCase review\n\tMedicare also attempts to ensure appropriate care by reviewing cases. Peer review organizations (PROs) evaluate the medical necessity of the treatment on a retrospective basis. If PROs find treatment was not needed, physicians must refund to the patient any fees collected for this care. The burden for efficient care now rests with the facilities that choose to accept Medicare patients. The patients are protected against extreme costs since their doctors have accepted the Medicare payment.\n\nEmployers and Medicare\n\tEmployers attempting to coordinate a retiree health care program with Medi\u00ad care are aiming at a moving target. Coverage and premium costs change, yet employers do not want to absorb the full burden of hospital costs so long as the government program is adequate. Medicare does not cover all retirees. People who retired before attaining age 65 are not covered until they reach age 65. Those who are 65 but are not eligible for Social Security benefits may not be eligible for Medicare.\n\tHowever, many employers have found that coordinating a retiree medical plan similar in design to preretirement medical plans with Medicare is the least expensive way for an employer to provide coverage to retirees age 65 and over.\n\n\tThe three most common methods of coordinating retiree medical benefits with Medicare are the following:\n\tl. carve-out method-this method enables a company to limit plan liability to the difference between the amount covered by Medicare and the amount the company's plan would normally pay;\n\t2. standard coordination method-this method requires the plan to pay the usual benefit, not exceeding the amount of an expense that has not been paid by Medicare-this provides the most generous net benefit of the three choices; \t\tand\n\t3. government exclusion or Medicare exclusion method\u00ad this method allows a plan to reduce the amount of an expense not covered by Medicare by applying the plan deductible and coinsurance amounts to determine the actual benefit \t\tpayable.\n\nMedicare coverage\n\tAs currently structured, Medicare has several significant exclusions, namely, long-term custodial care, non-hospital mental health care, and elective care.\n\nSupplementary insurance\n\tBecause of the deductibles and coinsurance amounts required under both Parts A and B, most Medicare beneficiaries have some type of private supplemental health insurance coverage. The law provides rules governing Medigap insurance (i.e., supplemental insurance policies that are designed to fill specific gaps in the Medicare benefit structure).\n\nFor more information ...\n\tMedicare risk HMOs are addressed in more detail at KB-1 Topic 1007.\n\tMedicare is covered in greater depth at KB-1 Topic 53,140 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 Code Sec. 139A, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act) (P.L. 111-148); Act Sec. 9012(b) of the Affordable Care Act, as amended by Act Sec. 1407 of the Health Care and Education Reconcilia\u00ad tion Act of 2010 (P.L. ill-152).\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Provider Networks\n\nprovider network\t\n         Networks of providers of health care services and the contracts that establish them are essential to managed care plans. These plans manage care primarily through the provider network that members in the plan are encouraged to use. Members may be required to receive covered medical care services from network providers only, or they must use these providers in order to obtain full plan benefits. To be successful, a managed care plan must create and maintain provider networks that do the following:\n\u2022 contain qualified providers of health care services\n\u2022 meet member needs for medical care services\n\u2022 compensate network providers in a manner that encourages efficient use of resources\n\n\nQualified Providers of Health Care Services\ncredentials\t\n          Managed care plans specify the qualifications, known as credentials, that providers must have and maintain to be a network participant. Physicians, for example, must document their training, licensure, certification in a specialty, and malpractice insurance coverage. In addition, they must be free of limitations, suspensions, or impairments that would affect their practice of medicine and hospital admitting privileges. Hospitals and other institutions must be licensed, accredited, and approved for participation in the Medicare program. Generally, a credentialing verification organization hired by the managed care plan obtains the information to determine if a provider has the qualifications that the plan requires. The plan repeats the credentialing process periodically to make sure that network providers continue to meet the required qualifications.\n\nMember Needs for Medical Care Services\n           A managed care plan's provider network must encompass the broad scope of health services that members may need and be conveniently accessible to those members.\n\n           Network providers include physicians, hospitals and other institutions, diagnostic radiology and laboratory services, and therapy services. Among the other institutions in a network are facilities that provide outpatient care, including surgery, rehabilitation, and skilled-nursing care. Although a few managed care plans may hire their health care professionals and own their facilities, most managed care plans establish their networks through contracts with providers. These providers may be solo practitioners or participate in various types of groups under a variety of organizational structures. A provider often participates in several networks and also treats patients who are not members of managed care plans. Plans may also contract with specialty care organizations for specific services. These services may include psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, radiology, laboratory and pathology services, transplant surgeries, and prescription drug services.\n\n             Networks need to allow members to have reasonably convenient access to the broad range of services that the managed care plan offers. Therefore, managed care plans must develop and maintain sufficient numbers and types of providers to meet member health care needs in a geographic area. In addition, most network physicians must remain open to accepting as patients those members who are new to the plan as well as those who may wish to change providers. As a result, most plans maintain active recruitment and management programs to make sure that their networks keep pace with the needs of their ever-changing member populations in the areas and regions where these members reside. However, competition for members frequently requires managed care plans to expand their networks to offer members a choice of physicians, specialists, and hospitals beyond that required by scope of service and convenience alone.\n\nProvider Compensation\n             A major objective of managed care plans is cost containment through the efficient use of health care resources. The method of provider compensation is one major component of this objective.\n\n             Providers are willing to grant preferred rates to managed care plans because as participants in the plan's network they anticipate an increased number of patients who will utilize their services. Or conversely, they will not lose patients to providers who are network providers. The specific payment method for network providers varies by the type of provider and the negotiating strength of the plan. However, the managed care plan's objective remains the same under any payment arrangement: to control the price of services and the overall increase in the cost of services utilized.\n\n             The compensation for services is determined by agreement in advance of the provision of services and a plan cannot change it for a specified period without notification. It also usually requires the agreement of each party. An important part of the contract with a provider outlines the provider's obligation to accept the agreed-upon amount as payment in full, except for copayments and other clearly identified amounts which the provider must collect from plan members.\n\n              The payment method also intends, if possible, to have providers participate to some degree in the increased cost of services utilized either through incentive payments for meeting utilization targets or penalties for failure to do so. The payment methods managed care plans use include capitation, modification of the traditional fee-for-service payment system, and per-day and per-case rates.\n\n\nCapitation\ncapitation\t\t\n              Although far from dominant, the payment method historically associated with managed care plans is capitation. HMOs frequently employ this method for the payment of primary care physicians if each HMO member is required to select or is assigned a primary care physician who is responsible for the member's care. Primary care physicians provide members with basic health care services and coordinate additional care needs through referrals to other network physicians for certain medical specialist services. Under capitation, these physicians receive a fixed payment per month for each member without regard to the services a member may receive in any particular month. These rates reflect likely utilization of services by the plan's members based on age and gender and the cost of care in the area. Capitation provides physicians no financial incentives to overtreat patients.\n\n\nincentive payment program\nwithhold arrangement\n              In conjunction with capitation, a managed care plan commonly establishes an incentive payment program that rewards physicians who meet budgeted cost and utilization levels for hospital and ancillary services. This program may include other criteria such as meeting member satisfaction and quality standards. Such an incentive program is called a withhold arrangement if it imposes financial penalties or decreases compensation for failure to meet these same criteria.\n\n              HMOs may also use capitation in some cases for the payment of specialty physicians and services such as substance abuse care and chronic condition management. Although infrequent, payment arrangements for inpatient hospital services may also use capitation.\n\n\nModified Fee-For-Service Payments\nmodifiedfee-for-service payment system\n              Despite the cost containment advantages of capitation,\na modified fee-for-service payment system is the dominant method for compensating physicians in managed care plans. Many specialty physicians in managed care plans and most physicians in PPO networks receive payment in this manner. Managed care organizations also occasionally used it with hospitals.\n\n               With this method of compensation, the plan pays providers on a fee-for-service basis, subject to negotiated maximums per procedure. In most cases, this involves a discount from what the physician would charge a patient who did not participate in the managed care plan.\n\n               Modified fee-for-service payment arrangements employed by managed care plans often include some element of physician financial involvement in cost containment through rewards or penalties based on success in achieving the plan's utilization and cost targets. These rewards and penalties are similar to the incentive and withhold arrangements discussed previously under capitation payment.\n\n\nPer-Day and Per-Case Payments\nper-day rate\n                The dominant arrangement used by managed care plans for payment of inpatient hospital services is a negotiated per-day rate. With this approach, a plan pays a hospital a specified amount for each day a plan member is hospitalized, regardless of the actual cost of services on any particular day. The rate usually differs by type or level of care such as intensive care, obstetrics, or rehabilitation. The rate may decrease in relation to the days the member stays in the hospital or the aggregate days of stay for all plan members.\n\nper-case rate\ndiagnosis-related groups\n                 A managed care plan may be able to control costs more effectively by using a per-case rate to pay for hospital stays. With this approach, the plan pays a specified fee for all inpatient costs, regardless of a member's length of stay. This fee is based on such factors as a member's principal diagnosis, secondary diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, gender, and presence of complications. This system of classification of services is often referred to as diagnosis-related groups.\n\n                 Managed care plans also often use a per-case rate to reimburse hospitals and other providers for nonphysician services that members receive on an outpatient basis.\n"

Hospitals and physicians participating in such networks generally discount their services to plan participants by approximately 15 percent.\n    To encourage employee participation, employers often reduce the level of employee coinsurance when an employee uses network providers (for example, employees may pay 10 percent when using the PPO, instead of 20 percent when using non-PPO providers).\n    Employees have more flexibility under such an arrangement in that a PPO is a fee-for-service arrangement in which there is a choice of provider. Unlike HMOs, which determine fees on a per-person basis, however, PPOs determine fees on a per-service basis.\n    The following provider, financial, and customer-service factors should be considered in evaluating PPO performance:\n\nProvider information\n    Provider information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How are providers solicited and screened?\n\u25a1 Are there sufficient network providers for good freedom of choice?\n\u25a1 Are network providers accessible to employees?\n\u25a1 What is the turnover of providers in the program?\n\u25a1 Are providers generally available or are there special schedules?\n\u25a1 What providers are in the network, and are they the same providers employees use?\n\nFinancial information\n    Financial information factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 How long has the PPO been in existence?\n\u25a1 Is the sponsor financially sound?\n\u25a1 Are there administrative costs?\n\u25a1 What is the effect on insurance premiums?\n\u25a1 How much are the provider discounts?\n\u25a1 Are there utilization controls to prevent PPOs from making fraudulent claims or providing unnecessary services?\n\u25a1 Has credentialing been sought?\n\nCustomer service factors\n    Customer service factors to consider are:\n\u25a1 Does the sponsor help market the program to employees?\n\u25a1 Are there special program features for emergencies or information?\n\u25a1 Are the program mechanics convenient and easy for employees to use?\n\u25a1 How are problems resolved?\n"

                    "text": "KB-2 - Chapter 8 - Medical and Other Health Benefits - Understanding Behavioral Health Care Benefits - Care Management and Cost Control\n        Care management and cost control include items such as care access, pre\u00ad dictive modeling and assessment, performance measurement, outcomes management, and coordination of care.\n\nCare Access\n         MBHOs traditionally require preauthorization to access treatment. MBHOs generally operate their own customer service centers, and when a member calls for a referral, an intake specialist asks the member a series of questions to establish the reason for the call, assess risk, acuity, specialty needs, and member preference. After listening to the caller's concerns and explaining the nature of the caller's benefits, the intake specialist separates routine from urgent and emergency situations. More than 80 percent of incoming calls are generally for routine referrals; industry standards dictate that members receiving routine referrals must be seen by a provider within 10 business days. If a member's needs are urgent, an appointment is arranged within 48 hours, although the more stringent standard of 24 hours is adopted for some contracts. If an individual requires immediate, emergency services (e.g., he or she is suicidal or homicidal), referral is generally made to a hospital or inpatient facility if an immediate appointment is not available with a network practitioner. Most MBHOs employ a dedicated team of licensed crisis care managers, who are specially trained in emergency protocol, active listening, diffusing, and referral. Ambulance services and/or police may also be involved in diffusing hostile situations and transferring an individual to psychiatric facilities.\n\nPredictive Modeling and Risk Assessment\n         High-service utilizers-generally individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major recurrent depression\u00adrepresent a small percentage of overall service users but account for a disproportionate, higher pen;:entage of treatment resources and claims costs. MBHOs analyze claims and treatment data to identify high-risk members who have a history of high utilization and repeated hospitalizations. Predictive modeling techniques provide the ability to forecast who those high-risk, potentially high-cost members are, and intervene in time to avoid preventable treatment costs. The degree of risk can be identified and members stratified accordingly, so care management resources can be applied most effectively and efficiently. MBHO care management resources tend to be in short supply, so it pays to use those limited resources to deliver the best clinical and economic value to both the member and the payer.\n\nPerformance Measurement\n        MBHOs typically measure provider network performance through a num\u00ad ber of variables, which include accessibility, utilization, and adequacy and appropriateness of treatment. Traditionally, these performance data are collected after the fact through provider assessment reports and claims data. Today, however, some MBHOs are collecting member-reported and provider-reported data earlier on in the process to guide timely treatment interventions that can avert unnecessary emergency hospitalizations and contribute to more effective treatment outcomes. Profiling provider performance on clinical outcomes is an important step forward in the performance measurement arena.\n\nCase Management\n        Case management is a term that refers to oversight of an MBHO member's treatment to ensure it is appropriate. Case managers employed by the MBHO coordinate the member's care in collaboration with treating providers, facilities, and community resources, and often work with members and their families to ensure they continue to receive the appropriate level of care for their fluctuating needs. This ensures a cost-effective course of treatment in an appropriate setting. Potentially high service utilizers are identified so case managers can focus on those individuals with the greatest needs to ensure they continually receive appropriate treatment levels. Most MBHOs use an escalating series of models or protocols based on the patient's level of acuity and chronicity, which determine how frequently case managers monitor treatment. Case management goals are crisis stabi\u00ad lization, prevention of long-term disability, and reduced reliance on hospital care by facilitating patient engagement in outpatient treatment and community resources.\n\nUtilization Review and Management\n       Utilization review is an activity that determines the medical necessity and appropriateness of treatment being provided, and is performed at various times, including at the point of care (prospective review), during care (concurrent review), and after treatment (retrospective review). While MBHOs generally perform this function, self-funded employers and health plans may purchase this service from stand-alone utilization review organizations. MBHOs utilize written criteria based on clinical evidence to guide the evaluation of the medical necessity, appropriateness, and efficiency of mental health and chemical dependency services.\n\nOutcomes Management\n      MBHOs have developed tools to assess treatment effectiveness and quantify outcomes, bringing technology, data, and increased objectivity to a field once dominated by subjective assessment. The measurement of outcomes concurrent with the treatment process is the most powerful approach to outcomes management because feedback to clinicians can shape care as it is being delivered. The objectives of outcomes management are to identify risks early so treatment interventions contribute to more positive outcomes, as well as prevent emergencies and unnecessary hospitalizations. \n\nCoordination of Care\n     Behavioral disorders often coexist with each other (e.g., depression and substance abuse), and with medical disorders (e.g., depression and chronic heart disease). An individual may be seeing his or her primary care doctor for treatment of a physical disorder and a behavioral specialist for treatment of a mental disorder. Coordination of medical and behavioral health care services results in improved treatment outcomes for patients. When coordination of care does not take place, there are increased risks, such as repeated or unnecessary testing and adverse drug reactions. A consumer in today's complex health care environment is faced with a mind-boggling array of organizations, programs, services, and providers, each of which can play a vital role in his or her care and successful recovery. Patients benefit from an interconnected series of care coordination protocols between behavioral health specialists, primary care/medical doctors, medical plans, MBHOs, pharmacy benefit managers, and community affiliates. Health care accrediting and regulatory bodies are pressing the managed care industry to integrate behavioral care into medical delivery systems. Even though progress has been made, much work is needed to create a truly integrated health care system.\n\nDepression Disease Management Programs\n      Depression is a mental illness that often goes unnoticed, and it co-occurs with many physical illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease. It is increasingly a focus of disease management initiatives because of its chronic nature and large economic impact. MBHO depression disease management programs support the clinician-patient relationship and plan of care, and emphasize prevention of disease-related exacerbations and complications using evidence-based guidelines and patient empowerment tools. These programs require coordination among health plans, physicians, pharmacists, and patients. Disease management can improve patient outcomes and quality of life while potentially reducing overall health care costs. \n\nSubstance Abuse Relapse Programs\n        Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is a chronic condition, characterized by relapses. Therefore, the prevention of relapse is one of the critical elements in successful treatment. Standard chemical dependency treatment was once a 28-day inpatient treatment program. Since detoxification on an outpatient basis is more often recommended today, only persons with severe withdrawal and other medical complications now require hospitalization. Most substance abuse treatment experts today consider intensive outpatient treatment more effective for most patients in treating chemical dependency. Outpatient programs encourage individuals to remain sober while confronting their day-to\u00adday living situations. In addition, most MBHOs today offer after-care programs to their members who complete a course of chemical dependency treatment. The programs are aimed at preventing relapse and often include telephonic support and self-help tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

EPO members are responsible for small co-payments and may have to pay a deductible before insurance coverage takes over.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 400 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Mental Health Benefits\n\n    Most states require insurers to provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment. Most larger employers offer mental health coverage, but on a more restrictive basis than for other conditions.\n    As is true for substance abuse treatment (see KB-1 Topic 405), coverage for mental health treatment often carries specific limits for:\n\u25a1 days of care per year and lifetime;\n\u25a1 dollars to be reimbursed;\n\u25a1 number of hospital stays per year and on a lifetime basis;\n\u25a1 number of outpatient visits per year and on a lifetime basis; and\n\u25a1 annual or lifetime limits on total mental health benefits provided.\n    Pointer: EAPs (see KB-1 Topic 1100) can help employers to reduce mental health care costs.\n\nMental health parity\n    Under the federal Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA), health plans that have lifetime or annual limits on what the plans will spend for medical or surgical services must either include services for mental illness in their total limit or maintain a separate limit for mental illness that is no more restrictive than the medical/surgical limit (Reference 1 below).\n    The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), as set forth in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) adds financial requirements and treatment limitations to the existing mental health parity provisions and expressly adds substance use disorder to the coverage of the parity provisions (Reference 2 below). Group plans that provide both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits must apply the financial requirements for both benefits equally. Financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance addiction should not be more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to other health benefits and there should be no separate cost sharing requirements or treatment limitations applicable only to mental health or substance addiction benefits.\n    Financial requirement and treatment limitation. \"Financial requirement\" includes deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket expenses, but excludes the existing aggregate lifetime limit and an annual limit under the Internal Revenue Code, ERISA and PHSA. A financial requirement or treatment limit is considered \"predominant\" if it is the most common of such type of limit or requirement. \"Treatment limitation\" includes limits on the frequency of treatment, number of visits, days of coverage, or other similar limits on the scope or duration of treatment (Reference 3 below). \n    The general parity requirement prohibits a plan (or health insurance coverage) from applying any financial requirement or treatment limitation to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the \"predominant\" financial requirement or treatment limitation applied to \"substantially all\" medical/surgical benefits in the same classification. The general parity requirement applies separately for each type of financial requirement or treatment limitation (that is, for example, copayments are compared to copayments, and deductibles to deductibles) (Reference 4 below).\n    The parity requirements for financial requirements and treatment limitations are applied on a classification-by-classification basis. There are six exclusive classifications used for purposes of satisfying the parity requirements: inpatient, in\u00adnetwork; inpatient, out-of-network; outpatient, in-network; outpatient, out-of-net\u00adwork; emergency care; and prescription drugs. If a plan provides any benefits for a mental health condition or substance use disorder, benefits must be provided in each classification for which any medical/surgical benefits are provided (Reference 5 below).\n    The portion of plan payments subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation (such as day limits, visit limits, frequency of treatment limits) is based on the dollar amount of all plan payments for medical/surgical benefits in the classification expected to be paid under the plan for the plan year. Any reasonable method may be used to determine the dollar amount expected to be paid under the plan for medical/surgical benefits subject to a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation.\n    The first step in applying the general parity requirement is to determine whether a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to \"substantially all\" medical/surgical benefits in a classification. A financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation applies to substantially all medical/surgical benefits in a classification if it applies to at least two-thirds of the benefits in that classification. If a financial requirement or quantitative treatment limitation does not apply to at least two-thirds of the medical surgical benefits, that type of requirement or limitation cannot be applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits (Reference 6 below).\n    The Labor Department (DOL), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the IRS have provided further clarification by specifically stating that the criteria for making medical necessity determinations, as well as any processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used in developing the underlying nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTL) and in applying it, must be disclosed with respect to both mental health and substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits, regardless of any assertions as to the proprietary nature or commercial value of the information (Reference 7 below).\n    In addition, although not required to do so, group health plans and issuers can provide a document that provides a description of the medical necessity criteria in layperson's terms. However, providing such a summary document is not a substitute for providing the actual underlying medical necessity criteria, if such documents are requested (Reference 8 below).\n    Opioid use disorder benefits. A plan may not impose a prior authorization requirements more stringently on drugs used for opioid treatment disorders than it imposes on prescription drugs used to treat medical/surgical conditions that carry similar safety risks (Reference 9 below). In addition, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors consider by a plan in designing and imposing a fail-first requirement for drugs used to treat opioid use disorders must be comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, and other factors used to apply fail-first requirements for medical/surgical benefits (Reference 10 below). Also, if a plan follows nationally-recognized treatment guidelines for setting prior authorization requirements for prescription drugs, but requires prior authorization for opioid treatment disorder prescription drugs every 30 days, at refill, it is violating the MHPAEA, because nationally-recognized treatment guidelines, such as those of the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASA) do not support 30-day authorization practices for such opioid disorder treatment medications as buprenorphine/naloxone (Reference 11 below).\n    Experimental treatment DOL FAQs issued in September 2019 address whether it is permissible for a plan to deny claims for Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy to treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder under the rationale that the treatment is experimental or investigative. With respect to medical/ surgical conditions, the plan approved treatment when supported by one or more professionally recognized treatment guidelines and two or more controlled random\u00ad ized trials.\n    A medical management standard limiting or excluding benefits based on whether a treatment is experimental or investigative is an NQTL under MHPAEA. Although the plan as written purports to exclude experimental or investigative treatment for both MH/SUD and medicai/surgical benefits using the same standards, in practice, it imposes this exclusion more stringently on MH/SUD benefits, as the plan denies all claims for ABA therapy, despite the fact that professionally recognized treatment guidelines and the requisite number of randomized controlled trials support the use of ABA therapy to treat children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Accordingly, because the plan applies the NQTL more stringently to mental health benefits than to medical/surgical benefits, the plan's exclusion of ABA therapy as experimental does not cotriply with MHPAEA (Reference 12 below).\n    Likewise, a plan does not comply with the MHPAEA where it defines experimental or investigative treatments as those with a rating below \"B\" in the Hayes Medical Technology Directory, but the plan reviews and covers certain treatments for medical/surgical conditions that have a rating of \"C\" on a treatment-by-treatment basis, while denying all benefits for MH/SUD treatment that have a rating of \"C\" or below, without reviewing the treatments to determine whether exceptions are appropriate. Although the text of the plan sets forth the same evidentiary standard for defining experimental as the Hayes Medical Directory ratings below \"B,\" the plan applies a different evidentiary standard, which is more stringent for MH/SUD benefits than for medical surgical benefits because the unconditional exclusion of treatments with a \"C\" rating for MH/SUD benefits is not comparable to the conditional exclusion of those treatments with a \"C\" rating for medical/surgical benefits. Because of the discrepant application of the evidentiary standard used by the plan, the fact that the plan ultimately denies some medical/surgical benefits that have a rating of \"C\" does not justify the total exclusion of treatments with a \"C\" rating for MH/SUD  (Reference 13 below).\n    Dosage limits. A plan does not comply with MHPAEA where it follows professionally-recognized treatment guidelines when setting dosage limits for prescription medications, but the dosage limit set by the plan for buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder is less than what professionally-recognized treatment guidelines generally recommend. However, the dosage limits set by the plan with respect to medical/surgical benefits are not less than the limits such treatment guidelines recommend. If the plan follows the dosage recommendations in professionally-recognized treatment guidelines to set dosage limits for prescription drugs in its formulary to treat medical/surgical conditions, it must also follow comparable treatment guidelines, and apply them no more stringently, in setting dosage limits for prescription drugs, including buprenorphine, to treat MH/SUD conditions (Reference 14 below).\n    Particular condition or disorder. A large group health plan or large group insurance coverage that provides benefits for prescription drugs to treat both medical/surgical and MH/SUD conditions but contains a general exclusion for items and services to treat a specific mental health condition, including prescription drugs, is permissible under the MHPAEA although if the plan is insured, it would depend on whether state law permits such an exclusion for large group insurance coverage. Generally, MHPAEA requires that treatment limitations imposed on MH/SUD benefits cannot be more restrictive than treatment limitations that apply to medical and surgical benefits. An exclusion of all benefits for a particular condition or disorder, however, is not a treatment limitation for purposes of the definition of \"treatment limitations\" in the MHPAEA regulations. Small employer group health insurance coverage and individual health insurance coverage are subject to the requirement to provide essential health benefits, and the determination of whether certain benefits must be covered under the requirements for essential health benefits depends on the benefits in the applicable State's ERB benchmark plan (Reference 15 below).\n    Step therapy. DOL FAQs also address a situation where a health plan requires step therapy for both medical/surgical and MH/SUD in-patient, in-net\u00adwork benefits. The plan requires a participant to have two unsuccessful attempts at outpatient treatment in the past 12 months to be eligible for certain inpatient in\u00ad network SUD benefits. However, the plan only requires one unsuccessful attempt at outpatient treatment in the past 12 months to be eligible for inpatient, in-network medical/ surgical benefits.\n    This is probably not permissible under the MHPAEA, according to the FAQs, because refusing to pay for a higher-cost therapy until it is shown that a lower-cost therapy is not effective (commonly known as \"step therapy protocols\" or \"fail-first policies\") is an NQTL. Although the same NQTL- step therapy- is applied to both MH/SUD benefits and medical/surgical benefits for eligibility for inpatient, in\u00adnetwork services, the requirement for two attempts at outpatient treatment to be eligible for inpatient; in-network SUD benefits is a more stringent application of the NQTL than the requirement for one attempt at outpatient treatment to be eligible for inpatient, in-network medical/surgical benefits. Unless the plan can demonstrate that evidentiary standards or other factors were utilized comparably to develop and apply the differing step therapy requirements for these MH/SUD and medical/surgical benefits, this NQTL does not comply with the MHPAEA (Reference 16 below).\n    Reimbursement rates. A plan also does not comply with the MHPAEA where its plan documents state that in-network provider reimbursement rates are determined based on the providers' required training, licensure, and expertise. However, medical/surgical benefits, reimbursement rates are generally the same for physicians and non-physician practitioners. For MH/SUD benefits, the plan pays reduced reimbursement rates for non-physician practitioners. While a plan is not required to pay identical provider reimbursement rates for medical/surgical and MH/SUD providers, a plan's standards for admitting a provider to participate in a network (including the plan's reimbursement rates for providers) is an NQTL (Reference 17 below).\n    Provider admission to network. DOL FAQs also address standards for provider admission to participate in a network. Such standards are an NQTL. Thus, in setting standards for provider admission to a network, where a plan's process to ensure the plan considers network adequacy with respect to providers of medical/ surgical services is not comparable to its process with respect to providers of MH/ SUD services, the plan does not comply with the MHPAEA To comply with MHPAEA, if the plan takes steps to ensure the plan has an adequate number of in\u00adnetwork medical/surgical providers, the plan must take comparable steps to ensure an adequate number of in-network MH/SUD providers, even if, following those steps, ultimately there are disparate numbers of MH/SUD and medical/surgical providers in the plan's network (Reference 18 below).\n    Non-hospital residential treatment for eating disorders. A plan also does not comply with the MHPAEA where it covers inpatient, out-of-network treatment outside a hospital for medical/surgical conditions so long as a prescribing physician obtains prior authorization from the plan, the treatment is medically appropriate for the individual, and the facility meets the licensing and certification requirements set by the plan, while the plan unequivocally excludes all inpatient, out-of-network treatment outside a hospital (in this FAQ, non-hospital residential treatment) for eating disorders. This restriction on non-hospital residential treatment for eating disorders is not comparable to the plan's coverage restrictions for inpatient treatment outside a hospital for medical/surgical conditions, which are less stringent (Reference 19 below).\n    Out-of-network providers. If a plan offers out-of-network benefits for medical or surgical care, it must also offer out-of-network coverage for mental health and addiction treatment and provide services at parity (Reference 20 below).\n    Availability of plan information. The criteria for medical necessity determinations made under a plan as well as any denial of reimbursement or payment of services with respect to mental health or substance addiction benefits must be made available to a current or potential participant, beneficiary, or contracting provider upon request (Reference 21 below). Plans that are subject to ERISA must provide the reason for the claim denial in a form and manner consistent with the rules for group health plans in the ERISA claims procedure regulations, which provide (among other things) that such disclosures must be provided automatically and free of charge. In the case of non-federal governmental and church plans (which are not subject to ERISA), compliance with the form and manner of the ERISA claims procedure regulations for group health plans satisfies this disclosure requirement (Reference 22 below).\n    Cost exemption. An employer may elect to apply mental health and substance addiction parity regardless of any increase in total cost. Generally, mental health and substance addiction parity will not apply if actual costs of coverage with respect to mental health and substance addiction benefits exceed two percent during the first plan year under the new law and one percent in each subsequent plan year, as determined and certified by a qualified and licensed actuary (Reference 23 below). The actuary should be a member in good standing of the American Academy of Actuaries and the determination should be in a written report. A plan that qualifies for a cost exemption and elects to implement the exemption shall promptly notify the appropriate Secretary (of the Treasury, Labor or Health and Human Services), the appropriate state agencies, and the participants and beneficiaries.\n\nExceptions\n    Businesses with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the federal mental health parity requirement. The EESA (see discussion above) revises the small employer exemption and provides that the term \"small employer\" means, with respect to a calendar year and a plan year, an employer who employed an average of at least 2 (or 1 in the case of an employer residing in a state that permits small groups to include a single individual) but not more than 50 employees on business days during the preceding calendar year (Reference 24 below).\n    Pointer: The mental health parity rule involves only annual and lifetime limits. It does not require health plans to offer mental health coverage.\n\nPenalty for noncompliance\n    A $100 per day penalty is imposed on employers whose group health plans fail to comply with the mental health parity provisions (Reference 25 below). The penalty is imposed for each day a failure occurs, until it is corrected and applies separately for each individual affected by the failure to comply. However, no penalty is imposed if the failure to comply is unintentional and corrected within 30 days after it is discovered (or should have been discovered). The penalty is limited for unintentional failures to the lesser of (1) 10 percent of the group health plan's expenses for the prior year or (2) $500,000 per tax year.\n\n\"Red flags\" that could mean your plan lacks parity\n    In June 2016, in response to requests for examples that should trigger careful analysis of coverage to determine MHPAEA compliance, the EBSA issued the following list of provisions that can serve as a red flag that a plan or issuer may be imposing an impermissible NQTL (Reference 26 below). The EBSA has stated that these terms do not, of course, automatically violate the law, but adds that the plan or issuer will need to provide evidence of compliance.\n    Also, the following categories are not exhaustive, and they are subordinate to any departmental regulations or interpretive guidance:\n    Preauthorization and pre-service notification requirements. This includes blanket preauthorization requirements and treatment facility admission preauthorization requirements such as requirements of precertification for inpatient mental health treatment. It also includes situations in which a plan's medical management program delegates its review authority to attending physicians for medical and surgical benefits, but does its own reviews for MH/SUD services, and extensive pre-notification requirements.\n    Fail-first protocols. This can include progress requirements, for which a plan requires, for coverage of intensive outpatient treatment for MH/SUD, that a patient has not achieved progress with non-intensive outpatient treatment of less frequency. Also included are treatment attempt requirements, which could include a requirement that a member first attempt two forms of outpatient treatment, or, for any inpatient MH/SUD services, that an individual first complete a partial hospitalization treatment program.\n    Probability of improvement. This could include situations in which a plan only covers services that result in measurable and substantial improvement in mental health status within 90 days.\n    Written treatment plan required. This could include requirements that a written treatment plan be prescribed and supervised by a behavioral health provider, that a treatment plan be submitted within a certain time period, or that a treatment plan submission is made on a regular basis.\n    Other. This includes provisions for patient non-compliance, such as excluding services for chemical dependency if someone fails to comply with a plan of treatment, plus residential treatment limits, geographical limitations, and licensure requirements.\n\nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Sec. 712, as added by P.L. 104-204.

                    "text": "KB-5 -   Provisions and Tax Treatment of Medical Expense Plans - Claims\n\nCLAIMS\n     The handling of medical expense claims is different, depending on whether a plan provides benefits on an indemnity basis or on a service basis.\n\n      Subrogation provisions may also apply.\n\nIndemnity Benefits\n       Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on an indemnity basis typically require that the insurance company (or other provider) receive a written proof of loss (that is, a claim form) concerning the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss for which a covered person makes a claim. This form usually contains portions that must be completed and signed by the employee, a representative of the employer, and the provider of medical services.\n\n      The period during which an employee must file a claim depends on the provider of coverage and any applicable state requirements. An employee generally has at least 90 days (or as soon as is reasonably possible) after medical expenses are incurred to file. Some insurance companies require notification within a shorter time (such as 20 days) about any illness or injury on which a claim may be based, even though they give a longer time for the actual filing of the form itself.\n\n       Individuals have the right to assign their benefits to the providers of medical services. A covered person generally makes such an assignment, which authorizes the insurance company to make the benefit payment directly to the provider by completing the appropriate portion of the claim form. In addition, the insurance company has the right (as it does in disability income insurance) to examine any person for whom a claim is filed at its own expense and with the physician of its own choice.\n\nService Benefits\n      Medical expense contracts that provide benefits on a service basis (such as HMOs and the Blues) generally do not require that covered persons file claim forms. Rather, the providers of health care services perform any necessary paperwork and receive reimbursement directly.\n\n      For example, when a physician presents a claim, the plan must determine one or more of the following: the physician's status as a network participant; the primary or specialty care nature of the service if rendered by a network participant; and the applicability of an authorization requirement. Depending upon the plan's stringency, the provider's reimbursement may be denied altogether or be far less than the amount charged if the member receives services from a nonnetwork provider or sees a specialist without a required referral. In turn, the payment made to the provider determines whether the enrollee must pay a modest copayment, a more substantial amount under an indemnity benefit as described above, or the total amount if there is a claim denial.\n\n      Network providers with capitation payment arrangements file patient encounter forms that in effect are claims that produce no payment for a specific service.\n\nSubrogation\n       Most self-funded plans contain subrogation provisions. If state law allows, they are also commonly contained in the group medical expense contracts of HMOs, PPOs, the Blues, and insurance companies. A subrogation provision gives the plan (or the organization providing plan benefits) the right to recover from a third party who is responsible through negligence or other wrongdoing for a covered person's injuries that result in a claim payment. If a covered person receives a settlement from the third party (or their liability insurance company) for medical expenses that the plan has already paid, the covered person must reimburse the plan. The plan also has the right to seek a recovery from the party at fault for benefits paid if the person who receives benefits does not take legal action.\n"

They come in two types: comprehensive and supplementary plans. The difference between the two is that comprehensive plans coinsure all covered medical expenses once the deductible is met, while supplementary plans coinsure all covered medical expenses (once the deductible is met) that are over and above those expenses covered by another plan.\n\nBoth types have high deductibles, co-insurance requirements, and a ceiling on the amount of benefits available during the plan year. However, both types of major medical insurance offer advantages over basic coverage health care plans:\n\u2022 Rather than covering only certain specified medical expenses, major medical plans cover almost all personal medical expenses whether the expense was incurred inside or outside of a hospital.\n\u2022 Major medical plans reimburse virtually all patients according to the same formula, regardless of the specialty of the physician, the location of the treatment, the drugs used, or the diagnostic techniques employed.\n\u2022 The maximum amount of benefits payable is considerably higher under a major medical plan than under a basic medical plan, particularly for physician and surgeon fees.\n\u2022 Having employees pay a deductible and co-insurance tends to keep them from making unnecessary visits to the doctor, which helps keep insurance costs down.\n"

If an employee dies, becomes incapacitated, loses his or her job or suffers a reduction in work hours, health care coverage can be extended for up to 18 or 36 months, depending on circumstances. \n\n                       The cost of health insurance provided under COBRA is usually high, because the recipient pays the entire premium including the portion that was being paid by the employer. In that sense, COBRA coverage is primarily a stop-gap until less expensive health insurance can be found.\n\n                       To qualify for COBRA coverage, an employee has to have been enrolled in a company-sponsored group health insurance plan on the day before the qualifying event (loss of job, reduced hours, etc.) occurs and the insurance plan must have been in effect on more than 50% of the employer's typical business days during the previous calendar year. ln addition, the employer must still be offering existing employees a group health plan; if the employer stops offering health coverage or goes out of business or drops below 20 employees the employee seeking COBRA coverage may no longer be eligible for extended insurance benefits.\n\n                       Even small employers with less than 20 employees may be required to provide extended insurance coverage to employees who have suffered a qualifying event. Many states have laws similar to COBRA. These \"mini-COBRA\" laws generally apply to employers of all sizes, including those with fewer than 20 employees.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 1430 - Continuation Coverage - COBRA - Qualified Beneficiaries-People Eligible for COBRA Coverage\n\n\tCOBRA coverage is available only for qualified beneficiaries. For COBRA purposes, a qualified beneficiary is generally anyone who is covered under a group health plan on the day before a qualifying event, including the spouse and dependent children of a covered employee.(Reference 1 below)\n\tCovered employees. \"Covered employee\" also includes self-employed persons, agents and independent contractors, and corporate directors. A person who is merely eligible for coverage under a group health plan but has not actually been covered is not a covered employee. Other classes of employees are covered employees under COBRA by virtue of the qualifying event that gives rise to their coverage-such as laid-off or striking employees or Medicare-eligible employees.\n\tNewborn or adopted children. Children born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee on or after the date of a qualifying event are considered qualified beneficiaries. (Reference 2 below)\n\tIf a covered employee who is also a qualified beneficiary does not elect COBRA coverage during the election period, then any child born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee on or after the date of the qualifying event is not considered a qualified beneficiary.(Reference 3 below)\n\tA child is \"placed for adoption\" for this purpose when a covered employee assumes and retains a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in anticipation of the child's adoption.(Reference 4 below)\n\tPart-time employees. Part-time employees are eligible for COBRA coverage if they were covered by the group health care plan and lose coverage due to a qualifying event If part-time employees' families are covered by the group health care plan and lose coverage due to a qualifying event, they may also be eligible for COBRA coverage.\n\tNonresident aliens. The term \"qualified beneficiary\" does not include an individual whose status as a covered employee is attributable to a period when he or she was a nonresident alien who received no earned U.S. source income from an employer. If the individual is not a qualified beneficiary as a result of this nonresident alien rule, the nonresident alien's spouse or dependent child is also not considered to be a qualified beneficiary. (Reference 5 below)\n\nOpen enrollment period\n\n\tIf an employer makes an open enrollment period available to non-COBRA beneficiaries, the same open enrollment period rights must be available to each COBRA qualified beneficiary.(Reference 6 below) An open enrollment period is a period during which an employee covered under a plan can choose to add or eliminate coverage of family members or can choose to be covered under another group health plan.\n\tIn addition to open enrollment periods, if the plan provides that new family members of active employees may become covered prior to the next open enrollment period, then the same right must be extended to a new family member of a COBRA beneficiary who joins the qualified beneficiary's family on or after the date of the qualifying event.(Reference 7 below)\n\nSame-sex marriage\n\tCOBRA benefits must be extended to the same-sex spouse of a covered employee, if the individuals are lawfully married under state law. For this purpose, a marriage is recognized as lawful if it took place in a state whose laws authorize same-sex marriage, even if the married couple lives in a state that does not recognize the validity of same-sex marriage.(Reference 8 below)\n\tTreatment of domestic partners. Health benefits offered to \"domestic partners\" after the breakup of a domestic partnership are not covered by COBRA However, employers may choose to offer continuation coverage to domestic partners of employees. Domestic partners are typically unrelated cohabiting adults, either heterosexual or homosexual. Note that for federal tax purposes, including COBRA coverage, the term \"marriage'' does not include a registered domestic partnership, civil union, or other similar formal relationship recognized under state law that is not called a marriage under the laws of that state.\n\tSimilarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries\n\t\tCOBRA provides that the type of coverage offered to qualified beneficiaries must be the type available to similarly situated beneficiaries with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred.(Reference 9 below)\n\t\t\"Similarly situated non-COBRA beneficiaries\" refers to the group of covered employees and their spouses or dependent children who:\n\t\t\t1. are receiving coverage under an employer or employee organization group health plan for a reason other than the right to coverage under the requirements of COBRA; and\n\t\t\t2. based on all of the facts and circumstances, are most similarly situated to the situation of the qualified beneficiary immediately before the qualifying event.(Reference 10 below)\n\nPersons wrongfully denied coverage\n\tA person who is wrongfully denied group health plan coverage in violation of an applicable law is to be treated as a qualified beneficiary.(Reference 11 below)\n\tSpecifically, if a person is denied or not offered group health plan coverage in violation of another law1 for purposes of COBRA, that person is considered to have had the coverage that was wrongfully denied or not offered and thus is considered to be a qualified beneficiary.\n \nREFERENCES \n\n1 Code Sec. 4980B(g) (1) (A) and (B).\n2 Code Sec. 4980(B) (g) (1) (A) and ERISA Sec.607(3), as amended by P.L. 104-191.\n3 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-3, Q/A\u00b7l(t).\n4 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-3, Q/A-l(g).\n5 Code Sec. 4980B(g) (1) (C).\n6 IRS Reg.\u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-4(c).\n7 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.4980B-5, Q/A-5(b) and (c).\n8 Rev.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 370 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Health Insurance Benefits\n    The type of protection afforded employees depends on the kinds of benefits being provided and the way in which they are paid. Payment may be through insurance premiums, via a trust or fund, or directly from the employer. Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage or incur costs such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nHealth insurance\n    Health insurance may be an umbrella for medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits, although each of these may also be separate plans or part of a cafeteria plan (see KB-1 Topic 2000). In addition, specific benefits such as mental health, substance abuse management, and prescription drugs, although often part of the health plan, are receiving separate attention due to escalating costs and societal concerns.\n    Medical. Medical coverage protects employees and their families from the total cost burden of the treatment of disease, illness, pregnancy and birth, or accidents and the prevention of disease. Medical. plans cover care delivered in hospitals, physicians' offices, and outpatient settings. Increasingly, the cost of the coverage is shared between employers and employees through employee contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n    Dental. Dental plans cover treatment and preventive care of the teeth, gums, and mouth. Coverage normally is provided through insured plans, self-insured plans, and health maintenance organizations. Plan design varies for certain types of care, such as orthodontia, preventive mali:i.tenance, cosmetic and voluntary procedures, and for coinsurance percentages (see KB-1 Topic 385).\n    Vision. A vision plan is not a common benefit, although certain injuries to eyes may be covered under most medical plans. A vision benefit plan could underwrite the cost of eye examinations, eyeglasses or contact lenses, and eye surgery. Some provide discounted prices for eyeglasses and examinations (see KB-1 Topic 390).\n    Hearing. Separate hearing benefit plans occur in a few union plans, but are a rarity. The plans provide payment for the diagnosis, fitting, and purchase of hearing aids and the treatment of hearing loss.\n    Mental health. Mental health coverage is usually part of the medical plan, although some companies have provided employee assistance programs (EAPs), preferred provider networks (PPOs), and managed care counselling to facilitate treatment outside the traditional medical plan. The benefit plan generally covers a certain number of days per year in an inpatient setting or pays a portion of the cost of outpatient treatment for a specified number of visits to a licensed provider.\n    Pointer: Annual and lifetime dollar limits can be no more restrictive than the limits for medical/surgical coverage. In the past, the Mental Health Parity Act contained a sunset provision. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the mental health parity provisions will no longer expire. In addition, the provisions have been enhanced and substance abuse coverage has been added. For more information, see r 400.\n    Substance abuse management. \u00b7treatment for substance abuse has also become a growth industry and a problem for employers. Inpatient detoxification is normally part of the medical plan or health maintenance organization coverage (see KB-1 Topic 405). However, ongoing outpatient therapy often is arranged on an exception basis by the insurer and the employer, using a case manager as an intermediary (see r 960).\n    Prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is part of most medical plans. Independent drug plans, however, have become a popular alternative for larger companies as an adjunct to the medical plan. These offer generic drug substitution at prices lower than available over the counter and are often done on a mail-order basis. Prescription drug plans can produce cost savings for beneficiaries undergoing long-term therapies to treat illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure (see r 380).\n \nPayment mechanisms\n    Benefits may be insured, partially insured, or self-insured. Further, they are funded, self-funded, or unfunded. This terminology refers to the manner in which an employer shares the risk of the cost of claims and pays for the coverage (see also KB-1 Topic 500).\n\nInsured benefits\n    Medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits may be fully insured through insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, health mainte\u00ad nance organizations, preferred provider networks, associations, or welfare funds.\n    Fully insured benefits. When benefits are fully insured, the insurer estimates the total claim liability for all employees and beneficiaries and adds the projected cost for expenses such as administration, marketing, accounting reserves and trend to develop a cost for the plan year. This estimate represents the total cost for the employer for the plan year. The insurer absorbs any charges above the amount and profit when the total costs are below the estimate. The employer remits a premium on a monthly basis to the insurer.\n    Partially insured arrangement. Under a partially insured arrangement, a portion of estimated claims is insured, usually under stop loss policies, while the rest of the claims are paid on a self-insured basis.\n    Self-insured benefits. An employer that self-insures reimburses the claim payer for claims as they come due or on a delayed basis under agreement with the claim payer. In a self-insured arrangement, the employer assumes the responsibility for the entire cost of paying and processing the claims. A company contracting with an outside provider, such as a managed care vendor or mail-order drug supplier, may negotiate a contract involving minimal risk on either party and pay a charge based on the number of participants per month or on a formula representing the actual costs.\n\nFunding\n    Regardless of whether benefits are provided through insurance or self-insurance, the employer may fully or partially fund the benefits. A fully funded plan involves setting aside anticipated claim costs on a regular basis, sometimes using a trust. An unfunded plan would deduct claim costs from the general assets of the employer on an as-needed basis, with no advance reserving or budgeting. Sometimes funding arrangements are negotiated that involve a delay in remitting payment, subject to an interest charge.\n    A smaller employer is more likely to fully insure and fully fund a welfare benefit program, while larger companies tend to self-insure and self-fund, often with some form of stop-loss insurance as protection against catastrophic claims (see KB-1 Topic 470).\n \nEmployee cost participation\n    Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of insurance. In addition, employees often share in the cost of benefits through deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments (see KB-1 Topic 375).\n\nFor more information ...\n    Employer funding of health plans is discussed at KB-1 Topic 455.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Introduction to Medical Expense Benefits - Cost Containment\n\n\tBetween 1970 and today, the average annual increases in the cost of medical care were approximately twice the average annual increases in the consumer price index. No single factor accounts for these increases. Rather, it was a combination of the following reasons:\n\u2022 technological advances. Many exciting technological advances took place. Such techniques as CAT scans, MRIs, fetal monitoring, and organ transplants are now saving numerous lives. As miraculous as many of these techniques are, they are also very expensive. Technological advances can also prolong the life of the terminally ill and increase associated medical expenses.\n\u2022 increasing malpractice suits. The providers of care were much more likely to be sued than in the past, and malpractice awards outpaced the general rate of inflation. This development resulted in higher malpractice insurance premiums, a cost that is ultimately passed on to consumers. The increase in malpractice suits also led to an increase in defensive medicine, with routine tests likely to be performed more often.\n\u2022 design of medical expense plans. Many medical expense plans provided first-dollar coverage or had low out-of-pocket costs for many health care services. There was often little incentive for patients to avoid the most expensive forms of treatment.\n\u2022 increases in mandates by the states that require insurance contracts to provide coverage for certain types of medical care and for treatment by certain types of providers. In some cases, these mandates transfer costs that persons were already paying to insurance companies. However, they also increase the overall utilization of certain types of care, which results in increased costs.\n\u2022 increases in third-party payments. Private health insurers or the government paid a growing portion of the country's health care expenditures. The expansion of coverage and benefits shielded providers and patients from the true cost of health care.\n\u2022 underutilization of medical facilities. The United States had an overabundance of hospital beds, which are expensive to maintain. This situation still exists. A surplus of physicians also began to develop, particularly specialists. An oversupply of physicians tends to drive up the average costs of medical procedures so that physicians' average income does not decrease. Also, more recently, a shortage of primary care physicians is developing. This forces persons to obtain more expensive care with specialists and in emergency rooms.\n\u2022 AIDS. The increase in the number of AIDS cases resulted in increasing costs to employers. Costs in excess of $100,000 for an employee with AIDS are not unusual.\n\u2022 an aging population. The incidence of illness increases with age. Current demographics indicate that this trend will be a source of cost increases for several years to come.\n\tDuring the period from 1994 to 1996, several factors caused the cost of medical expense coverage to remain uncharacteristically stable, particularly for managed care plans. Many providers of medical services and medical expense plans were reluctant to raise costs while the health care proposal of the Clinton administration was being debated. In addition, managed care plans were holding down premiums while actively increasing enrollments.\n\tHowever, the late 1990s started to see significant increases in health care costs, particularly because of skyrocketing costs for prescription drugs. There is a feeling among benefit consultants that managed care plans have saturated the market to the point that savings resulting from additional employees moving to managed care plans will be modest. There is also an interesting trend occurring among medical providers. The large number of mergers of hospitals and other providers of medical services in many parts of the country may in fact shift the balance of bargaining power to these providers from managed care plans and other buyers of medical services. In addition, costs will increase somewhat because of federal and state legislation that continues to mandate benefits.\n\tIncreasing health care costs have become the concern of almost everyone-government, labor, employers, and consumers. Measures employers use include:\n\u2022 benefit plan design\n\u2022 alternative providers\n\u2022 alternative funding methods\n\u2022 claims review\n\u2022 health education and preventive care\n\u2022 encouragement of external cost-control systems\n\u2022 managed care\n\u2022 consumer-directed plans\n\nBenefit Plan Design\n\tNumerous design features of a medical expense plan can control costs. These have traditionally been in the form of contractual provisions that shift costs to employees. Examples are\n\u2022 deductibles\n\u2022 coinsurance\n\u2022 copayments\n\u2022 exclusions and limitations\n\u2022 maximum benefits\n\tIn recent years, many design features have been aimed at reducing costs rather than shifting them. In fact, benefit plans are often structured to provide a higher level of benefits if less costly alternatives are used. Examples of these cost-containment features are\n\u2022 preadmission testing\n\u2022 second surgical opinions\n\u2022 coordination of benefits\n\u2022 the use of alternatives to hospitals (such as skilled-nursing facilities, home health care, hospice care, birthing centers, and ambulatory care centers). In addition, there is increasing use by large employers of on-site health centers. Their presence decreases employee use of more expensive emergency rooms and urgent care centers. The also may be a convenient source of preventive care, such as flu shots, and for monitoring chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma.\n\u2022 the use of health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, and other consumer-directed medical expense plans. These plans typically involve the use of high-deductible medical expense policies.\n\nAlternative Providers\n\tThe use of HMOs and PPOs has been popular for some years as a cost-containment method. These methods have now been joined by point-of-service plans, usually designed as variations of HMOs.\n\nAlternative Funding Methods\n\tEmployers are increasingly turning to funding methods that are alternatives to the traditional insurance company plan or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan.\n\nClaims Review\n\tThere is no doubt that claims review can generate substantial cost savings. In general, the employer does not do this review. Rather, the provider of medical expense benefits, a third-party administrator, or some independent outside organization performs this function. At a minimum, claims should be reviewed for patient eligibility, eligibility of the services provided, duplicate policies, and charges that are in excess of usual, customary, and reasonable amounts. Many medical expense plans routinely audit hospital bills, particularly those that exceed some stipulated amount, such as $5,000 or $10,000. They check for errors in such items as length of stay, services performed, and billed charges. Many insurance companies have found that each dollar spent on this type of review results in two or three dollars of savings.\n\tGood claims review should also look at ongoing claims. For example, is hospice care or home health care a less expensive alternative to hospitalization? Many providers of medical expense benefits pay for such alternative forms of treatment even if the medical expense plan does not cover them as long as their cost is lower than the cost of continued hospitalization.\n\nHealth Education and Preventive Care\n\tPersons who lead healthy lifestyles tend to have fewer medical bills, particularly at younger ages. Healthier employees save an employer money by taking fewer sick days and having fewer disability claims. For these reasons, employers are increasingly establishing wellness programs and employee-assistance plans. With increasing health awareness among the general population, the existence of these programs also has a positive side effect-the improvement of employee morale.\n\tUse of health coaches and advocates is also increasing. These medical professionals-often registered nurses-provide employees with individualized advice about treatment and suggest questions to ask providers of care. In some cases, a covered person contacts a health coach for advice. In other cases, the coaches take a more proactive approach and contact persons who have had specific types of claims. For example, a coach may contact a diabetic every few months to make sure he or she is following up on the treatment and medical tests to prevent more severe medical problems.\n\tIn addition, more employers are paying for certain types of preventive care in full, particularly when the cost of such care is shown to be more than offset by a reduction in future medical expenses. Since a main objective of the Affordable Care Act is preventive care these benefits are mandated as essential health benefits and not only must be covered, but covered with no patient cost-sharing.\n\nEncouragement of External Cost-Control Systems\n\tAlthough a certain degree of cost containment is within the control of employers, the proper control of costs is an ongoing process that requires participation by consumers (both employers and individuals), government, and the providers of health care services. Many agencies and committees of the Department of Health and Human Services carry out these activities at the federal level. This government department has the primary responsibility for identifying health care needs, monitoring resources, establishing priorities, recommending courses of action, and overseeing laws that pertain to health care.\n\tAt the state and local level, many employers are active in coalitions whose purpose is to control costs and improve the quality of health care. These groups- which may also involve unions, providers of health care, insurance companies, and regulators- are often catalysts for legislation, such as laws authorizing PPOs and establishing hospital budget-review programs. Some coalitions act as purchasing groups to negotiate lower-cost coverage for members. For example, one coalition consists of several large corporations and offers a uniform health plan to the employees of its members. The plan is self-funded by the coalition and utilizes the services of several thousand primary care physicians and specialists. Another coalition, an example of a different approach, represents many small employers. The coalition negotiates with providers of medical expense coverage and offers its members a choice of several different group plans. Still other coalitions negotiate prescription drug benefits, employee assistance plans, vision benefits, and dental benefits for member employers.\n\nManaged Care\n\tFor many years, the buzzword with respect to cost containment has been managed care. In a general sense, the term includes any medical expense plan that attempts to contain costs by controlling the behavior of participants. However, in practice many persons use the term to mean different things. At one extreme are traditional plans that require second opinions and/or hospital precertification. At the other extreme are HMOs and PPOs that limit a participant's choice of medical providers, negotiate provider fees, and manage utilization of medical services.\n\tManaged care plans have evolved over the last few years. Today, it is generally felt that a true managed care plan should have five basic characteristics:\n\u2022 controlled access to providers. It is difficult to control costs if participants have unrestricted access to physicians and hospitals. Managed care plans attempt to encourage or force participants to use specified providers. Because a major portion of medical expenses results from referrals to specialists, managed care plans tend to use primary care physicians as gatekeepers to determine the necessity and appropriateness of specialty care. By limiting the number of providers, managed care plans are better able to control costs by negotiating provider fees.\n\u2022 comprehensive utilization management. Successful managed care plans perform utilization review at all levels. This involves reviewing a case to determine the type of treatment necessary, monitoring ongoing care, and reviewing the appropriateness and success of treatment after patients receive it.\n\u2022 preventive care. Managed care plans encourage preventive care and the attainment of healthier lifestyles.\n\u2022 risk sharing. Managed care plans are most successful if providers share in the financial consequences of medical decisions. Newer managed care plans have contractual guarantees to encourage cost-effective care. For example, a physician who minimizes diagnostic tests may receive a bonus. Ideally, such an arrangement will eliminate unnecessary tests, not discourage tests that providers should order.\n\u2022 high-quality care. A managed care plan is not well received nor often selected by participants if there is a perception of inferior or inconvenient medical care. In the past, too little attention was paid to this aspect of cost containment. Newer managed care plans not only select providers more carefully but also monitor the quality of care on a continuing basis.\n\tThere seems to be a reasonable consensus among employers and benefit specialists that there is a negative correlation between benefit costs and the degree of managed care-that is, the greater the degree of managed care, the lower the cost. For example, studies generally rank benefit plans in the following order (from highest to lowest) with respect to annual benefit costs:\n\u2022 traditional insurance company and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans without utilization management\n\u2022 traditional insurance company and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans with utilization management\n\u2022  PPOs\n\u2022 point-of-service plans\n\u2022 independent practice association HMOs closed-panel HMOs\n\tIt is interesting to note that the degree of managed care increases as one goes down the list. There also seems to be a high correlation between annual benefit costs and the rate of cost increases. For example, the cost of traditional benefit plans has been increasing recently at an annual rate in excess of the annual increase in cost for closed-panel HMOs.\n\nConsumer-Directed Health Care\n\tThe early part of this decade has seen considerable interest in the concept of consumer-directed health care. With this approach, employees are put in charge of managing the health care dollars their employers provide. It exposes employees to the true cost of care and involves them in keeping health care expenditures under control.\n\n\n\n"

(Reference 1 below) Insurers also are required to \"prominently\" post information regarding premium increases on their websites.\n   \tHHS, again in conjunction with the states, is required to monitor premium increases of health insurance coverage offered both inside and outside the Ameri\u00ad can Health Benefit Exchange (Exchange) (see KB-1 Topic 860). (Reference 2 below)\n   \tIn determining whether to exercise its option to permit large employers to participate in the Exchange, a state must consider any excess of premium growth outside the Exchange as compared to the rate of such growth inside the Exchange.\n   \tRate review process. A new rate process in HHS regulations requires health insurers to submit to the HHS and the applicable state a justification for an \"unreasonable\" premium increase prior to the implementation of the increase. (Reference 3 below)\n   \tReasonable increase does not exceed 15 percent. HHS concludes that premium rate increases under 15 percent are reasonable. Thus, for rate increases filed for policy or plan years beginning in 2019, in a state that does not require rate increases to be filed, the threshold for whether rates are subject to review would be whether the average weighted increase in the rate filing, alone or in combination with prior increases in the preceding 12 month period, is 15 percent or more. (Reference 4 below) The default threshold for rate increases subject to review was 10 percent prior to 2019.\n   \tDisclosure notices. Related to the rate increase regulations are proposed consumer disclosure notices, which include an easy-to-understand breakdown of an insurer's proposed rate increase-helping make sure that, as the rate increase is being reviewed, consumers who would be affected by the increase have access to information about their insurance rates. The notices provide basic information about health insurance rate increases and their review, as well as detailed information about the specific increase that an insurer has proposed. Consumers also will be able to see what the insurance company believes is driving the increase in premiums and how much of the increase would go to medical services, profits, and administrative expenses.\n\tThe proposed notices require health insurers to advise consumers of the insurer's products affected by the rate increase, the average dollar increase and monthly rate that would result from the proposed rate adjustment, range of percentage increase depending on individual factors, when the new rate would be effective, and how many people in the state would be affected.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 515 - Health Benefits - Health Plan Administration - Benefit Denial Procedures\n\n   There are many reasons why a claim might be denied. For example, the services may not be covered by the benefit plan. Another common reason for denial is that the treatment is experimental. The plan maximum benefit level may have been reached. The individual may not be eligible under the plan because he or she has not worked for the employer for the required number of days. Denial can also occur when the claimant has a preexisting condition that precludes coverage until a specified exclusion period has passed.\n   If a claim is denied. When a claim is denied, the plan administrator must provide the claimant with the reasons for denial in easy-to-understand language. The plan administrator must explain the information needed to perfect the claim, cite the plan provisions on which the denial was based, and detail the procedure for appealing the claim decision (Reference 1 below).\n   Ultimately, a participant may initiate a lawsuit to decide whether the plan should pay a claim. Depending on the amount of discretion accorded the administrator in interpreting a claim, the court could decide whether the denial of benefits constituted an abuse of discretion or review the facts de novo and make a decision on coverage (see KB-1 Topic 55).\n   For a detailed discussion of the benefit claims procedure, see KB-1 Topic 45.\n\nSupreme Court decisions\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has held that ERISA did not preempt an Illinois law allowing for an independent external review to resolve disputes over the \"medical necessity\" of medical treatments that a patient's primary care doctor has recommended (Reference 3 below). The end result of the Court's decision is that state independent review laws will control, as long as they don't create a new cause of action or provide a remedy beyond the benefits otherwise available under a plan.\n   The Supreme Court also has held that a Texas state law, the Texas Health Care Liability Act (fHCLA), was preempted by ERISA where two HMO participants sought recovery under the THCLA for their HMOs' refusal to provide certain treatment and services recommended by their doctors. The claims were only to rectify wrongful benefits denials; they did not arise independently of ERISA or the plans' terms. Because the claims were pure eligibility decisions, ERISA, not state law, provided the exclusive remedy (Reference 4 below).\n \nInterpretation of eligible expenses\n   In the process of paying or denying a claim, the administrator should differentiate expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from those that are not allowed under the plan. While many employers adopt many of the same plan provisions and follow state or federal laws that apply to the plans, each employer does have discretion in designing the welfare benefit plan that it offers to employees. Therefore, the claim payer must be able to identify each employer's plan and the specific provisions of the plan to identify eligible expenses.\n   Just because a charge is eligible for payment does not mean that the plan will reimburse for it. Charges that are not allowed should neither be reimbursed nor applied toward satisfaction of the deductible.\n   Pointer: The plan document should specify and define noncovered expenses so that the administrator, utilization reviewers, the employer, and participants can all clearly understand types of charges that the plan will not allow.\n   Payments that were wrongfully made by an administrator may be recovered under ERISA and claims fraudulently submitted may be denied payment.\n\nFor more information...\n   Claim procedure requirements under ERISA are discussed at KB-1 Topic 45.\n   An ERISA-required review after a benefit denial is analyzed at KB-1 Topic 50.\n   Claim procedure requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are discussed at KB-1 Topic 934.\n\nFor more information ...\n   A discussion of possible reasons for denial of a medical claim is located at KB-1 Topic 10,425 of EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MANAGEMENT.\n \nREFERENCES\n \n1 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2560.503-1(f) and (g).\n3 Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 370 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Health Insurance Benefits\n    The type of protection afforded employees depends on the kinds of benefits being provided and the way in which they are paid. Payment may be through insurance premiums, via a trust or fund, or directly from the employer. Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage or incur costs such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nHealth insurance\n    Health insurance may be an umbrella for medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits, although each of these may also be separate plans or part of a cafeteria plan (see KB-1 Topic 2000). In addition, specific benefits such as mental health, substance abuse management, and prescription drugs, although often part of the health plan, are receiving separate attention due to escalating costs and societal concerns.\n    Medical. Medical coverage protects employees and their families from the total cost burden of the treatment of disease, illness, pregnancy and birth, or accidents and the prevention of disease. Medical. plans cover care delivered in hospitals, physicians' offices, and outpatient settings. Increasingly, the cost of the coverage is shared between employers and employees through employee contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n    Dental. Dental plans cover treatment and preventive care of the teeth, gums, and mouth. Coverage normally is provided through insured plans, self-insured plans, and health maintenance organizations. Plan design varies for certain types of care, such as orthodontia, preventive mali:i.tenance, cosmetic and voluntary procedures, and for coinsurance percentages (see KB-1 Topic 385).\n    Vision. A vision plan is not a common benefit, although certain injuries to eyes may be covered under most medical plans. A vision benefit plan could underwrite the cost of eye examinations, eyeglasses or contact lenses, and eye surgery. Some provide discounted prices for eyeglasses and examinations (see KB-1 Topic 390).\n    Hearing. Separate hearing benefit plans occur in a few union plans, but are a rarity. The plans provide payment for the diagnosis, fitting, and purchase of hearing aids and the treatment of hearing loss.\n    Mental health. Mental health coverage is usually part of the medical plan, although some companies have provided employee assistance programs (EAPs), preferred provider networks (PPOs), and managed care counselling to facilitate treatment outside the traditional medical plan. The benefit plan generally covers a certain number of days per year in an inpatient setting or pays a portion of the cost of outpatient treatment for a specified number of visits to a licensed provider.\n    Pointer: Annual and lifetime dollar limits can be no more restrictive than the limits for medical/surgical coverage. In the past, the Mental Health Parity Act contained a sunset provision. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the mental health parity provisions will no longer expire. In addition, the provisions have been enhanced and substance abuse coverage has been added. For more information, see r 400.\n    Substance abuse management. \u00b7treatment for substance abuse has also become a growth industry and a problem for employers. Inpatient detoxification is normally part of the medical plan or health maintenance organization coverage (see KB-1 Topic 405). However, ongoing outpatient therapy often is arranged on an exception basis by the insurer and the employer, using a case manager as an intermediary (see r 960).\n    Prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is part of most medical plans. Independent drug plans, however, have become a popular alternative for larger companies as an adjunct to the medical plan. These offer generic drug substitution at prices lower than available over the counter and are often done on a mail-order basis. Prescription drug plans can produce cost savings for beneficiaries undergoing long-term therapies to treat illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure (see r 380).\n \nPayment mechanisms\n    Benefits may be insured, partially insured, or self-insured. Further, they are funded, self-funded, or unfunded. This terminology refers to the manner in which an employer shares the risk of the cost of claims and pays for the coverage (see also KB-1 Topic 500).\n\nInsured benefits\n    Medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits may be fully insured through insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, health mainte\u00ad nance organizations, preferred provider networks, associations, or welfare funds.\n    Fully insured benefits. When benefits are fully insured, the insurer estimates the total claim liability for all employees and beneficiaries and adds the projected cost for expenses such as administration, marketing, accounting reserves and trend to develop a cost for the plan year. This estimate represents the total cost for the employer for the plan year. The insurer absorbs any charges above the amount and profit when the total costs are below the estimate. The employer remits a premium on a monthly basis to the insurer.\n    Partially insured arrangement. Under a partially insured arrangement, a portion of estimated claims is insured, usually under stop loss policies, while the rest of the claims are paid on a self-insured basis.\n    Self-insured benefits. An employer that self-insures reimburses the claim payer for claims as they come due or on a delayed basis under agreement with the claim payer. In a self-insured arrangement, the employer assumes the responsibility for the entire cost of paying and processing the claims. A company contracting with an outside provider, such as a managed care vendor or mail-order drug supplier, may negotiate a contract involving minimal risk on either party and pay a charge based on the number of participants per month or on a formula representing the actual costs.\n\nFunding\n    Regardless of whether benefits are provided through insurance or self-insurance, the employer may fully or partially fund the benefits. A fully funded plan involves setting aside anticipated claim costs on a regular basis, sometimes using a trust. An unfunded plan would deduct claim costs from the general assets of the employer on an as-needed basis, with no advance reserving or budgeting. Sometimes funding arrangements are negotiated that involve a delay in remitting payment, subject to an interest charge.\n    A smaller employer is more likely to fully insure and fully fund a welfare benefit program, while larger companies tend to self-insure and self-fund, often with some form of stop-loss insurance as protection against catastrophic claims (see KB-1 Topic 470).\n \nEmployee cost participation\n    Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of insurance. In addition, employees often share in the cost of benefits through deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments (see KB-1 Topic 375).\n\nFor more information ...\n    Employer funding of health plans is discussed at KB-1 Topic 455.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 888 - Health Care Reform - Group Market Rules - Required Preventive Health Services Coverage\n\n    Group health plans and health insurance issuers providing group or individual health plans are required to provide coverage, without cost-sharing, for certain preventive services, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). This provision does not apply to grandfathered health plans (see KB-1 Topic 842).\n    Non-grandfathered group health plans and issuers must provide coverage (without any cost sharing) for certain preventive health services including, at minimum (Reference 1 below):\n1. evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of A or B in the current recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (Reference 2 below);\n2. immunizations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n3. for infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA);\n4. with respect to women, any additional preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the HRSA USPSTF recommendations for mammography screening that were issued in 2009 which recommended routine screening only for women age 50 and older, will not be considered current. Instead, those issued in 2002, which recommended earlier screening starting at age 40, will be used (Reference 3 below).\n    For these services, plans presumably will rely on previous recommendations (Reference 4 below).\n    Use of aspirin. The USPSTF recommends the use of aspirin for certain men and women when the potential benefit due to a reduction in myocardial infarctions outweighs the potential harm. Aspirin is generally available over-the-counter (OTC). Aspirin and other OTC-recommended items and services must be covered without cost sharing only when prescribed by a health care provider (Reference 5 below).\n    Colonoscopy. Another USPSTF recommendation is a colonoscopy as a screening procedure. A plan or issuer may not impose cost sharing with respect to a required consultation prior to a colonoscopy screening procedure if the attending provider determines that the pre-procedure consultation would be medically appropriate for the individual, because the pre-procedure consultation is an integral part of the colonoscopy. In addition, the plan or issuer is required to cover any pathology exam on a polyp biopsy without cost sharing (Reference 6 below). A plan or issuer may not impose cost sharing with respect to a polyp removal during a colonoscopy performed as a screening procedure. On the other hand, a plan or issuer may impose cost sharing for a treatment that is not a recommended preventive service, even if the treatment results from a recommended preventive service (Reference 7 below).\n    BRCA testing. In addition, the USPSTF recommendation for genetic counseling and evaluation for routine breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) testing includes both genetic counseling and BRCA testing, if appropriate, for a woman as determined by her health care provider (Reference 8 below). The USPSTF recommends with a \"B\" rating to \"screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA 1 or BRCA 2). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing.\" As such, women found to be at increased risk using a screening tool designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk of having a potentially harmful gene mutation must receive coverage without cost sharing for genetic counseling, and, if indicated, testing for harmful BRCA mutations. This is true regardless of whether the woman has previously been diagnosed with cancer, as long as she is not currently symptomatic of or receiving active treatment for breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer (Reference 9 below).\n    Breast cancer medications. In September 2013, the USPTF recommended that physicians offer risk-reducing medications to women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and at low risk for adverse medication effects. In response to the USPTF recommendation, EBSA FAQs stipulate that, for plan or policy years beginning on or after September 24, 2014, both non-grandfathered group health plans and non-grandfathered health insurance coverage offered in the individual or group market must cover breast cancer risk-reducing medications such as tamoxifen or faloxifene without cost sharing subject to reasonable medical management. This requirement does not apply to grandfathered health plans (Reference 10 below).\n    Tobacco use. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians ask all adults about tobacco use and provide tobacco cessation interventions for those who use tobacco products. A group health plan or health insurance issuer will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement to cover tobacco use counseling and interventions, if, for example, the plan or issuer covers without cost-sharing (Reference 11 below):\n1. screening for tobacco use, and,\n2. for those who use tobacco products, at least two tobacco cessation attempts per year. For this purpose, covering a cessation attempt includes coverage for:\n\u25a1 four tobacco cessation counseling sessions of at least 10 minutes each (including telephone counseling, group counseling and individual counseling) without prior authorization, and\n\u25a1 all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tobacco cessation medications (including both prescription and over-the-counter medications) for a 90-day treatment regimen when prescribed by a health care provider without prior authorization.\n    Weight management. Non-grandfathered plans and issuers must cover, without cost sharing, screening for obesity in adults. In addition to such screening, the USPSTF currently recommends, for adult patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher, intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for weight management. The recommendation specifies that intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions include, for example, the following:\n\u25a1 group and individual sessions of high intensity (12 to 26 sessions in a year),\n\u25a1 behavioral management activities, such as weight-loss goals,\n\u25a1 improving diet or nutrition and increasing physical activity,\n\u25a1 addressing barriers to change,\n\u25a1 self-monitoring, and\n\u25a1 strategizing how to maintain lifestyle changes (Reference 12 below).\n    Women's services. Pursuant to HRSA guidelines, new health plans must include the following preventive services for women without cost sharing (Reference 13 below):\n\u25a1 screening for gestational diabetes;\n\u25a1 human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as part of cervical cancer screening for women who are older than age 30;\n\u25a1 counseling on sexually transmitted infections;\n\u25a1 counseling and screening for HIV;\n\u25a1 contraceptive methods and counseling to prevent unintended pregnancies;\n\u25a1 lactation counseling and equipment to promote breastfeeding;\n\u25a1 screening and counseling to detect and prevent interpersonal and domestic violence; and\n\u25a1 yearly well-woman preventive care visits to obtain recommended preventive services.\n    Contraception coverage. Health care plans must cover, without cost sharing, the full range of FDA-approved methods for contraception. There are currently 18 distinct methods of contraception for women. While all 18 contraceptive methods must be made available without cost-sharing, health plans are allowed to use reasonable medical management techniques and impose cost-sharing to encourage the use of specific services or FDA-approved items within the chosen contraceptive method. For example, a plan may discourage use of brand name pharmacy items over generic pharmacy items through the imposition of cost sharing. In addition, if multiple services and FDA-approved items within a contraceptive method are medically appropriate for an individual, the plan may use reasonable medical management techniques to determine which specific products to cover without cost sharing. However, the plan must defer to an individual's attending provider and if the provider recommends a particular item, the plan must cover the recommended item without cost sharing (Reference 14 below).\n    Contraceptive methods that are generally available over the counter are only included if the method is both FDA-approved and prescribed for a woman by her health care provider. The HRSA Guidelines do not include contraception for men (Reference 15 below).\n    Exemptions from contraception coverage. Effective January 14, 2019, final regulations exempt objecting nongovernment employers from the general requirement to provide contraceptive coverage at no cost to participants in their group health plans.\n    The rules provide that any nongovernment employer that has religious or moral objections to providing coverage for some or all forms of birth control can simply not provide the coverage. These rules also apply to colleges and universities providing student health insurance coverage. Although there has been a limited accommodation for employers that have a religious objection, the exemption on the basis of a moral objection is entirely new.\n    Caution: In July 2019, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Pennsylvania and New Jersey are likely to succeed in proving that the agencies did not follow the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that the contraceptive exemption regulations are not authorized under the ACA or required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). The court also concluded that the states will suffer a concrete and imminent financial injury from the increased use of state-funded services were the regulations to go into effect, and that an injunction would redress that injury. Therefore, it affirmed the district court's order preliminarily enjoining the rules' enforcement nationwide (Reference 16 below).\n    In October 2019, the Little Sisters of the Poor filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court to review the Third Circuit's decision. As we go to press, the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether it will hear the case.\n    The religious exemption is open to any nongovernment employer, including both nonprofit and for-profit employers. The same holds true for the moral exemption, except the religious exemption is available for publicly traded employers, but the moral objection is not. The government expects corporations to express their objections through the normal state law rules of corporate governance (Reference 17 below).\n    Objecting entities for purposes of religious exemption. The religious exemption applies to the extent that an entity objects, based on its sincerely held religious beliefs, to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) for coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, or a plan, issuer, or third party administrator that provides or arranges such coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services (Reference 18 below).\n    Guidelines issued under HHS Reg. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by the HRSA must not provide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments for contraceptive services with respect to a group health plan established or maintained by an objecting organization, or health insurance coverage offered or arranged by an objecting organization. Thus, the HRSA will exempt from any guidelines' requirements that relate to the provision of contraceptive services a group health plan (and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan) to the extent the non-governmental plan sponsor objects to such coverage. Such non\u00adgovernmental plan sponsors include, but are not limited to, the following entities (Reference 19 below):\n\u25a1 churches, integrated auxiliaries, and religious orders with religious objections;\n\u25a1 nonprofit organizations with religious or moral objections;\n\u25a1 for-profit entities that are not publicly traded, with religious or moral objections;\n\u25a1 for-profit entities that are publicly traded, with religious objections;\n\u25a1 other nongovernmental employers with religious objections;\n\u25a1 nongovernmental institutions of higher education with religious or moral objections;\n\u25a1 individuals with religious or moral objections, with employer sponsored or individual market coverage, where the plan sponsor and/or issuer (as applicable) are willing to offer them a plan omitting contraceptive coverage to which they object; and\n\u25a1 issuers with religious or moral objections, to the extent they provide coverage to a plan sponsor or individual that is also exempt.\n    The exemption is not available for government entities.\n    Objecting entities for purposes of moral exemption. The moral exemption applies to the extent that an entity objects to its establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging (as applicable) coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services, or for a plan, issuer, or third party administrator that provides or arranges such coverage or payments, based on its sincerely held moral convictions (Reference 20 below).\n    Guidelines issued under HHS Reg. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by the HRSA must not provide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments for contraceptive services with respect to a group health plan established or maintained by an objecting organization, or health insurance coverage offered or arranged by an objecting organization. Thus, the HRSA will exempt from any guidelines' requirements that relate to the provision of contraceptive services a group health plan (and health insurance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan) to the extent the non-governmental plan sponsor objects to such coverage. Such non\u00adgovernmental plan sponsors include, but are not limited to, the following entities (Reference 21 below):\n\u25a1 a nonprofit organization, or\n\u25a1 a for-profit entity that has no publicly traded ownership interests.\n    Institutions of higher education (with respect to their arrangement of student health coverage) that object to providing contraception coverage also qualify for the moral exemption.\n    Optional accommodation. The regulations provide a voluntary accommodation process as an option for eligible organizations (i.e., employers). An eligible organization is an organization that meets the following criteria (Reference 22 below):\n\u25a1 the  organization is an objecting entity described in HHS Reg. 147.132(a)(1)(i) or (ii); (see Objecting entities above),\n\u25a1 notwithstanding its exempt status, the organization voluntarily seeks to be considered an eligible organization to invoke the optional accommodation, and\n\u25a1 the organization self-certifies in the form and manner specified by the HHS Secretary or provides notice to the Secretary as required by the regulations.\n    To qualify as an eligible organization, the organization must make such self\u00adcertification or notice available for examination upon request by the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person authorized to make the certification or provide the notice on behalf of the organization, and must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements under ERISA Sec. 107. An eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process, and its issuer must provide participants and beneficiaries written notice of such revocation as specified in HHS guidance.\n    Accommodation process. A group health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization that provides benefits through one or more group health insurance issuers (or on a self-insured basis) may voluntarily elect an optional accommodation under which its health insurance issuer(s) (or third party administrator) will provide payments for all or a subset of contraceptive services for one or more plan years. To invoke the optional accommodation process (Reference 23 below):\n\u25a1 the eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more health insurance issuers (or third party administrators) and\n\u25a1 the eligible organization must provide either a copy of the self-certification to each issuer providing coverage in connection with the plan or a notice to the HHS Secretary it is an eligible organization and of its objection to coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services.\n    The self-certification (EBSA Form 700) is accessible at https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/laws-and-regulations/laws/affordable-care-act/for-employers-and-advisers/ebsa-form-700-revised.pdf.\n    When a self-certification is provided directly to an issuer, the issuer has sole responsibility for providing such coverage.\n    When a notice is provided to the HHS Secretary, the notice must include:\n\u25a1 the name of the eligible organization,\n\u25a1 a statement that it objects to coverage of some or all contraceptive services (including an identification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization objects, if applicable) but that it would like to elect the optional accommodation process,\n\u25a1 the plan name and type (that is, whether it is a student health insurance plan within the meaning of HHS Reg. \u00a7147.145(a) or a church plan within the meaning of ERISA Sec.3(33), and\n\u25a1 the name and contact information for any of the plan's health insurance issuers (or third party administrators).\n    Insured group health plans. If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or the notification from HHS and does not have an objection to providing the contraceptive services identified in the self-certification or the notification from HHS, then the issuer will provide payments for contraceptive services as follows (Reference 24 below):\n\u25a1 The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan and provide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered for plan participants and beneficiaries for so long as they remain enrolled in the plan.\n\u25a1 With respect to payments for contraceptive services, the issuer may not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\n    The issuer must segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organ\u00ad ization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.\n    Self-insured group health plans. If a third party administrator receives a copy of the self-certification from an eligible organization or a notification and is willing to enter into or remain in a contractual relationship with the eligible organization or its plan to provide administrative services for the plan, then the third party administrator will provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services, using one of the following methods (Reference 25 below):\n\u25a1 Provide payments for the contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries without imposing any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries; or\n\u25a1 Arrange for an issuer or other entity to provide payments for contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries without imposing any cost\u00ad sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\n    If a third party administrator provides or arranges payments for contraceptive services, the costs of providing or arranging such payments may be reimbursed through an adjustment to the Federally facilitated Exchange user fee for a participating issuer (Reference 26 below).\n    Notice of availability of separate payments for services. For each plan year to which the optional accommodation is to apply, an issuer (and a third party administrator) must provide to plan participants and beneficiaries written notice of the availability of separate payments for contraceptive services contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), but separate from, any application materials distributed in connection with enrollment (or reenrollment) in group health coverage that is effective beginning on the first day of each applicable plan year (Reference 27 below). The notice must specify that the eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits, but that the third party administrator or issuer, as applicable, provides or arranges separate payments for contraceptive services, and must provide contact information for questions and complaints. The following model language, or substantially similar language, may be used to satisfy the notice requirement: Your employer has certified that your group health plan qualifies for an accommodation with respect to the Federal requirement to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive services for women, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing. This means that your employer will not contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. Instead, [name of third party administrator/health insurance issuer] will provide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services that you use, without cost sharing and at no other cost, for so long as you are enrolled in your group health plan. Your employer will not administer or fund these payments. If you have any questions about this notice, contact [contact information for third party administrator/health insurance issuer].\n    Lactation support. In addition to contraception coverage, the HRSA Guide\u00ad lines specifically incorporate comprehensive prenatal and postnatal lactation support, counseling, and equipment rental. Accordingly, the items and services described in the HRSA Guidelines are required to be covered in accordance with the requirements of the interim final regulations (that is, without cost sharing, subject to reasonable medical management, which may include purchase instead of rental of equipment). Coverage of comprehensive lactation support and counseling and costs of renting or purchasing breastfeeding equipment extends for the duration of breastfeeding (Reference 28 below). Plans and issuers are not permitted to require individuals to obtain breastfeeding equipment within a specified time period (for example, within 6 months of delivery) in order for the breastfeeding equipment to be covered without cost sharing (Reference 29 below).\n    Plans and issuers are required to provide a list of the lactation counseling providers within the network. Although the preventive services requirements do not include specific disclosure requirements, provisions of other applicable laws require disclosure of lactation counseling providers available under the plan or coverage. Group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance coverage must provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) that includes an Internet address (or other contact information) for obtaining a list of the network providers.\n    In addition, group health plans subject to ERISA must provide a Summary Plan Description (SPD) that describes provisions governing the use of network providers, the composition bf the provider network, and whether, and under what circumstances, coverage is provided for out-of-network services. For those plans with provider networks, the listing of providers can be furnished in a separate document accompanying the SPD, as long as the SPD describes the provider network and states that provider lists are furnished automatically, without charge, as a separate document.\n    Also, issuers of qualified health plans (QHP) in the Exchanges and the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) must make their provider directories available online (Reference 30 below).\n    Cost sharing for lactation counseling services. Group health plans cannot impose cost sharing with respect to lactation counseling services obtained outside the network. If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide lactation counseling services, the plan or issuer must cover the item or service when performed by an out-of-network provider without cost sharing (Reference 31 below).\n    In the case where a state does not license lactation counseling providers, subject to reasonable medical management techniques, lactation counseling must be covered without cost sharing by the plan or issuer when it is performed by any provider acting within the scope of his or her license or certification under applicable state law. Lactation counseling could be provided by another provider type acting within the scope of his or her license or certification (for example, a registered nurse), and the plan or issuer would be required to provide coverage for the services without cost sharing (Reference 32 below).\n    Plans or issuers cannot impose cost sharing with respect to lactation counseling received on an outpatient basis. If a recommendation or guideline does not specify the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of a recommended preventive service, then the plan or issuer may use reasonable medical management techniques to determine any such coverage limitations. However, it is not a reasonable medical management technique to limit coverage for lactation counseling to services provided on an in-patient basis (Reference 33 below).\n    Services beyond minimums. Health plans or issuers are not barred from providing coverage for preventive care services beyond those recommended by the USPSTF. Similarly; health plans or issuers are not prohibited from denying coverage for preventive services that are not recommended by the Task Force (Reference 34 below).\n    Out-of-network providers. If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide a particular preventive service, the plan or issuer must cover the item or service when performed by an out-of-network provider and not impose cost sharing with respect to the item or service (Reference 35 below).\n    Scope, setting or frequency. If a recommendation or guideline for a recommended preventive health service does not specify the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of that service, the plan or issuer can use reasonable medical management techniques (which generally limit or exclude benefits based on medical necessity or medical appropriateness using prior authorization requirements, concurrent review, or similar practices) to determine any coverage limitations under the plan. Thus, to the extent not specified in a recommendation or guideline, a plan or issuer may rely on the relevant evidence base and these established techniques to determine the frequency, method, treatment, or setting for the provision of a recommended preventive health service (Reference 36 below).\n    Example: A group health plan does not impose a copayment for colorectal cancer preventive services when performed in an in-network ambulatory surgery center. In contrast, the same preventive service provided at an in-network outpatient hospital setting would generally require a $250 copayment.\n    This plan design is permissible. PHSA \u00a7 2713 and its implementing regulations allow plans to use reasonable medical management techniques to control costs. Plans may use reasonable medical management techniques to steer patients towards a particular high-value setting such as an ambulatory care setting for providing preventive care services, provided the plan accommodates any individuals for whom it would be medically inappropriate to have the preventive service provided in the ambulatory setting (as determined by the attending provider) by having a mechanism for waiving the otherwise applicable copayment for the preventive services provided in a hospital (Reference 37 below).\n    Cost-sharing requirements. If a recommended preventive service (RPS) is billed separately from an office visit, then cost-sharing requirements for the office visit may be imposed. If an RPS is not billed separately and the primary purpose of the visit is the delivery of a preventive item or service, then cost-sharing requirements may not be imposed. If an RPS is not billed separately but the primary purpose of the office visit is not the delivery of a preventive item or service, then cost-sharing requirements may be imposed. Also, a plan or issuer is not required to provide coverage for RPS delivered by an out-of-network provider, and may impose cost-sharing requirements on recommended preventive services delivered by an out-of-network provider (Reference 38 below).\n    If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide a particular preventive service, the plan or issuer must cover the item or service when performed by an out-of-network provider and not impose cost sharing with respect to the item or service (Reference 39 below).\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a7 2713(a) (1).\n2 ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2713(a)(1).\n3 ERISAReg. \u00a7 2590.715-2713(c).\n4 www.ahrq.gov/clinic.\n5 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII), Q4, February 20, 2013.\n6 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXIX), Q7 & Q8, October 23, 2015.\n7 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII), Q5, February 20, 2013.\n8 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII), Q6, February 20, 2013.\n9 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXIX), Ql0, October 23, 2015.\n10 FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XVIII) and Mental Health Parity Implementation, January 9, 2014.\n11 FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation (Part XIX), Q5, May 2, 2014.\n12 FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXIX), Q6, October 23, 2015.\n13 www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/\n14 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XXVI), May 11, 2015.\n15 FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation, (Part XII, Q14 & 15), February 20, 2013.\n16 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 375 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Typically Covered Health Care Services\n      Employers have great flexibility as to what their health plans cover. Most health plans, however, cover the following health expenses:\n\u25a1 treatment of illness, disease, or accidents;\n\u25a1 medical, surgical, exploratory, therapeutic, or emergency care;\n\u25a1 inpatient hospital room, incidentals, and treatment;\n\u25a1 outpatient surgery and treatment;\n\u25a1 doctor's office visits and treatment;\n\u25a1 nursing services, whether inpatient, outpatient, or home health care;\n\u25a1 diagnostic care, such as X-rays, MRIs, or blood tests;\n\u25a1 prescription drugs;\n\u25a1 dental, vision, or hearing care if required due to an accident or injury;\n\u25a1 pregnancy and childbirth costs;\n\u25a1 durable medical equipment purchase or rental; and\n\u25a1 specialty care, such as the intensive care unit.\n\nExclusions\n    As broad-based as coverage has become, there are still treatments or services that are generally excluded from coverage under corporate health care programs. Generally excluded are charges for:\n1. treatment for work-related injuries or for services which would be covered under workers' compensation;\n2. services or supplies not recommended by a physician;\n3. charges that exceed amounts the plan defines as reasonable and customary;\n4. services or supplies that are furnished or paid for due to service in the military;\n5. cosmetic surgery;\n6. experimental procedures, drugs, or surgery; or\n7. dental or eye treatments that are specifically excluded.\n    Effect of exclusion. When a plan excludes coverage for services by specific types of providers or excludes services from coverage, the expenses incurred by employees or dependents from these providers are ineligible for reimbursement from the plan. In addition, the expenses do not apply toward the satisfaction of the deductible.\n\nPreexisting conditions\n    Most plans exclude coverage for specific conditions when the patient had previously been diagnosed or treated for the condition, which are called preexisting conditions. Normally, this is an exclusion for a specific period of time, such as six months. If an individual does not seek treatment or consult with a doctor for that period of time, the plan fully covers that person.\n    Pointer: A preexisting condition clause for a specific condition does not affect the employee or dependent's eligibility or enrollment in a plan. The plan may cover the employee or dependent in all other respects and exclude benefits for services only in connection with the preexisting condition. Nonetheless, the practical effect might be to limit an employee's options for example, if an employee has a choice between an insurance plan, with preexisting condition exclusions, and an HMO with no such exclusions, the employee's choice may be limited.\n    Exclusion eliminated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) eliminates the use of a preexisting condition exclusion for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014 (Reference 1 below). Group health plans and health insurance issuers may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion to limit or deny coverage. This provision, as it applies to enrollees who are under 19 years of age, became effective for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010 (Reference 2 below).\n\nDefinitions\n    Although medical expenses ate covered by a health plan, they may not necessarily be paid for by the plan. Limits on benefits, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and lifetime maximums, may be imposed.\n    Deductible. An initial co-payment that applies to all expenses or only to specific types of expenses. Medical plans have individual, family, or per person deductibles and may have a family maximum deductible. The deductible may be a flat dollar amount (for example, $200 or $500), a percentage of salary (for example, 1 percent of base salary up to $500), or a per claim amount (for example, $5 or $10).\n    Coinsurance. A sharing of expenses, often on an 80-20 basis, between the employer-sponsored medical plan and the employee. Some programs increase the coinsurance percentage paid by the plan to 90 or even 100 percent when employees select certain health care providers, have treatment performed in a certain way, or follow certain rules.\n    Out-of-pocket maximum. An amount that is the maximum amount an employee is required to contribute toward medical plan costs during the plan year. This includes payments made by the employee for the deductible and coinsurance amounts, but would not include disallowed expenses.\n    Annual or lifetime maximums. A maximum benefit amount representing the most the plan would pay on behalf of one person for either a year or a lifetime, either for one type of condition or for all medical expenses. Annual maximums are often applied to outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient substance abuse treatment. A plan's lifetime maximum benefit payment typically is $1,000,000.\n    Note that for plan years beginning on or after September 23, 2010, lifetime or annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary are prohibited. A transition rule applied for plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, during which a restricted annual limit was permitted on the dollar value of benefits regarding the scope of essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Per beneficiary lifetime or annual limits are not prohibited on benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under federal or state law (Reference 3 below).\n    Pointer: \"Essential health benefits\" include ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and pediatric services.\n    The restriction on annual limits does not apply to FSAs, HSAs or MSAs (Reference 4 below).\n    The lifetime and annual limits restriction rules do not prevent a group health plan from placing annual or lifetime dollar limits with respect to any individual on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under applicable federal or state law (Reference 5 below). In addition, group health plans are not prevented from excluding all benefits for a condition. However, if any benefits are provided for a condition, then the lifetime and annual limits restriction rules apply. Note that other requirements of federal or state law may require coverage of certain benefits (Reference 6 below).\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n1 PHSA \u00a72704(a), as added by Act Sec. 1201(2) (A) of the Patient Protection and Afforda\u00ad ble Care Act (P.L.111-148).\n2 Act Sec. 10103(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148), amending Act Sec. 1253 of the Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-152).\n3 PHSA \u00a72711, as added by Act Sec. 1001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act il375 (P.L. 111-148), as amended by.Affordable Care Act Sec. 10101(a).\n4 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711 (a)(2) (ii); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(a)(2) (ii).\n5 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (1); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(1).\n6 IRS Reg. \u00a7 54.9815-2711(b) (2); ERISA Reg. \u00a7 2590.715-2711(b)(2).\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 370 - Health Benefits - Types of Health Insurance Protection - Health Insurance Benefits\n    The type of protection afforded employees depends on the kinds of benefits being provided and the way in which they are paid. Payment may be through insurance premiums, via a trust or fund, or directly from the employer. Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of coverage or incur costs such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n\nHealth insurance\n    Health insurance may be an umbrella for medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits, although each of these may also be separate plans or part of a cafeteria plan (see KB-1 Topic 2000). In addition, specific benefits such as mental health, substance abuse management, and prescription drugs, although often part of the health plan, are receiving separate attention due to escalating costs and societal concerns.\n    Medical. Medical coverage protects employees and their families from the total cost burden of the treatment of disease, illness, pregnancy and birth, or accidents and the prevention of disease. Medical. plans cover care delivered in hospitals, physicians' offices, and outpatient settings. Increasingly, the cost of the coverage is shared between employers and employees through employee contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance.\n    Dental. Dental plans cover treatment and preventive care of the teeth, gums, and mouth. Coverage normally is provided through insured plans, self-insured plans, and health maintenance organizations. Plan design varies for certain types of care, such as orthodontia, preventive mali:i.tenance, cosmetic and voluntary procedures, and for coinsurance percentages (see KB-1 Topic 385).\n    Vision. A vision plan is not a common benefit, although certain injuries to eyes may be covered under most medical plans. A vision benefit plan could underwrite the cost of eye examinations, eyeglasses or contact lenses, and eye surgery. Some provide discounted prices for eyeglasses and examinations (see KB-1 Topic 390).\n    Hearing. Separate hearing benefit plans occur in a few union plans, but are a rarity. The plans provide payment for the diagnosis, fitting, and purchase of hearing aids and the treatment of hearing loss.\n    Mental health. Mental health coverage is usually part of the medical plan, although some companies have provided employee assistance programs (EAPs), preferred provider networks (PPOs), and managed care counselling to facilitate treatment outside the traditional medical plan. The benefit plan generally covers a certain number of days per year in an inpatient setting or pays a portion of the cost of outpatient treatment for a specified number of visits to a licensed provider.\n    Pointer: Annual and lifetime dollar limits can be no more restrictive than the limits for medical/surgical coverage. In the past, the Mental Health Parity Act contained a sunset provision. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), the mental health parity provisions will no longer expire. In addition, the provisions have been enhanced and substance abuse coverage has been added. For more information, see r 400.\n    Substance abuse management. \u00b7treatment for substance abuse has also become a growth industry and a problem for employers. Inpatient detoxification is normally part of the medical plan or health maintenance organization coverage (see KB-1 Topic 405). However, ongoing outpatient therapy often is arranged on an exception basis by the insurer and the employer, using a case manager as an intermediary (see r 960).\n    Prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage is part of most medical plans. Independent drug plans, however, have become a popular alternative for larger companies as an adjunct to the medical plan. These offer generic drug substitution at prices lower than available over the counter and are often done on a mail-order basis. Prescription drug plans can produce cost savings for beneficiaries undergoing long-term therapies to treat illnesses such as diabetes or high blood pressure (see r 380).\n \nPayment mechanisms\n    Benefits may be insured, partially insured, or self-insured. Further, they are funded, self-funded, or unfunded. This terminology refers to the manner in which an employer shares the risk of the cost of claims and pays for the coverage (see also KB-1 Topic 500).\n\nInsured benefits\n    Medical, dental, vision, and hearing benefits may be fully insured through insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations, health mainte\u00ad nance organizations, preferred provider networks, associations, or welfare funds.\n    Fully insured benefits. When benefits are fully insured, the insurer estimates the total claim liability for all employees and beneficiaries and adds the projected cost for expenses such as administration, marketing, accounting reserves and trend to develop a cost for the plan year. This estimate represents the total cost for the employer for the plan year. The insurer absorbs any charges above the amount and profit when the total costs are below the estimate. The employer remits a premium on a monthly basis to the insurer.\n    Partially insured arrangement. Under a partially insured arrangement, a portion of estimated claims is insured, usually under stop loss policies, while the rest of the claims are paid on a self-insured basis.\n    Self-insured benefits. An employer that self-insures reimburses the claim payer for claims as they come due or on a delayed basis under agreement with the claim payer. In a self-insured arrangement, the employer assumes the responsibility for the entire cost of paying and processing the claims. A company contracting with an outside provider, such as a managed care vendor or mail-order drug supplier, may negotiate a contract involving minimal risk on either party and pay a charge based on the number of participants per month or on a formula representing the actual costs.\n\nFunding\n    Regardless of whether benefits are provided through insurance or self-insurance, the employer may fully or partially fund the benefits. A fully funded plan involves setting aside anticipated claim costs on a regular basis, sometimes using a trust. An unfunded plan would deduct claim costs from the general assets of the employer on an as-needed basis, with no advance reserving or budgeting. Sometimes funding arrangements are negotiated that involve a delay in remitting payment, subject to an interest charge.\n    A smaller employer is more likely to fully insure and fully fund a welfare benefit program, while larger companies tend to self-insure and self-fund, often with some form of stop-loss insurance as protection against catastrophic claims (see KB-1 Topic 470).\n \nEmployee cost participation\n    Employees may or may not be required to contribute toward the cost of insurance. In addition, employees often share in the cost of benefits through deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments (see KB-1 Topic 375).\n\nFor more information ...\n    Employer funding of health plans is discussed at KB-1 Topic 455.\n"

Like an HMO, the insurance company negotiates discounts with physicians and the hospitals and adds them to its \"network\" of providers. Employees enrolled in a PPO plan are encouraged to choose doctors and hospitals from the network.

Also, you can see a physician outside of the network and you'll probably have your cost covered (although likely at a lower rate than for in-network physicians). However, premiums are usually higher than in HMOs and it's usual to have a deductible amount you have to meet each plan year before coverage kicks in.\n\n"

                    "text": "KB-5 - Managed Care Plans - Preferred-Provider Organizations\n\n\tA concept that continues to receive considerable attention from employers and insurance companies is the preferred-provider organization. A few PPOs existed on a small scale for many years, but since the early 1980s PPOs have grown steadily in number and in membership. Today, PPOs provide coverage for medical expenses to more Americans than do HMOs, primarily because of the flexibility of covered persons to choose their own medical providers.\n\nWhat Is a PPO?\npreferred-provider organization (PPO)\n\tThe term preferred-provider organization (PPO) tends to be used in two ways. One way is to apply it to health care providers that contract with employers, insurance companies, union trust funds, third-party administrators, or others to provide medical care services at a reduced fee. Using this definition, a PPO may be organized by the providers themselves or by other organizations, such as insurance companies, the Blues, HMOs, or employers. Like HMOs, they may take the form of group practices or separate individual practices. They may provide a broad array of medical services, including physicians' services, hospital care, laboratory costs, and home health care, or they may be limited only to hospitalization or physicians' services. Some of these organizations are very specialized and provide specific services, such as dental care, mental health benefits, substance abuse services, maternity care, or prescription drugs. This book refers to these providers not as PPOs but as preferred providers or network providers.\n\tThe second use of the term PPO, and the one generally assumed when the term is used throughout this book, is to apply it to benefit plans that contract with preferred providers to obtain lower-cost care for plan members. PPOs typically differ from HMOs in several respects. First, the PPO generally pays the preferred providers on a fee-for-service basis as their services are used. However, fees are usually subject to a schedule that is the same for all similar providers within the provider network, and providers may have an incentive to control utilization through bonus arrangements. Second, employees and their dependents are not required to use the practitioners or facilities that contract with the PPO; rather, they can make a choice each time medical care is needed, and the PPO also pays benefits for care provided that nonnetwork providers furnish. However, employees have incentives to use network providers; they include lower or reduced deductibles and copayments as well as increased benefits, such as preventive health care. Third, most PPOs do not use a primary care physician as a gatekeeper; employees do not need referrals to see specialists.\n\tEmployers were disappointed with some of the early PPOs. Although discounts were available to members, they seemed to have little effect on benefit costs because discounts were from higher-than-average fees, or providers were more likely to perform diagnostic tests or prolong hospital stays to generate additional fees to compensate for the discounts. These PPOs seldom lasted long. Successful PPOs today emphasize quality care and utilization review. In selecting physicians and hospitals, PPOs look both at the type of care provided and the provider's cost effectiveness. In this era of fierce competition among medical care providers, these physicians and hospitals are often willing to accept discounts in hopes of increasing patient volume. It is also important for a PPO to monitor and control utilization on an ongoing basis and to deal with groups of preferred providers that monitor their own costs and utilization. Generally, however, PPOs do not monitor their preferred providers as closely as HMOs do.\n\nVariations\n\tOver time, PPOs have continued to evolve. A few PPOs compensate providers on a capitation basis, and a few others perform a gatekeeper function. If a member's primary care physician does not recommend a specialist, PPO benefits may be reduced. With these changes, it is sometimes difficult to determine the exact form of a managed care organization. However, those that operate as traditional HMOs generally provide medical expense coverage at a slightly lower cost than do those that operate as traditional PPOs, but there are wide variations among HMOs as well as among PPOs. Therefore, a careful analysis of quality of care, cost, and financial stability is necessary before the selection of a particular HMO or PPO.\n\nexclusive-provider organization (EPO)\n\tAnother variation of the PPO is the exclusive-provider organization, or EPO. The primary difference is that an EPO does not provide coverage outside the preferred-provider network, except in emergencies and those infrequent cases when the network does not contain an appropriate specialist. This aspect of an EPO makes it very similar to an HMO. The number of EPOs is small.\n\nSponsorship\n\tInsurance companies and the Blues established most of the early PPOs to provide products to compete with HMOs. In the early part of this decade, the number of PPOs grew significantly to over 1,000. However, primarily because of mergers, the number has decreased. The majority are still owned by insurance companies and the Blues. Some are owned by HMOs to give them another product in their health plan portfolios to offer employers. Others have a variety of ownership forms, including third-party administrators, private investors, and groups of physicians and/or hospitals.\n\nBenefit Structure\ncenters of excellence\n\tThe basic benefit structure of a PPO is very similar to that of the traditional comprehensive major medical contract. The most significant difference is that there is a higher level of benefits for care received from network providers than there is for care received from nonnetwork providers. Many PPOs have extensive networks of preferred providers, particularly in the geographic areas in which they operate, and there is little reason to seek care outside the network. Some of these PPOs also have reciprocity agreements elsewhere with networks of other PPOs and hospitals (called centers of excellence) that have excellent outcomes and reputations for certain types of medical procedures, such as cancer treatment, organ transplants, or burn treatment. Under these agreements, the PPO pays benefits as if a member receives care from network providers. Other PPOs have more limited networks, and the need and desire for treatment from nonnetwork providers is greater.\n\tThe level of benefits under PPOs may vary because of differences in deductibles, coinsurance, and precertification rules. There may also be a few additional benefits that are available only if a member receives care from a network provider. Finally, the procedures for filing claims also differ. The major purpose of these differences is to encourage an employee or dependent to receive care from preferred providers who agree to charge the plan a discounted fee.\n\nDeductibles\n\tA PPO may have annual deductibles that apply separately to network and nonnetwork charges. For examples, these might be $500 and $1,000, respectively. However, some PPOs have no deductible for network charges. A PPO may waive deductibles for some medical services, such as emergency services.\n\nCoinsurance\n\tPPOs often use coinsurance percentages that are 20 percent (and occasionally 30 percent) lower when a member receives care from nonnetwork providers. A frequently found provision applies 90 percent coinsurance to network charges and 70 percent coinsurance to nonnetwork charges. Coinsurance provisions of 100/80, 90/80, 100/70, and 80/60 are also commonly used. As with deductibles, a PPO may waive the percentage participation for certain medical services. In addition, different stop-loss limits or coinsurance caps, such as $1,000 and $3,000, may apply to network and nonnetwork charges.\n\tAlthough PPOs typically have higher coinsurance percentages for network charges than do traditional major medical plans, a covered person may be responsible for copayments in some circumstances. For example, there might be a copayment, typically ranging from $10 to $25, for each a visit to a primary care physician.\n\nallowable charge\n\tIn evaluating PPOs, it is important to determine the basis the PPO uses to apply the coinsurance percentage. For example, assume a plan uses 80 percent coinsurance for nonnetwork charges and that a charge of $100 is incurred for a medical procedure from a nonnetwork provider. Most PPOs first determine whether this charge is usual, customary, and reasonable. If it is, the plan pays $80. If the plan determines that the usual, customary, and reasonable charge is $90, it will be 80 percent of that amount, or $72. However, some plans apply the coinsurance percentage to what they often refer to as an allowable charge. In most cases, this is the amount that the PPO pays to network providers for the same procedure. In some cases, network discounts are quite large and, for example, the allowable charge in this example might be only $60. For a nonnetwork charge, the plan pays 80 percent of this amount, or $48. Thus the insured has an out-of-pocket expense of $52. Few employees and their families will seek nonnetwork care under this type of plan. For this reason, plans that pay nonnetwork charges on this basis are sometimes referred to as phantom PPOs.\n\nPrecertification Rules\n\tPPOs often have precertification requirements for many types of hospitalizations, outpatient procedures, and medical supplies. For network benefits, the person responsible for obtaining the needed certification is the network provider, and the PPO does not penalize a member if the network provider fails to obtain the proper precertification. (This becomes an issue between the PPO and the provider.) However, this responsibility shifts to the employee or family member for nonnetwork services. If he or she does not obtain a required precertification, there usually is a reduction in benefits. For example, what was once 80 percent coinsurance might shrink to 60 percent.\n\nAdditional Network Benefits\n\tFor the most part, PPOs pay benefits for the same medical procedures, whether a network or a nonnetwork provider performs them. However, some PPOs cover a few procedures only if a member receives them from network providers.\n\nClaims\n\tNo claim forms are required for network services. The covered person merely pays any required copayment, and the provider of medical services does the paperwork needed to receive the additional amounts payable by the plan. Just as in traditional major medical plans, it is the ultimate responsibility of the covered person to file the claims forms necessary to receive benefits for nonnetwork care. Of course, the provider may do much of the paperwork and accept an assignment of benefits.\n\nExample\nThe following table shows excerpts of the benefit structure from a sample PPO.\n\nTable 9-2 Selected Benefits under a Sample PPO\n\tNetwork Benefit\tNonnetwork Benefit\nDeductible\tNone\t$500 per person per year.

In fact, they were largely unregulated. As a result, the NAIC created the Preferred Provider Arrangements Model Act, which the majority of states adopted. The act is relatively brief and establishes only a minimal regulatory framework. The act requires that PPOs incorporate cost-containment mechanisms, such as utilization review, to determine whether a service is medically necessary.

Actual fee amounts are set out in the policyholder's insurance plan. co-pays, like coinsurance, are a way for insurers to share the cost of medical services with their policyholders and can take effect either before or after the policy's deductible amount has been met.\n\n                       Visits to a policyholder's primary care physician are a common case where the insurer waives the deductible amount and the insured only pays the co-pay fee, which is a small fraction of the actual charges. Generally that arrangement only applies to the first few doctor visits during the year. Once the policyholder exceeds the allowed number of visits, then he or she has to pay 100 percent of the bill until the deductible is met. At that point the co-pay amount applies again for the remainder of the year.\n\n                       Coinsurance, like a co-payment, is a method of sharing the cost of medical services or drugs between the insurer and the policyholder. Unlike co-payments, coinsurance is calculated as a percentage of the bill, rather than a flat fee, and normally applies only after the deductible amount of the policy is met. For example, if you have a 20% coinsurance, you pay 20% of each medical bill, and your health insurance will cover the other 80%.\n\n                       As with co-payments, there may be different coinsurance percentages for different services, such as x-rays, lab work, or colonoscopy. Different percentages may also apply to members of a network like a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) who see a physician outside of the policy's network.\n\n"

For example, short and long-term disability insurance can be offered under a 125 plan, but it may work out better for an employee to choose it as a post-tax benefit. If the insurance premiums are paid pre-tax then the disability payments will be taxable. Since disability payments generally don't make up for loss of normal income, employees generally prefer to have those payments be non-taxable, which means the Cafeteria Plan deductions for short or long-term disability should be made as post-tax contributions."

                    "text": "KB-5 - Consumer-Directed Medical Expense Plans - General Approaches\n\n\tThere are two general approaches to consumer-directed medical expense plans-defined-contribution medical expense plans and the use of savings accounts.\n\nDefined-Contribution Medical Expense Plans\n\tEven though some consumer-directed approaches for medical expense plans are still relatively new, they have existed in the form of the defined-contribution medical expense plan for some time. For example, many employers make two or more medical expense plans available to their employees, such as an HMO, a PPO, and an indemnity plan. The employer contribution to the cost of coverage for each plan may be a dollar amount that is pegged to a fixed percentage of the cost of the least expensive plan, usually an HMO. Therefore, an employee who elects a more expensive PPO or indemnity plan must make a greater out-of-pocket contribution for his or her coverage than if the HMO had been selected. Certain forms of cafeteria plans also incorporate a defined-contribution approach for medical expense plans.\n\nEXAMPLE\nThe Weir Corporation makes three medical expense plans available to its employees-an HMO, a point-of-service plan, and a PPO. For self-only coverage, the corporation pays an amount equal to 90 percent of the cost of the least expensive plan, which is the HMO. For the three plans, the employee contribution is as follows:\n\nTotal Monthly Premium\tEmployer\tEmployee\n\t\t\tContribution\tContribution\nHMO\t$344.00\t$309.60\t$34.40\nPOS Plan\t413.34\t309.60\t103.74\nPPO\t523.86\t309.60\t214.26\nThe corporation uses a similar approach to determine the cost of dependent coverage for which it contributes an amount equal to 50 percent of the cost of HMO coverage.\n\n\tThere is no question that defined-contribution plans over time have driven large numbers of employees to medical expense plans with higher degrees of managed care. However, managed care plans historically have provided a broad scope of coverage, including prescription drugs, yet limited the member's payment for these services to relatively modest copayments. In doing so, these plans greatly diminish the motivation of their members to contain costs when they seek services. From a member's viewpoint, the broad array of services is available for only the cost of the copayments. Even as many managed care plans have become less restrictive, copayment levels have often changed little. Such marginal copayments applicable to the wide array of more easily available services may explain, at least in part, the decline in overall personal out-of-pocket payments from nearly 25 percent of health care spending in 1980 to less than 15 percent by the late 1990s (Reference 24 below). However, this is changing somewhat as more employers adopt or revise their medical expense plans so that employees have higher deductibles and larger copayments. In 2010, the American Association of Preferred Provider Organization estimates that 28 million people were enrolled in CDHPs, up from 23 million in 2009 - a 22 percent growth rate (Reference 25 below).\n\nUse of Savings Accounts\nhigh-deductible health plan (HDHP)\n\tNewer types of defined-contribution medical expense plans have features other than just fixed employer contributions. At a minimum, these approaches force employees to make financial decisions involving their health care. Typically, an employer might provide employees with a medical expense plan that has a very high deductible, perhaps as much as $5,000 per year. This type of plan is often referred to as a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The employer also contributes a lower or equal amount, such as $2,500 per year, to some type of savings account from which the employee can make withdrawals to pay medical expenses that the health plan does not cover because of the deductible. These funds are often withdrawn with an electronic payment card (such as a debit card), which has a dollar limit equal to the available savings account balance. The employee can carry forward any unused amount in the account without it affecting the next year's contribution to the account. Such a plan gives the employee an immediate incentive to purchase medical care wisely because, if the amount in the account is exceeded, the employee will have to pay the full cost of medical expenses out of his or her own pocket until the plan's high deductible is satisfied. The plan often incorporates a preferred-provider network of health care professionals. As long as an employee receives medical treatment within the network, any charges that the employee must pay because of the deductible are limited to the amount negotiated with the preferred provider.\n\tEmployers might use this approach for all employees, but many employers make it available as an option to a more traditional medical expense plan. In addition, because of the newness of the approach to providing medical expense coverage, some employers limit these plans to a select group of employees on a trial basis.\n\tThe rationale for using a high-deductible medical expense plan along with a savings account is that significant cost savings can occur for two primary reasons. First, the expensive cost of administering and paying small claims is largely eliminated, as demonstrated by the fact that a major medical policy with a $2,500 deductible can often be purchased for about one-half the cost of a policy with a $250 deductible. Second, employees now have a direct financial incentive to avoid unnecessary care and to seek out the most cost-effective form of treatment.\n\tA small number of employers have used this approach for some time with positive results. Costs have been lowered or have risen less rapidly than would otherwise be expected. Reactions of employees have generally been favorable, but until federal legislation in the late 1990s there was one major drawback-employer contributions to a savings account constituted taxable income to employees.\n\tAs with almost any approach to cost containment, this type of medical expense plan has its critics. They argue that employees will minimize treatment for minor medical expenses and preventive care that would have been covered under a plan without a high deductible. Critics contend that this avoidance of medical care may lead to major expenses that could have been averted or minimized with earlier treatment. However, some types of consumer-directed medical expense plans pay for preventive care without regard to the deductible. Another criticism is that a high-deductible plan tends to favor healthy individuals and those in high tax brackets. A third criticism is that this type of medical expense plan does not focus on the problem of the uninsured. In rebuttal to this criticism, proponents argue that any technique that lowers costs for employers will ultimately benefit everyone and encourage small employers to provide coverage that would have previously been unaffordable. A final criticism is that these plans are just another way of shifting more medical costs to employees.\n\tSome consumer-directed medical expense plans using the savings-account approach have been designed so that employer decisions about specific benefit plans are eliminated, or at least minimized. Some employers view this as a way of minimizing their legal exposure for health care decisions because a certain level of responsibility is transferred back to employees and health care providers. Under such a plan, an employee can use an employer contribution (along with any additionally needed employee contribution) to shop at some type of \"health care supermarket,\" where many different types of medical expense plans are available. These plans are often required to provide detailed information about their operations so that consumers can make more informed decisions when selecting a medical expense plan. An insurer or some type of Internet marketer may offer these plans, and the employer may or may not be involved in the selection of the supermarket that an employee uses. Most consumer-directed medical expense plans that use the savings-account approach, however, only make a single medical expense plan available to employees.\n\tTwo tax-favored approaches use savings accounts:\n\u2022 health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs)\n\u2022 health savings accounts (HSAs)\n\tHRAs can only be established by employers for their employees. HSAs can be established by either employers or individuals. Archer MSAs are also briefly mentioned. However, new Archer MSAs can no longer be established, but some employees may still have them.\n\tIt is common for employers to establish flexible spending accounts (FSAs) so that their employees can elect before-tax salary reductions to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses. There are those who argue that FSAs are a form of consumer-directed health plan. However, they can be viewed primarily as an aspect of a cafeteria plan that provides federal income tax benefits to employees when they are properly used.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n24.

                    "text": "KB-3 - Section 125 Cafeteria Plans - How does a health care Flexible Spending Account work? \n\n\tA medical Flexible Spending Account (also known as a flexible spending arrangement or FSA) is a special account that an employee can put pre-tax money into to pay for certain out-of\u00adpocket health care costs not covered by insurance. Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\n\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n\u2022 FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n\u2022 There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of\u00adpocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax\u00adfree dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n\u2022 Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n\u2022 Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n\u2022 Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n\u2022 Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n\u2022 Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n\u2022 Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n\u2022 Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n\u2022 There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n\u2022 The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n\u2022 Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n\u2022 Elect to provide a 2 \u00bd month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account. When the grace period ends the remaining funds become the property of the employer.\n\nNote: IRS Publication 502 has a list of what medical items are and aren't covered by an FSA.\n"

                    "text": "KB-1 - KB-1 Topic 2215 - Health Care Spending Accounts\n\tGenerally, a health care flexible spending account (FSA) is designed to pay an employee's medical and dental expenses in pre-tax dollars. The annual deductibles for the medical and dental portions of the employer-provided health care plan, as well as expenses not covered by the plan (e.g., eye examinations, glasses, hearing aids, and orthodontia), can be reimbursed from the health care FSA\n\t2020 annual limits. Effective for tax years beginning in 2020, a health FSA will not be a qualified benefit under a cafeteria plan unless the plan provides for a $2,750 maximum salary reduction contribution to the FSA. (Reference 1 below) If the plan does allow salary reductions in excess of $2,750, then an employee will be subject to tax on distributions from the health FSA, thereby eliminating any of the tax benefits of health FSA contributions. Indexing of the annual limit applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 2013. The IRS has clarified that the term \"taxable year\" refers to the plan year of the cafeteria plan as this is the period for which salary\u00ad reduction elections are made. Furthermore, in the case of a plan providing a grace period (which may be up to two months and 15 days), unused salary-reduction contributions to the health FSA for plan years beginning in 2012 or later that are carried over into the grace period for that plan year will not count against the annual limit for the subsequent plan year. The IRS has also provided relief for certain salary-reduction contributions exceeding the annual limit that are due to a reasonable mistake and not willful neglect and that are corrected by the employer. (Reference 2 below)\n\tBenefits provided under health care FSAs are treated as \"excepted benefits\" under HIPAA-see KB-1 Topic 2226.\n\nPremiums for other health coverage\n\tA health care spending account cannot be used to pay the premiums for other health care coverage, such as an individual health plan premium, Medicare premiums, or group health insurance premiums incurred by the employee's spouse. (Reference 3 below)\n\tPointer: Although health care FSAs cannot be used to pay premiums for other health care coverage, premiums for current health plan coverage (including coverage under a health care FSA) may still be paid on a salary reduction basis through the ordinary operation of the cafeteria plan.\n\nFSA insurance features\n\tFSAs are required to incorporate features that are commonly associated with insurance arrangements, such as basic risk-shifting and risk-spreading characteristics. (Reference 4 below)\n\nReimbursement for incurred medical expenses\nReimbursements under health care FSAs must be paid specifically to reimburse the participant for medical expenses incurred previously during the period of coverage. (Reference 5 below) A health care FSA cannot operate under a cafeteria plan in a manner that enables participants to receive coverage only for periods for which the participants expect to incur medical expenses if such periods constitute less than a plan year.\n\tA reimbursement is not paid specifically to reimburse the participant for medical expenses if the participant is entitled to these amounts in the form of cash or any other taxable or nontaxable benefit, including health care coverage for an additional period, without regard to whether the employee incurs medical expenses during the period. A health care FSA cannot qualify for tax-favored treatment if the effect of the reimbursement arrangement eliminates all, or substantially all, risk of loss to the employer maintaining the plan or to the other insurer.\n\tPointer: Employers may wish to keep FSA participants informed of reimbursed expenses and account balances by issuing FSA status memos. This memo could also be used to remind participants of the deadline for submitting claims for the current year.\n \nAvailability of maximum reimbursement\n\tThe maximum amount of reimbursement elected by each participant must be available to the participant throughout the coverage period, subject to reduction for prior claims paid. (Reference 6 below) The amount of the available reimbursement cannot be based on the amount of premiums paid by the individual at the time the claim is made, nor can an employer accelerate the premium payment schedule based upon claims.\n\tReimbursement will be deemed to be available at all times: (Reference 7 below)\n\t1. if it is paid at least monthly; or\n\t2. when the total amount of the claims submitted is at least a specified minimum amount (e.g., $50).\n\tIf the employee revokes existing elections, the employer must reimburse the employee for any amount previously paid for coverage or benefits relating to the period after the date of the employee's separation from service, regardless of the employee's claims or reimbursements as of such date. (Reference 8 below)\n\tExample 1: Employee Arnold Carter elects coverage under a health care FSA providing coverage of up to $300 in medical expenses, and the annual premium for a calendar year of coverage is $300. Arnold is permitted to pay the $300 premium through salary reductions of $25 per month throughout the coverage period. He must be eligible to receive the maximum amount of reimbursement of $300 at all times throughout the coverage period (reduced by prior reimbursements).\n\tThus, if Arnold incurs $250 of medical expenses in January, the full $250 must be available for reimbursement even though he has made only one premium payment. If Arnold incurs another $50 in health expenses in February, the remaining $50 of the $300 maximum must be available for reimbursement. The employer or plan may not provide for an acceleration of the required premium payments based on Arnold's incurred claims and reimbursements.\n\tExample 2: Employee Ernie Brock elects coverage under a health care FSA with a maximum reimbursement limit of $500 for a calendar year of coverage and is required to pay the $450 premium for such coverage in two equal $225 installments, one at the beginning of the period of coverage and the second installment by the beginning of the sixth month of coverage. Ernie incurs a\n$400 medical expense in February, and the FSA makes a $400 reimbursement to the employee in March. Ernie does not incur any additional medical expenses before the end of June, at which time he separates from service.\n\tIf Ernie fails to make the second premium installment, his coverage under the FSA may be terminated as of the end of June so that medical expenses incurred after June are not covered. If Ernie pays the second premium installment, his coverage under the FSA must continue, so that additional medical expenses (up to the remaining $100) incurred before the end of December are covered.\n \nTwelve-month period of coverage\n\tA health care FSA must provide coverage for a period of 12 months, although there are exceptions for short first plan years or short plan years when the entire cafeteria plan year is being changed. (Reference 9 below) Election changes to increase or decrease the level of coverage under a health care FSA during the 12-month period of coverage are not permitted. However, a cafeteria plan may permit participants to make health care FSA election changes if there is a change in the employee's status(see KB-1 Topic 2070).\n\tEmployees who make the total premium payment for the 12-month period cannot be terminated from the health care FSA merely because they separate from service with the employer. (Reference 10 below)\n\tExample 3: Ellen Nelson has elected a $300 calendar year health care FSA, with monthly premium payments of $25 during the 12-month period of cover\u00ad age. She separates from the service of her employer at the end of June and ceases to make additional premium payments. The cafeteria plan may provide that the FSA's period of coverage does not extend beyond June if she does not continue to make the required premium payments. However, if Ellen makes the total premium payment for the 12-month period of coverage, the cafeteria plan may not terminate the FSA's period of coverage merely because she separated from service before the end of the coverage period.\n\nProhibited reimbursements\n\tReimbursements under health care FSAs must be paid specifically to reimburse medical expenses incurred during the coverage period. A health care FSA cannot reimburse participants for premiums for other health coverage. This includes premiums paid for health coverage maintained by the employer of the employee's spouse or dependent. (Reference 11 below) A health care FSA cannot reimburse partici\u00ad pants for expenses incurred for cosmetic surgery except in certain circumstances\n(see KB-1 Topic 2250).
