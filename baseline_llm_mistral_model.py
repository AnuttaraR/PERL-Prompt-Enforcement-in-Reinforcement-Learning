In addition, benefit brokers can negotiate with plan providers to try to secure the lowest cost possible. A major advantage of working with benefit brokers is that there's no cost to the employer since brokers are paid in commissions from the plan providers based on the business the broker brings in.",

Other 'most wanted' benefits include overtime pay, paid medical leave, dental and vision coverage, and disability and life insurance. Flexible work schedules and the ability to work remotely are also becoming an important perk for employees.\nThe newest trend in employer-provided benefits?

Employers may also make contributions to FSAs but aren't required to do so.\nFacts to keep in mind about FSAs include:\n• FSAs can only be offered in conjunction with an existing group healthcare plan.\n• There are two different kinds of FSAs an employer can offer. Health FSAs allow employees to pay for out-of­pocket medical expenses with tax-free dollars. Dependent Care FSAs allow employees to pay for expenses with tax­free dollars. Employers can offer one or both types to their employees.\n• Flexible spending accounts can cover expenses like daycare, prescriptions, dental work and eye exams.\n• Employees are reimbursed for expenses with a health flexible spending account, which means bills have to be paid out of pocket and the employee has to file a claim to get reimbursed from the FSA.\n• Money contributed to a health care FSA has to be spent within the current plan year or forfeited (although employers can allow a portion of that amount to be carried over to the next plan year if they so choose).\n• Employees with a medical FSA have immediate access to the full amount they elected to contribute for the tax year (even if some or all of that amount hasn't actually been deposited yet).\n• Only full time employees are eligible to participate in a Flexible Spending Account. Part time employees (those who work less than 30 hours per week) aren't eligible for an FSA.\n• Normally, employees can't change their per pay period contribution amount once they've decided on it, but exceptions can be made for events Iike the birth of a child or the death of a spouse.\n• Employees have the option of using a debit card, also known as a Flexcard, to withdraw money directly from their FSA. Using a Flexcard has the advantage of keeping a record of all withdrawals in one place.\n• Employees under the age of 65 who spend money in their FSA on non-medical expenses have to pay income tax on that money plus a penalty (usually 20 percent of the amount spent). Employees 65 or older have to pay income tax on the non-medical expense amounts, but aren't charged a penalty.\n• There are dozens of items that qualify as medical expenses under an FSA.\n• The employer owns the FSA so employees who leave are generally no longer eligible to participate in their FSA(unless they elect continuation coverage) and they forfeit any amount remaining in their account.\n\nEmployers can choose to let participants roll some of the money in their FSA to the new plan year by using one of two options:\n• Set a limit of up to $500 and al low participants to roll that much of their unspent funds over to the new plan year.\n• Elect to provide a 2 ½ month grace period following the end of the plan year for participants to claim whatever funds are left in their account.
